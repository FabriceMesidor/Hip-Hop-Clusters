# HIP HOP CLUSTERS
Applying Natural Language Processing and machine learning to Hip-Hop lyric and song to find sub-genres and sub-categories
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# INTRO

Since 1979, rap spread from its New York epicenter throughout the remainder of the U.S. (with each region taking on its own specific flavor) and then to countless countries. Even though Rap's core components are beats and rhymes, rap lyircs got their own touch as well. Over the year, lot of people try to create genres of music of schools of rappers. Most of them very subjective and arguable. Using machine learning techniques and Natural Language Processing tools, I want to confront popular opinion and find topics & categories of Hip Hop songs.


# QUESTIONS
Questions guiding my research:

1. What are the different subjects discussed in Hip Hop?
2. How has the artist vocabulary and music changed over time?
3. Are there different clusters in Hip Hop or all music similar?
4. How did hip-hop musics change over time?

# MY DATA
55k+ Songs from 1979 to 2019 collected from 300 artists. I proceed by getting a list of rappers (814) from ranker.com then, collect the lyrics on Genuis.
After downloading songs features on SPotify - I kept only the ones with both lyrics and tracks audio features.

# Topic Modeling
After cleaning and vectorizing the lyrics, I appplied Latent Dirichent Allocation (LDA) to get topics
