We outlive labels, and distributors\nWe run laps around every artist on your payroll\nThen hop up in a Range Rov', jet black with the black rims\nKilling your bitch in her a-hole, uh-oh!\n\n[Hook: Havoc]\nBut losing ain't a option girl\nMy destination is top of the world, top of the world\nBut losing ain't a option girl\nMy destination is top of the world, top of the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b2028bc5336e13af3d91919e570f79e6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
