Who do ya luv baby?\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow you doin', miss? My name is L, I'm from Queens\nI heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream\nDolce Gabbana, Moschino with Donna jeans\nBut he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend\nHe be playin' like a Willie 'cause he dress ya dove\nNever knowin' that his woman is in need of love\nYou got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks\nOfficial hair style but you stuck up in the spot\nMakin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep\nYou on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets\nSo what you got Chanel on your feet\nHot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Verse 2]\nJew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style\nHe ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile\nCan't protect treasures when it's in a glass house\nSoon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out\nFull blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome\nYo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?\nJust because you blessed with cash\nDoesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass\nSo see the moral of the story is a woman need love\nThe kind you so-called players never dreamed of\nYou got to try love, can't buy love\nIf you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Bridge: Total + LL Cool J]\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn\nBut your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam\nMan made the money, money never made the man\nYou still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand\nSee, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown\nRock roller with so much ice your cap's polar\nI got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis\nPushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me\nI keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn\nTeaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned\nDon't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong\nBut she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone\n\n[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]\nWho do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)\nAre you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)\n\n[Bridge: Total]\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)\nWho do you love? Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)\n\n[Outro: Total]\nWho do you love? (Repeat with LL Cool J ad-libs)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45dc77bdccfd5439c618c9687b1e07c1.968x968x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
