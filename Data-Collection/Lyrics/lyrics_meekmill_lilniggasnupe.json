Is it the cars?\nIs it the way a nigga living that took me this far?\nBut still they want me with the sins and give me them bars\nThey lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star\nI shine, I grind harder, I'm working my mind smarter\nI take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter\nThey telling me I ain't shit, I made it for my father\nI just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me\n\n[Chorus]\nLil' Snupet, they killed my lil' nigga Snupe\nMy lil' nigga was the truth\nAnd all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe\nSo what's a nigga 'sposed to do?\nTell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' niggas shoot?\n'Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you\nAnd all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd as I'm rolling through my city, nigga, all I see is murder\nAin't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it\nAnd ain't nobody hiring so everybody serving\nAnd all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin', better get a strap\nYoung niggas selling 'caine just to get it back\nAnd they busting out them things 'til they sitting back\nAnd if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back\nAnd if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back\nMy flow iller, I came up from dope dealing\nI been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no\nNigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it\nI came up on four wheelers, bananas and gorillas\nThrough the jungle where killers rumble and everyone perishing\nRealest nigga in it no comparison\nAnd they got the nerve to tell me that I'm arrogant\nBut what the fuck, I'm young black, I made it in America\nSo I'ma ball harder than the mahfucking Carters\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Shawn, arm bluer than their daughter\nManeuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin\nNigga darker in a coffin, Devil on him, get 'em off, hah\nI can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg\nLeaning with your left but you still a southpaw\nBe the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg\nLeaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr. Chow's, dawg?\nWhere the love at? Where the love at?\nI'd give up all this money to get lil' cuz back\nJust for my nigga, go starving, like, \"Where the grub at?\"\nGive up the fame, start over and get my buzz back\nDo it again, murder his killer, him and his friend\nPut the arena, step on the stage, kill him again\nLook at the stands, the fans coming, filling them in\nTo give my nigga a chance, see him winning again\n\n[Chorus]\nSnupe! They killed my lil' nigga Snupe\nMy lil' nigga was the truth\nAnd all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe\nSo what's a nigga 'sposed to do?\nTell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' nigga shoot?\nCause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you\nAnd all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof\n\n[Outro]\nReal nigga for life!\nReal nigga for life!\nReal nigga for life!\nThey killed my lil' nigga Snupe!\nKilled my lil' nigga Snupe", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9f7555483900d17e5492cc73d0fff0df.600x590x1.png"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
