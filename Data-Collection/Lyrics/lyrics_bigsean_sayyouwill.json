No\nMan please do not gimmick me, put me on the shelf and not remember me\nAnd treat me like a John Doe\nI wish that I could drop my nuts in they tonsils\n(ahem) Shut up bitch swallow\nAnd I been signed to Ye for well over a year now\nIt\u2019s clear now, I'mma focus on my career now\nYou taught me to create a process\nSaying that you changed my life dog it\u2019s me being modest\nBut honestly I wish that I could take you off tour\nPut you in the studio so you could focus more on my shit\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to sound selfish\nBut I am not an artist that's selfless\nI\u2019m feeling like a crab in a bucket\nThat\u2019s just tryna get it crackin'\nAmongst all these fuckin' shellfish\n\nAnd it\u2019s a dream come true that you signed me\nBig Sean, G.O.O.D. Music signee\nPeople asking me how it happened, man I tell 'em\nI Rolex-ed the situation and just had perfect timing\nAnd you already know where to find me\nBitch I'm connected to the D like Siamese\nSo if you see me out of town getting money\nKnow I do it for my city and I be back very promptly\nSo say what up if you see us\nAnd the D is burn rubber and the Sean man lead us\nLike being undefeated, feeling undefeated\nDick so big I bust a nut for a fetus\nGlad to do any interview or dope feature\nCome holla at a nigga as I\u2019m trying on sneakers\nNiggas making diss records in efforts that I see it\nWaiting on my reply but they never will receive it\nYou are not half of what I am and can\u2019t be it\nYou are just a hundred-and-one percent bitch\nRecognize a star like you pledge to the allegiance\nAnd I don\u2019t want fans, I want believers\nRace to success so I'mma keep pedalin'\nCuz my mama man she deserve everything\nSo if I find a girl with beauty and brains like her\nThen best believe she gon' get a wedding ring\nBut I don\u2019t know if I believe in love to be honest\nCuz every girl love the headliners\nTake her to my hotel all my niggas there\nAnd best believe they gon' give us all a hair line-up\nAnd that\u2019s why girls wanna leave us\nTell 'em where we are but they never gon' believe us\nWon\u2019t stop till we end up on that show Cheaters\nBut I bet you couldn\u2019t spot me if a nigga wore cheetah\nAnd I be in the strip-club Teasers\nGiving all the girls what\u2019s needed\nHonest dog had so many problems dog\nI could hand 'em out and be labeled a fuckin' teacher\nSo respect my hand gesture\nI dare any nigga try and come test us\nYou a mothafuckin' act dog, a A.C.T. that\u2019s why niggas try and test ya\nA-Dub how the hell we gon' make a mil\nPay the bills man, I ain\u2019t tryna waste a deal\nIf you could make a deal believe you could break a deal\nAnd if you can\u2019t keep your promises then don\u2019t say you will\nNigga don't say you will", "image": "https://images.genius.com/35094fe912ce98af36fb55bca8412d23.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
