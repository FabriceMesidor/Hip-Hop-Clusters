I reply with my government, exchange the numbers\nEscapades for days, satisfying my hunger\nDon't trip, you from a long list, a long line\nGet in line, you so fucking fine, you spendin' time\nIntroduce you as a friend of mine, never my woman\nI got 20/20 cord vision, seein' you comin'\nLivin' my life, I don't need a wife\nBut you persist, tryin' to strengthen our relationship\nBut I'm a dog, and a dog gotta run the streets\nWithout a leash, this ain't workin' so I'm sayin' peace\nYou ain't the one for me!\n\n[Chorus:]\nCause she, was put here to defeat me\nCause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\nCause she, blow my phone up, to reach me\nCause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\n\n[Xzibit]\nYou found some way to hold on, through all the bullshit\nNever seen a woman so strong, I used to pull shit\nNow them days, long been gone, I gotta move in them streets\nProvide a place for all my peoples to eat\nI'm feeling stuck, had to hustle up\nThe A-T-F, hit the house, had me shackled up\nYou lost your mind, hate the time, I was in and out\nYou never let a brother down, when you stressing out\nYou stressin' wanted me, to figure out a different route\nYou could've left, but you a rider and stuck it out\nAnd it's a trip, because it's like you never missed a beat\nYou waited anxiously, patiently, stayin' strong for me\nI sat aside, thinking back to the way I was\nThe way I am, and how I gotta be a stronger man\nI understand that you love me and you want the best\nBut if you wanna take the good, you gotta take the rest\nI rock a vest, baby!\n\n[Chorus:]\nCause she, was put here to defeat me\nCause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\nCause she, blow my phone up, to reach me\nCause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\n\n[Xzibit]\nAnd all this time it was you\nBaby forgive me for the pain, I was putting you through\nIt's me and you against the world, so I'm keepin' it true\nI know I haven't been the best, the wrong things I must do\nI used to think I was the MAN, wasn't having a clue\nI wasn't looking for no love, but I found it in you\nIt's so true, behind every great man is a women\nEvery time you call me, Baby Girl, I'm a come running\nYou got a soldier livin' right, girl you saved my life\nI sacrifice, anything to keep my family tight\nI seen the light, and when the world try to beat me down\nYou always given me another reason, I can smile\nCause you believed in me, when there was nothing there to see\nMy wife can be my better half, complete my family tree\nUgh, nothing can stop us now, Vera Wang gown\nWatching your father, walk his little lady down the isle\nCause you the one for me!\n\n[Chorus:]\nCause she, was put here to defeat me\nCause she, cuss me out, quick to leave me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\nCause she, blow my phone up, to reach me\nCause she, tried to lock, now she leaves me\nCause she, not what I want, not what I want, not what I need\n\n[Outro]\nDedicated to the real ones out there\nUgh, yeah, this is for you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cebafeb87cd3844c18012605b852ac2b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
