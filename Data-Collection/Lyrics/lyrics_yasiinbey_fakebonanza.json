Ohh lord! Fake Bonanza!\n\n[Verse 2]\nGladiator, circus world\nGlamour, pussy, pimp, whole goods and services world\nParanoid, itchy trigga finga nervous world\nShade-tonic natural order in reversal world\nThe ipod, no God, zero circle world\nThe blow-a turtle world, smoke from the purple world\nThe killer murder world, hamburger murder world\nOpen twenty-four hours, all about them dollars\nPretty poison, devoid choices\nCold coffee and more coffins, fake bonanza (2x)\nHuh? What? I don't understand ya!\nWhat they talking bout save they soul, ohh lord, save they soul!\nHelp them reach the goal, peace! (4x)\nYou know, peace (3x), boogieman! Don't be scared\nOhh lord, save they soul (2x) Ohh lord, save my soul (2x) Please\nBoogieman\n\n[Outro]\nWoke up this morning with my, my state on freedom and said I\nHad the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I (2x)\nWoke up this morning in my, my state, I'm dreaming, dreaming\nAin't nothing even.....dreaming, praying, keeping\nWoke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom\nWoke up this demon that keep staying on my mind\nSaid, woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom\nIt makes no difference what people say, AHHHHHHHHH", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50acba8e30cec066c838d6f22dd475e3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
