Give me all you got of that\nDoing this for all my niggas\nWho'd rather go to prison than to let a nigga kill 'em\nSo we leaving this PO snub-nose in his denim\nTrap or death is waiting 'round the corners that he been in\nOn bended knee, God forgive us, we been sinnin'\nIn our defense, look at the options we was given\nLaying in the prison cell staring at the ceiling\nBack in this bitch again, guess they wasn't bullshitting, huh?\nStill wonder where it all went wrong\nSince Phil got killed, I ain't never moved on\nLike I\u2019m still in the club where the blows got thrown\nWhen my crown fell down and I got dethroned\nBunch of niggas around but I feel all alone\nLike a piece of me is missing; guess it never came home\nProbably died in the van when it all hit the fan\nSave the life of a friend: we don\u2019t all get the chance\nNow, here I stand, with blood on my hands\nTrying hard to explain so his mom understand\nI'm at fault for the loss of the soul of a man\nOnly soldiers know how that'll take a toll on a man\nBurdens of the world on my shoulders: heavy\nVisibly composed, my emotions: buried\nScary, so if I pop a pill\nSmoke a blunt or take a shot, y'all, let a nigga live\nStill baffled how my life unraveled\nIn the meantime, time just travelled\nCan\u2019t see behind the walls of my castle\nOpinionated peon, son, but who asked you?\nI tell you: what you do, take your 2 cents\nKick rocks to a fountain, pitch 'em and make a wish\nShit, if wishes had wings\nThey\u2019d all make it to heaven and we\u2019d all be kings\nHahaha! If wishes had wings\nThey\u2019d all make it to heaven and we\u2019d all be kings\nYeah!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6e0b92763aa55c2af243643df7b7f24c.475x475x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
