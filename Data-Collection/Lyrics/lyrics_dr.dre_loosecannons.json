What up, X?\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nSpent my birthday in Dubai\nSkyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy\nBlack tux, on you fucks\nAnd guess what? I'm ready to (blow, yo, oh no)\nI hang that 6-2 sideways\nPissin' off the neighbors, scrapin', bumpin' in the driveway\nCube gave me the pistol\nTold me to kill at will and (blow, yo, oh no)\n(I couldn't give a fuck) Literally\nCashed out just livin' to me\nBlast it like a Kennedy beat\nWanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me\nWhile I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's\nShe book smart with pornographic abilities\n(Well I don't know what you know but I know I got that shit)\nThese motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!\nThat's why they bring X and the guillotine out\nTo stop these bitch niggas from runnin' their mouth\n(It's bout time somebody said something)\n\n[Verse 4: Sly Pyper]\nOne in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber\nOne on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger\nI'm ready to die, I can't control this fuckin' anger\nAh shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me\nCause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself\nI'm bad for my own health\nYou niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else\n(Fuck 'em)\nI swear to God, I'mma do it, back the fuck up I'mma do it\nI swear to God, I'mma lose it\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, baby! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down! Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?\nOh my God\nYou is so fucked up for this\nFuck It\n*Gun cocks*\nWait, wait, wait, wait! Okay, I'm sorry! What the fuck? Don't point the fuckin' gun at me! Okay, put the fuckin' gun down! No, no, no, no!!\n*Gun shot*\nAlright, I got the legs\nMan this bitch is heavy\nYou gotta get under her armpits, man\nShut the fuck up, I got it\nWhat the, what the fuck did you guys do?\nIt was this nigga\nMe?\nShit, matter of fact you know what? You gon' dig the fuckin' hole this time\nI don't give a fuck, like it's the first fuckin' hole I ever dug\nWho the fuck is that?\nI don't know, ask fuckin' Charles Manson right here\nOh, oh, you're tryna be funny? You're really fuckin' tryna be funny right now?\nShh, shh, shut your ass up\nThis is bad. This is, this is fucking bad man.
