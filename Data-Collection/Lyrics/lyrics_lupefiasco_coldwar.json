I mean, everywhere\nI mean we just disappear and just come back\nI feel like we can just put him anywhere\nHe'd find his way back home, y'know'm saying\nAnother random thing's that consequence to me\nBut maybe to you, not much\nBut with that said, the reason behind me\nWhy I do what I does, love\nJust riding around bumping that, uh\nEither Jay or Nas, or me\nHe used to tell em like \"yeah you alright\"\nBut you ain't fucking with my man\nIt was always like that, so\nDrop a little for you, let it bump\nThis that Esco music, it's that Esco music\nBumping with my Esco music, that raw\nSee you on the other side, As-Salamu Alaykum", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/bf1d5066b005208868757d38c89ba9cc.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
