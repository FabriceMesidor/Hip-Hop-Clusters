Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That\u2019s my abstract take on what I know about it.\n\nSo I made the song \u201cNew Slaves.\u201d So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It\u2019s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?\n\n[...]\n\nIt looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I\u2019ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.\n\nIt\u2019s colorless also. It\u2019s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that\u2019s really what my style\u2019s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.\n\nMy dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he\u2019d get around Black people and they\u2019d kinda discriminate against him because they\u2019d say he acted \u2018white\u2019 or talked \u2018white.\u2019 So there are times when I\u2019ll talk and you\u2019ll hear some of that white--or what people call \u2018white\u2019--the suburb voice come through and it\u2019s times you\u2019ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I\u2019m influenced by all those things.\n\nI lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she\u2019s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn\u2019t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.\n\n[...]\n\nThere will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It\u2019s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it\u2019s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I\u2019m the only 36 year old me! I\u2019m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don\u2019t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.\n\n[Do you talk to corporations like that? They don\u2019t like being uncomfortable.]\n\nWe are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we\u2019re being a gated community doesn\u2019t mean that things are comfortable.\n\nThe thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we\u2019re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There\u2019s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.\n\nLike, politics is dead. It\u2019s over with. These kids need some type of real truth.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9fa6626ebb7cecda3ba692c1c80f52bf.1000x664x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
