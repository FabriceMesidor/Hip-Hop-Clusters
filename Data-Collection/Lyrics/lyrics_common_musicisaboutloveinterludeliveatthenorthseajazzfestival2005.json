What's on his mind?\nWhat's happening with the boy? What's the matter with the boy?\nIt's a problem with him. He used to be raw hip-hop when he first started\nNow he\u2019s changing on some other stuff. What\u2019s going on with dude?\nWhat's happening with him? Huh? What\u2019s the matter with Common now?\nLet me know, what's the matter with Common?\"\nThat's what they be saying, they hear the boy going crazy...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045767268a13a813bd7645f24fad7896.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
