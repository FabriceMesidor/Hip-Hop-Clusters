You better use your best foot\nFlawless freestyles I drop right off the top\nTake a bottle of beer and bite off the top\nRight of the block, straight to your neighbourhood\nThe flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good\nYo, check it out, it's Slim Shady\nI rip the radio right off of the S baby\nY'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it\nY'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it\nOriginal bad boy on the case, cover your face\nCame in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace\nI lace the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly\nEminem starts with E, better check the spellin'\nWith a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple\nI got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple\nSomebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure\nThat my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her\nI slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months\nAnd said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feeling these kicks, cunt?\nThe world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell\nI'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell\nI'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs\nAnd I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns\nI kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach\nAnd vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it\nHit you in the head with a brick till you plummet\nIf y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it\nAnd all the gibberish you were spittin', you need to kill it\n'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it\nAnd any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof\nAyo, bust it Proof!\n\n[Verse 2: Proof]\nOne of a kind and I come with the time\nHaving fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind\nListen, now every MC got a story\nWell mine is me and my story is an >\u2753\u2753< before me\nI'm sorry >\u2753\u2753< the style to be proved\nAyo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth\nYo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen\nWith a gat in holding, talking 'bout he DeShaun Holton\nIt's the same thing, we bust when it come through\nWith Tim Westwood, your best foot forward\nCan't do that, here it is, put your good foot\nWe mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood\nNo time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack\nWith a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps\nYou try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius\nA >\u2753\u2753<\nCome back holding my\u2015yo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)\nYo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest\nSlim Shady, next thing it was my fault\nY'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk\nWhile I settle for >\u2753\u2753<, it's the P-R-letter O\nSex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know\nHow you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow\nAnd my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine\nBag a scene, we drag your queen\nLike she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up\nLeft up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up\nYeah it's time for that mind combat\nNext up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nLast night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust\nAnd rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed\nShucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say\nI've called in to work cause all I do is frolic and play\nI swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day\nOf Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be\nGive me 11 Excedrin and my head will spin\nMedicine will get me reving like a 747 jet engine\nScratched my balls till I shred the skin\nDoctor check this rash, look how red it's been\nIt's probably AIDS, forget it then\nI'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows\nThat don't even make sense like dykes using dildos\nSo reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets\nAnd pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus\nSome'n some'n some'n some'n, I can't read it\nMy daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it\n\n[Verse 4: Proof]\nAyo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt\nMove the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt\nSo F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip\nThrough your collar disc, learn your knowledges\nThen burn your colleges, I touch your grill\nWith the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this\nAcknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker\nWhack rapper attacker, internet hacker\nNo slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket\nYeah you know about it, it's us on your jacket\nDJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?\nMake you go-go like Gadget, perform magic\nWithout a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam\nA vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground\nI'm still down y'all with my first crew\nYou got a fly style, I down that just like curfew\nYo I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention\nPlus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention\nListen to the real gift over ill riffs\nCause you on the mic, me and Em aren't tryna hear like Will Smith\nYour career's not over with, come here to cope a spit\nWe heat the sub y'all before the supernova hit\nI know the truth, so now I\u2019m baring all\nI make R. Kelly confess he stole his first style from Aaron Hall\nA whack MC with a gun, I'm not one\nAnd when see Kurt Cobain tell him \"bring back my shotgun\"\nI got one style for all y'all bazooka\nAyo if I was 2Pac I'd come back from Cuba\nRhyme with me when I push on her tooters\nTryna get wild and then we bust like Lugers\nMe and my man Slim Shady, we pen great-y\nTake our 80 MC's, West you know what, what\nWhat, what, what, what\nWhat\n\n[Verse 5: Eminem]\nYo yo yo\nOne more time I come back\nSlinging the wack, yo\nI'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners\nLooking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters\nI'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Senior\nAnd smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments\nI grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth\nWith a messed up childhood, that I use as an excuse\nAnd ain't nothing changed, I kept the same mindstate\nSince the third time that I failed 9th grade\nYou probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it\nI don't promote violence, I just encourage it\nI laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps\nAnd land inside a bed of spider webs\nSo throw caution to the wind, you and a friend\nCan jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again\nPfft, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out\nForget it, you only live once you might as well die now\n\n[Verse 6: Proof]\nYeah, best do like it is\nRoll your tape recorders, we came to the London borders\nWalk in a caster store, put on a master score\nBlast your four, then I trash your store\nYour woman start to scream so I stab your whore\nJet out your door faster than a Labrador\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 7: Eminem]\nSmoking herb and still we spit\nOn this microphone, they say I'm allowed to say 'shit'\nSo I'ma say it as much as I can\nCause it don't matter cause I'm the man\nWith a fricking beer in my hand\nI said frick cause I was respect to Tim Westwood\nY'all wanna step to this, yo I come from the best hood\nDetroit, the Motown, where it goes down\nKick the flow sound, rappers they know now\nBut kick a pro now\n\n[Verse 8: Proof]\nBack and forth, me and Em don't need to practice\nY'all lack this, we stick you like a cactus\nYou scream like a actress, the fact is\nY'all can't see us in '99, 2000\n3000, 4000 arousing styles\n\n[Verse 9: Eminem]\nAnd 3 plus, y'all wanna be us\nBut none of y'all can see us\nEven if y'all had some new bifocals, I try locals\nSo y'all die >\u2753\u2753< cause I smoke you\nPlus I provoke you and then I bust\nFreestyles y'all can't trust, I'm like Canibus\nI bust, can I bust?
