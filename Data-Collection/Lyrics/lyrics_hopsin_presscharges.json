I don't have to make no freakin' sense\nAnd only think I'm gettin over is your picket fence\nLast time we saw her was Saturday, She's been missing since!\nHmm, Maybe 'coz I stole her\nThat ho was bipolar\nI'm sick of skank ass bitches fuckin' my life over\nBut I dont hit girls, I sexually knock 'em up\nShe cheats on me, I chop her up\nFedEx come and box her up\nMe sayin \"Screw you, Don't call me again\" is not enough\nI'mma make you and your family suffer from alot of stuff\nDon't tell me to tone it down, motherfuckers, I gotta cuss\nWe'll never reunite, there's nothin' left I got for us\nWhat hurts the most is your family knew you were playin' me\nEverything we had was make believe\nI can't believe\nI fuckin' trusted you\nI shoulda never fucked with you\nNow you're gonna suffer the consequences, sucks for you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro talking]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec74857b2660ee45e3b1d2e79e99c58d.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
