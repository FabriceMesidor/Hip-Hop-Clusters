If I'm gonna... If I\u2019m gonna die or ever be a sacrifice, I want to make sure that my life made at least five million kids happy or they found some sort of answers or resolve in my life, regardless of the negative around my name, regardless of the bad things people say to me.\nI don't give a fuck, because I know my goal in the end and I know what I want for everyone, and I know what my message is.\nSo I just wanted to say I appreciate and love all of you and I believe in you all.\nDo not let your depression make you.\nDo not let your body define your soul.\nLet your soul define your body.\nYour mind is limitless.\nYou are worth...
