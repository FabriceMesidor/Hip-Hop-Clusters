Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store. But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nAlright stop, now before you walk in the door\nOf this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer\nYou better think of the consequence (But who are you?)\nI'm your mothafuckin' conscience!\n\n[Eminem]\nThat's nonsense\nGo in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs\nAnd borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs\nTell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days\nIf you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nYeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to\nThe whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you\nThink about it before you walk in the door first\nLook at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!\n\n[Eminem]\nFuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch\nCan you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?\nWhy you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?\nDo you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nMan don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)\nNot over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)\nDon't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you\n(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)\n\n[Hook]\nThese voices, these voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I follow, I follow\nI follow, I follow all these voices\n\n[Interlude: Mark Avery]\nMeet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]\nNow listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek\nAnd smearing her lipstick, slip this in her drink\nNow all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe\n(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old\nYou shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)\nYo, look at her bush, does it got hair?\nFuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare\n'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there\n(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie, Kids?)\nNo but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!\n(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)\nMan, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Mark Avery]\nMeet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]\nAlright, calm down, relax, start breathing\n(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating\nWhile you at work she's with some dude trying to get off\nFuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)\nWait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?\n(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)\nAlright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\n\n[Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]\nOkay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?\nGrab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?\n(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?\n(I'ma kill you, mothafucka!) Uhh-ahh, temper, temper\nMr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK\nComing straight outta Compton, y'all better make way\nHow in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nCause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?\nShoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
