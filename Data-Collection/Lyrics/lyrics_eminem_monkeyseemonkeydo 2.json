Wake up then make up\nFuck that! It\u2019s too late chump, now face up\nI pray for the day that someone who spits with the caliber that Nas and Jay does\nOpens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off\nOr rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off\nSo I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw\nAnd give him the surgery that he came for\n'Til I pull the paint off\nI never been shot\nBut I think me and Fifty must've been cut from the same cloth\n'Cause I\u2019ve always came off like Ja's chain\nWhen they try to rush him and lost\nAnd came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it\nI don\u2019t stop, only thing that I wait for\nIs the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court\n'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more\n'Cause I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw\nA lot of rappers on my list that just ain\u2019t Ja\nAnd I'ma read that motherfucker off come April\nYou pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile\nWhen I come back I\u2019ll be shooting more than just paintballs\nTrust me\n\n[Chorus]\nMonkey see, monkey do\nDon't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you\n'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do\nSo let them come to you, the rest'll just follow suit, monkey see, monkey do\nTweedle-dee, tweedle-dum\nIf they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come\nNow here they come as we expected, now we just set 'em up\nCheck-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won\nTweedle-dee, tweedle-dum\n\n[Outro]\nFucking dummies\nThis ain\u2019t chess\nYou playin' motherfucking checkers\nThis shit is all day, man, it\u2019s too easy\nWe playing chess, you playing checkers\nYou 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped\nFucking punks\nAnd by the way\nWe ain\u2019t just talking to one person\nWe talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it\n'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it\nSo bring it\nDon\u2019t pick up the ball if you don\u2019t wanna play, man\nIt\u2019s all fucked up now\nFuck I\u2019m supposed to do now?\nHuh?!\nWhat the fuck I'm supposed to do?!\nYo, we out!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8dd03ebbf724e2b4d4bafbddf8c3c2f1.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
