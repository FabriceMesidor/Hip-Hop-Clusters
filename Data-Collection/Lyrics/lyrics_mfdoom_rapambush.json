Rolled through, BRRRAT\nOld to the new, knows who holds the hat\nCustom tailored fitted, head stayed same size\nBig since first born, well spitted game wise\nSame guy, same disguise, sick aim eye stare\nAt thick dame thighs, click claim prize\nAnd the lucky contestant was sent\nA whole year's supply of buckets of yucky excrement\nDigital format, provide the ROM\nRide calm, flow was like a roadside bomb\nFlipped the Humvee, impact was limb-numbing\nCameraman wig back, gunner screaming INCOMING\nRPG, rhyme propelled grenade\nTime to yell, scramble for cover in the shade\nBright as the midday sun, then it fade\nDarkness come quick, some run and get sprayed\nRot dead, hot lead, it's rainin\nLeft 'em with they brains kicked in with they trainin\nDragged the remains into the open by the bootstraps\nDogtag attached to explosive human booby traps\nWhere's air support? Ears ringin, mortars whistlin\nBloodshot vision, afterthought: abort mission\nToo little too late, as the last man gush\nTook no prisoners mush, rap ambush\n\n(MURDALIZING SUCKER EMCEES~!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/01edf9d69a6ac635d7ca4d452539e8ce.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
