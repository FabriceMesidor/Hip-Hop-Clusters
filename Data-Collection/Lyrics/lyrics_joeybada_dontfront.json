learn, had to learn (had to learn)\nWe just had to burn, check\n\n[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]\nIt all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words\nI'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse\nShe played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls\nI cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all\nMine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times\nNot because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her\nOn the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her\nShe played the hustler and I'm like mad customers\nMan swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it\nBe blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted\nBut, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools\nThey say men lie and women lay naked, that's all foolin'\nNumbers don't matter after the first night\nRight, so what the fuck is love at its first sight\nIf you ask me, another stupid analogy\nMade to cover flaws in the female anatomy\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & CJ Fly]\nBut I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches\nDon't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)\nDon't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)\nI got some weed and some fronto (don't front)\nAnd you know I always hunt hoes\nI tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door\nNow don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)\nCheck (don't, don't, don't front)\n\n[Verse 2: CJ Fly]\nIt's like a massacre when mass occur\nI got a massive urge but I had to learn\nHeard you had it on lock so I pass the word\nI stash the herb, sit back observe\nThat she make me feel good is all I ask of her\nIn the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?\nI prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her\nI ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt\nLet's be blunt, we're best buds\nBoth knew our role this is more than just a crush\nI used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch\nBut now I rarely even see her\nIn everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up\nShe ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low\nAny time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe\nI thought I knew her better than anyone would know\nBagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her\nDidn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper\nWhenever I was with her, my mind would just relax\nCould've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and\nI admit it girl you fine as hell\nDon't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells\nYou tryna find her then follow her trail\nShe left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & CJ Fly]\nBut I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches\nDon't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)\nDon't front, don't front though (don't, don't, don't front)\nI got some weed and some fronto (don't front)\nAnd you know I always hunt hoes\nI tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door\nNow don't front (don't front) don't front (don't front)\nCheck (don't, don't, don't front)\n\n[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]\nAyo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription\nEmotionless positions and provocative visions\nShould've known you missed a note like the octave was switching\nRemember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches\nIt's a simulation yeah, stimulation\nTake off your shirt, let me feel manipulative\nMy heart like the Himalayas, but yeah, I gotta slay her\nI'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player\nSort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you\nAnd I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you\nSo, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual\nNothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable\n\n[Verse 4: CJ Fly]\nWe all try when you go bye, we all high\nTruth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies\nSo label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care\nI just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress\nIt put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me\nKept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath\nAlways kept the L so I know defeat\nSaid everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave\nNot sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre\nI was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma\nI'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark\nWhen it flooded, used to always feel like Noah\n\n[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]\nAnd I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her\nSo I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters\nCame back through and I put it in the holster\nJust had to teach her one time\nPut it down, don't really give a fuck though (don't front)\nAnd tell your bitch don't front though (don't front)\nDon't front (front, front, front, front)\n(Don't, don't, don't, don't front)\n\nCom sol e chuva\u2026", "image": "https://images.genius.com/252e8274d38f0d4a7ea351dd63231cbb.612x612x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
