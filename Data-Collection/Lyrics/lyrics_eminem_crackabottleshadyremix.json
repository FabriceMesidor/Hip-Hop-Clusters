Ladies and gentlemen\nThe moment you've all been waiting for\nIn this corner, weighing 175 pounds\nWith a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders\nThe undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world\nSlim Shady!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto\nO-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes\nNow, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust\nIt's on 'til the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\n\n[Interlude: Eminem]\n(Okay, let's go!)\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nBack with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk\nFix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust\nJust one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus\nKiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts\nIt disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks\nIt's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed\nBitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut\nFisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts\nNow picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought\n'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce\nIf I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time\nEvery verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes\nIt's elementary, the elephants have entered the room\nI venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true\nNot to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal\nOf the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto\nO-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes\nNow, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust\nIt's on 'til the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\n\n[Interlude: Ca$his]\nIt's Mister Shady\nCall for Ca$his\n\n[Verse 2: Ca$his]\nSix-four hoppers up at least four blocks\nI crank my watch like I don't see no cops\nRiding on a [?] six cars and [?]\nNo rims stop and stand up in the drop\n[?]\nI be chilling with the bitches, [?]\n[?]\nOn my L.A. pad rooftop, ha, ha\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto\nO-oh, o-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe\nGot one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes\nNow, where's the rubbers?
