flights\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nI live by the code, wardrobe from round the globe\nAll I need is a kilo, an apron - show me the stove\nGeneral Electric perfected, cooking them O\u2019s\nNo more peanut butter sandwiches now we looking at loaves\nHoes, I need a condom for my toast\nBusting in these niggas, standing flat footed, I\u2019m on my toes\nFroze, pandemonium overdose\nPaparazzi in the trees, please curtains closed\nArmadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf\nHeroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff\nPlaying for keeps, I bust in em fore she get off (HUH)\nI run the city just pull up and drop the kid off\nHah, welcome to organized crime\nMoney got me excited, I\u2019m coming four or five times\nThe .45 for you niggas with nine lives\nPenthouse on Collins, money long as Ocean drive (ah)\nBlack Chevy Tahoe\u2019s, Hatians up out the potholes\nMy place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos\nFeds get involved, I\u2019m slipping off into Senegal\nIssue your warrant, informant, bitch I\u2019ve been a boss\nCounting money stacks, yours' counter-fitted\nI made my money back when your accountant didn\u2019t\nWent against the odds, there's only one Rozay\n(M-M-Maybach Music) My nigga okay\n\n[Refrain-Rick Ross]\nI got a penny in my pocket (HUH), million in the trunk (HUH)\nStarted in the back, now we the niggas in the front (WHOO)\nStep out on the block all the bitches they still in shock (WHOO)\nGet a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop (HUH)\nPandemonium, causing pandemonium...rollin'...\nHalf a million for the same car we rolling in (AH)\nPandemonium, pandemonium\nWe the number one niggas your bitch noticing (HUH)\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nRollin', rollin', yeah\nMillion ways to make this money, you gon' get it\nOn the grind twenty-four/seven, I\u2019m with it\nYSL swagger, wrist wear frigid\nJumping out the Phantom like a muthafucking midget\nMoney knocking at the front door I\u2019m like, who is it\nIt\u2019s Benjy, tell my lil nigga go and get it\nCause I\u2019ve been counting all this dirty paper for a minute\nLamborghini dreaming thinking how I\u2019m gon' spend it\nI\u2019m like one\u2019s for the money, two\u2019s for the show of it\nThree\u2019s for the bitches that be fucking for the ho of it\nFour for my niggas that be stacking and then blowing it\nYou would think I had a curfew the way I\u2019m going in\nLook at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium\nPapi got them keys in, he like my custodian\nI was tryna bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon\nI was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it\nWe\u2019s part the reason that them Churches got some services\nThe morgue could afford just cause we was doing the murdering\nNigga called my phone talking reckless I ain't heard of it\nFuck your girl, give her back I\u2019m courteous\nI can keep a secret with Vicky have a menage with Nicki\nAnd be out London with Lauren and telling Megan Good morning\nCatch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris\nFrom Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear that I want em all\nWanna fuck em all\nHad my niggas down so I\u2019m screaming fuck the law\nMonday night wrestling, I\u2019m so fucking raw\nShe gon wipe me down, I\u2019ma brush her off\nI\u2019m way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak\nWord to the homie Ross I can get that nine piece\nFor the low that nine cheap, call me if you want it, haters see me\nAnd I'm stunting, got 'em sick to their stomach, ha\n\n[Refrain-Rick Ross]\nI got a penny in my pocket (HUH), million in the trunk

brag, bitch I got a right to boast\nPresidential suite and bitch, I never use my right to vote\nMy vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous\nAnd I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming\nShout out to lil g, shout out Tre and Mohammad\nThat BOA shit we get paid with death over dishonor\nI\u2019m known as Obama\u2019s though I know no-one in Congress\nThese bitches love me all the way, you got sorta\u2019s and kinda\u2019s\nSort of remind you, why you don\u2019t court no vagina\nJust give em awesome intercourse and ignore their inquires\nQuietly becoming a top tier\nYou dreamed of getting green, best believe I\u2019m John Deere\nGreenist Moncler shit, earth tones in the winter\nPurp rolled in a rillo, I am on my John Lithgow\nOut of this 3rd Rock, nigga air it out\nI am on my Tom Brady y\u2019all niggas is Eric Crouch\nWhat the bloodclot, Tommie Frazier fuck yourself\nI can't see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch\nHead for breakfast, fuck for lunch\nDinner time she bring a friend, write my shit so vicious\nY\u2019all are like snitches, you can\u2019t see the pen\nAlways on some new shit CNN\nShitting on these niggas like I need Depends\n\n[Refrain-Rick
