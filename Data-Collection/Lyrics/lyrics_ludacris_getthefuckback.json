the club, we comin' more than three deep\nYour whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters\nStayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers\nHow many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke\nInfamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke\nI gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way\nI'll push your wig back like finger weaves or bad toupee\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI lick a load of you niggas, leave kids in the hallways\nCatch 'em at they locka (hoo-ahh, blocka blocka)(gun shots)\nSee 'em on Broadway and tap they ass\nCatch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass\n\n[Verse 3: Fate Wilson]\nI'm from the southside, College Park\nG Road, niggas gone\nRide when the beef starts\nDon't hold back, let the heat spark\nOne's through his vest, bust through his chest\nSleepy hollows lay the niggas to rest, uh\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nLuda make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it

dat\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 4: Shawna]\nWhat you know about projects, hoes, and murda\nWhole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners\nWhole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers\nWhole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface\nType of bitch that got the brown in my sock\nFind me on tha block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop\nWatch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop\nBut if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the Glock, nigga\n\n[Verse 5: Ludacris]\nWe pop bottles, bottles, right over you head, niggas\nPut nozzles, nozzles, right over your leg, niggas\nOur motto, motto, is kill 'em instead, niggas\nWe make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas\n\n[Verse 6: I-20]\nAll of ya'll is half nice, half thugs, and half assed\nThe only time Im goin' half, is half on a half\nBut I use a full clip, cuz I'm a full fledged killa\nPart-time MC, full-time drug dealer\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nLuda make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die

that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Verse 7: Fate Wilson]\nWe them filthy niggas from the South, A-Town representas\nStrong armin' mafuckas, like a Russian sickle\nYou got issues with us talkin' shit on mixed tapes\nIll catch you at a show and beat you with a mixtape\nYou best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood oze\nI leave niggas like burps (burp), excuse\nJust keep on pissin' me off, like a weak kidney\nAnd you will find your family reading your obituary\n\n[Verse 8: Ludacris]\nThese people tryin' to scrub the red off\nStains they don't get off\nThey wanted to bring the pain, so this thang 'bout to set off\nBarretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off\nYes, you can do it, cut his fuckin' head off\n\n[Verse 9: Shawna]\nI got a letter from the government, the other day\nThey told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay\nThey on their way, three minutes to get the k\nTwo minutes to get the weight, one minute and I'mma spray\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nWe make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town's on my nutsack\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Chorus: Shawna]\nFuck That!\nGet the fuck back!\nWe make your skull crack\nTuck that\nBitch, your whole town better luh dat\nCuff that\nPut it in your weed, nigga, puff that\nWhat's that\nPeople gon' die tonight\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nBang bang kill a man let his brains hang\nAnd when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane\nThey put me in a ward, I'mma have to maintain\nBut when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change\n\n[Outro: Fate Wilson]\nBang bang kill a man let his brains hang\nAnd when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane\nThey put me in a ward,
