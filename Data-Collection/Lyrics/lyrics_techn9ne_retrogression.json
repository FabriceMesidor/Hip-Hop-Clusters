Can't we just reunite?\nI need a throwback to seeing you in flight\nYou had that down south body with a hint of death\nPicked you up and held you down, sound until I went to rest\nBut who needs rest, when the world is gone\nEverything is burning so I'mma just alert the globe and hurt you slow\nYou're known for fast love and vertigo, so I'll just\nPick you up and get a little intimate in a minute\nA cue for the return of a virgin soul\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Bernz]\nI tuned 'em out, I-I tuned 'em out\nToo busy turning on it dropping out\nBehind my, my mama's house, producing clouds\nNever understood my need to get numb\nMeanwhile I'm bleeding out my eyes\nHeaving out my lungs, trying to avoid the sun\nCurious at a young age for a taste, watching them numb they faced\nTill Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates\nI call it youthful curiosity, jumped the edge every saturday\nStrobe lights and low lifes the city at night was calling me\nI turned 'em out, I-I-I turned 'em out\nHad 'em both kissing on my lips\nThen smoked the spliff to boost the trip\nLift off, I'm gone, phone call my bro, let him know that I'm lost\nAnd I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach - Menage a Trois\nHeavily sedated I, grew up with jaded eyes\nSee she's been friends of mine since '99\nBut now we don't see eye to eye\nCan't retrogress, unless life gets too heavy for my chest\nThen I be tuning out and caning dropping out before they win", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4392f3223b9e5965e7f76dc529941352.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
