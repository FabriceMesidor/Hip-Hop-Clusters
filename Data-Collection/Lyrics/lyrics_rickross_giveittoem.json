(Give It To 'Em)\nKnow they kickin down your door just waving their four-four\nAin't thinking about the law\nOnly thing on they mind, is a little bit of shine\nAnd a couple stacks stashed up in your top drawers\n(so, Give It To 'Em)\nAnd they coming 'round the corner, 5 percent [?]\nChevy creepin' real slow, you know the routine\nDon't try to play Magiver\nSawed of shotgun pointin' out the window\n(so, Give It To 'Em)\nNot to mention them crooked cops\nPull you over when you drop\nOn the side of the road, take all your word\nPocket all your dough\nI ain't goin' thru none of that no more\nI have no choice but to win, cause I\nAbsolutely can't lose no way\n200 percent I am on my job\nGettin' money ain't nothin' left to say\nGet on your job with me, Get on your job with me\nReady for tomorrow if it ain't too late\nCause when them people come lookin for that money\nTell me man, what you gon' say\n(Give It To 'Em)\nNa na na..

When it come to gettin' paper better.. (Give It To 'Em)\nStarted at poverty now they call us the penticle\nTalkin' Bugatti I blow it all on a vehicle\nMillions in real-estate and the work that I administrate\nWhen I smoke in the whip, peel the top just to ventilate!\nAin't no palm trees in the ghetto, yeah it's cloudy weather\nBut we shinin' bright as ever!\nI refuse to lose in any game I choose to play\nUntil I die, I gotta get it in a major way\nAkon saved the day..\n[Akon:]I have no choice but to win, cause I\nAbsolutely can't lose no way\n200 percent I am on my job\nGettin' money ain't nothin' left to say\nGet on your job with me, Get on your job with me\nReady for tomorrow if it ain't too late\nCause when them people come lookin for that money\nTell me man, what you gon' say\n(Give It To 'Em)\nNa na na..
