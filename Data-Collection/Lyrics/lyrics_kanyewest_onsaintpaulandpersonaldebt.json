The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...\n\nHe was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...\n\nHe was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...\n\nPlease forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...\n\nAll memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...\n\nLet's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world\n\nI write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...\n\nThis is all all is fun all in good feelings... We will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!\n\nThey are calling me to the SNL stage now ... Speak soon...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9fa6626ebb7cecda3ba692c1c80f52bf.1000x664x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
