Up-front with his realness?\nThey wanna be fiascoes, reproduce his failures\nEmperor is his alias, but not Marcus Aurelius\nThis is more like Sparta: kick you down a well, kid\nAnd on my last check, I copped the NSX, just like Pharrell did\nWell did, better doings to come\nMy only promise is I'll never ruin the young\nI'll never human the sung lyrics in a spirit that's\nSuperhuman to some, keep you pursuing the sum of\nSlums, plus, get up out of them, plus, never forget\nJust where you from, plus, make sure that you're ballin'\nWhen you come back up in them, plus, we don't die, multiply\nEvery single come-up,  parum-pa-pum-pum, yup\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/519da23233c0aee9cd94e2ea433cf9d8.320x320x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
