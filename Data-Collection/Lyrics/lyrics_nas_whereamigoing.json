Where the hell am I?\nYo, it's ill...\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, my wife's tired of fucking me\nLife tries ducking me\nLuckily, I find 'em just at the right time\nMac in my right arm, tequila bottle in my left arm\nLike Christion, watching my life go\nCan\u00b4t do myself in\nWolves in the night yo, hell's men\nTwo revolvers, I can let 12 spin, hop in my Benz\nPush it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?\nMy Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience\nTelling me that I ain't shit\nNo matter how much cash I sit wit'\nStill gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness\nMy precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain\nTo replenish my adolescent brain\nBlessed be her name, before her birth, I was insane\nSo I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain\nI ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets\nTasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat\nThough I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive\nAs odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is\nTo maintain, bitches playin' games\nNiggas snitchin', I ain't saying names\nBut y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang\nLost so many close niggas\nDrunk, almost crashed, I'm going too fast\nHighway patrol will just flash\nLights in my rearview\nIf they stop me, I hope they lock me\nInstead they speed ahead\nYo, nigga, watch me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat\nI don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef\nI'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to\nPraying no car speeds by for me to crash to\nSteering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady\nAnything in my way is dead\n'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already\nWhen I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone\nDrunk by myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeard niggas hate me, but I hated too once\nBeen in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts\nFor every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves\nCan't tell these niggas nothing though\nBullets wake 'em up well\nTake 'em to hell\nStick up niggas once ran up on me\nMy decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me\nI ain't your mark, homie\nIt's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake\nSpilling my bottle, not even shook of the Jakes\nCould hardly look both ways\nPut out the haze, blurry vision\nThink about the time in my life before I was in television\nHella women, jealous niggas up in my vision\nSince we all hood niggas, expect kilos\nBut what they not seeing is police expect RICO\nOnly if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated\nWindows up, blastin' A.C., going wherever instinct takes me\nI hate it when I'm like this\nThe bottle's my accomplice\n\n[Hook]\nI'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat\nI don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef\nYo, I'll ride to the end of the road, if I have to\nPraying no car speeds by for me to crash to\nSteering wheel in my hand, I try to hold it steady\nAnything in my way is dead\n'Cause that's the way I feel I am already\nWhen I'm drunk by myself, alone in the zone\nDrunk by myself\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe reason that I want to be alone\nTired of all the things that went wrong\nThat would have went right if I would have did it on my own\nTake another swig\nThe more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts\nFake friends who hung around, who wanna bring you down\nNot knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through\nSupposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true\nOr what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately\nChoosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again\nTo keep my mind off that weak shit\nThere's love through it all\nThings to live for\nI swerve, almost crash into a wall\nThink about the good, find myself laughing\nTurn the cell off, no way to be reached\nKnow I'm near my crib\nTryna see my way through the streets\nReminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home\nStart to feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip\nBring my ass to the crib, I'm tired...\n\n[Hook]\nI'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat\nI don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef\nI'ma ride to the end of the road if I have to\nPraying no car speeds by for me to crash to\nSteering wheel in my hand, trying to hold it steady\nAnything in my way is dead\n'Cause that's the way I feel, I am already\nWhen I'm drunk by myself, all alone in the zone\nDrunk by myself", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ddeb1a53a0fc7efb22da29a93c9384a7.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
