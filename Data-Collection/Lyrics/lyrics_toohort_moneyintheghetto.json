Havin money in the ghettooo\n\n[Verse Two]\nMoney in the ghetto ain't nothin new\nIt's been like that, way before you\nWas even born, get up from the down stroke\nChocolate City for the black folks\nSay it loud in ya hot pants\nMan child in the promised land\nI take you back to Iceberg Slim\nAnd all the players that came before him\nIf you a everyday hustler, get your money\nCause what they do to black man ain't funny\nAll the time tryin to put us the pen\nYou get paroled and then they send you again\nAll the homies in the hood gettin paid\nYou might have left but the money stayed\nIn the ghetto, it ain't all about drugs\nGettin paid doin all kinds of stuff\nOnly rule on the streets is don't get caught\nUnless your hustle ain't breakin the law\nAnd even though rich folks got it good\nWe sittin on 'em fat in the hood\nI'm ridin on some gold ones\nSmokin dank and it's potent\nAsk them fools, cause they know\nThere's money in the ghetto\n\nChorus One\n\n[Verse Three]\nI got money baby, just tell me the price\nCause Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice\nI always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin\nSpend fo', get an ounce of dank then\nRich nigga get high relaxin\nIf I bust a Ben Frank' get some Andrew Jacksons\nFive twenties for a hundred dollar bill\nYou know the math, let's make a deal\nOn the one dollar bill if you look on the front\nYou find the face of George Washington\nMake money baby, that's all I do\nThat's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two\nAbraham Lincoln got shot and died\nFreed the slaves so they put him on the five\nAnd Hamilton, my old time friend\nThey put his face on the front of the ten\nThese are the dead presidents\nFrom the hood and they represent\nThe American dream for the average minority\nMake your money, get some weed and a forty\nI'm on the Eastside livin' like a king\nKick back watchin fifty-inch screens\nBounce to the Westside, hit the studio\nAnd spend my money in the ghetto\n\n[Hook Two]\nHey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (They got money in the ghetto)\nHollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo\n\n[Verse Four]\nNowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports\nYou might just come up short\nAnd they always say the same things\nDon't be a gangster or a dopefiend\nGet your high school diploma, go to college\nGet a degree and start makin' dollars\nOnly one thing wrong, and it's a Trip\nInner city schools don't teach us shit\nGot us stuck on stupid, Straight S.O.S\nCan't get nothin, but they payin the rest\nOf them fools\nAll Around the world in the other countries\nThey should be spendin that money right here\nIn the state of California\nYou graduate and can't spell \"diploma\"\nDip to the hood and get rich\nSlangin rocks to a smoked-out bitch\nNo school'll come close to that\nA few transaction make my pockets fat\nI make a lot of money and it ain't no lie\nI'll probably ball 'til the day I die\nAnd if I didn't, so what?\nI bet you I'd still come up\nCause there's a whole lot of money in the ghetto.. yeah you know\n\nChorus Two", "image": "https://images.genius.com/21510ed0098aea2435f06f15ce7d2b68.384x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
