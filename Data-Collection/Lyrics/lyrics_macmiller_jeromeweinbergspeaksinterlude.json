I know, hes the rapper who gets all the ladies, and hes the that popular guy\nBut do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana?\nIs that safe for your environment here at school?\nI've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those... Dutch masters in the stalls\nAnd that is not cool\nSo vote for me and not for weed\nThank you\nAgain Jerome Weinberg", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4186ee36b844bd7bbde71da3b370390b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
