Further I could go into\nBut what for? We're already killing them\nWe're like Williams and Woods on tour\nNow that's love above par, ooh\nI just love to love ya'll, you're my power\nMy peace, my elegant flowers\nNo matter what the world is coming to\nI take the rap, they got nothin' on\u2026you\n\n[Lupe Talking Over Hook]\nHeh..you know what I'm sayin'?\nI mean, temptation is a mother\nBut you're like none other\nThey can't compare\n's why I'm here, you know?\nIt's like FOR-ever, that's like a long time (haha)\nYeah, the vibrations are very nice on this one\nLupe, let's go\u2026PEACE!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6064ad68b3a05d49650aa973fff2bff4.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
