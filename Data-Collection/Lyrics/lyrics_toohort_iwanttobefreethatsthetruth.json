(and that's the truth) Ohhh yeahhh\nI want to be free! Ohhh yeahhh\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI be in Oakland California every day of my life\nBass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe\nAnd if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind\nSearched all my stuff, and all you find\nIs a pocket full of money count seven G's\nNow you wanna think I'm sellin keys\nCause I'm a black man, but I run my own business\nSo why the police wanna send me to prison\nThey see a brother makin major cash\nThey knock a patch out his black ass\nAnd that's the truth, you can't argue you at all\nTryin to give you ten years for a phone call\nAin't even trippin on the dank smoke\nCause all they wanna find, is guns and coke\nIn court all the time tryin to fight it\nWe get rich, we get indeibted\nSo what's the problem Officer this time?\nIs havin' big money being black a crime?\nOr did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson\nCharge me with somethin, or just ask questions\nAbout the brothers I hang around\nWhat's really goin on in the Oakland town\nTell me who went broke, and who got rich\nBut Too $hort baby just ain't no snitch\nYou say you're just doin your job\nBut you're gettin on my nerves, just like Bob\nEverytime I hit a corner, I see you\nAlways tellin brothers what to do\nYou lock me up cause I don't know how to act\nBut I'm down for mine so I be talkin back\nAnd when I do, you treat me bad as hell\nI'm sick of spendin nights in jail\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nGot out of jail about fo'-fifteen\nWalkin down the street like a broke dopefiend\nHad a pocket full of money tryin to play the role\nBenz got towed and I was hella cold\nBut I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now\nHandcuffed your boy took me straight downtown\nFor three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later\nCause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa\nFor no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong\nYou think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song\nWell I'm a black man, ridin in a Benz\nHow in the hell did I make these ends? Here we go\nI pull over to the right\nStop the engine keep my hands in sight\nI start cursin, cause it don't make sense\nWhy would I run and try to jump a fence\nIf I was plannin, a smooth getaway\nI never woulda stopped in the first place\nYou'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't\nCause all I got on me is a big fat bank\nAnd I hope I don't get robbed by you know who\nMake me donate some G's to the boys in blue\nAnd if I sue, I won't get nothin back\nBut I ain't mad... I'm just black...\n\n[Hook: 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f82c145afb5d000ecf7dbe3e66f99782.1000x992x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
