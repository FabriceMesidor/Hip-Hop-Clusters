Rescue all your babies\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby\n\n[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nNot gonna go crazy when I blow up\nBet they gonna go crazy when I show up\nWon't listen to the haters cause I know what\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nSaid I gonna be slow if I pour up\nBut I'm gonna be poor if I slow up\nSo I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nTryna get the tour bus with the studio\nIt ain't no buts, just bootyholes (uh)\nCan't be out here looking like dookie\nWhen you're tryna start a movement and come up on a movie role\nEverything's polished\nI ain't go to college, I was at the conference\nChopping with the DJs, tryna give my single on replay\nAnd shit up on the game like colonics (colonics)\nHold the phone, take a flick with a fan for me (click)\nHit the strips with a brick of the dance money (strip)\nI'm tired, let's switch with the van for me\nWhen I make it by, you'll print the advance money\n\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby\n\n[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nNot gonna go crazy when I blow up\nBet they gonna go crazy when I show up\nWon't listen to the haters cause I know what\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nSaid I'm gonna be slow if I pour up\nBut I'm gonna be poor if I slow up\nSo I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here\n\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nHold up, light man, turn the lights on\nCame a long way from when I was holding the mic wrong\nSomething for the hood and a whole lot of white songs\nLike I evolved to a whole 'nother life form\nI'm just tryna make it happen, don't attack that please\nCan't find a job, you can rap at least\nCause that's what I did, I was at that league\nRight out of high school, tryna stack that cheese\nYou was tryna do what? Tryna stack that cheese\nYou wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese\nMake American singles, wanna stack that cheese\nMake everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese\nTryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese\nTalking frequent flyer miles how I stack that cheese\nTryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese\nAye Stack, can we stack that please?\n\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me? Rescue all your babies\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me? I am just a baby\n\n[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nNot gonna go crazy when I blow up\nBet they gonna go crazy when I show up\nWon't listen to the haters cause I know what\nSaid I'm gonna be a rapper when I grow up\nSaid I'm gonna be slow if I pour up\nBut I'm gonna be poor if I slow up\nSo I gotta keep it going, ain't no slow motion in here\n\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]\nWho, who, who (ay)\nHip-Hop, won't you save me?
