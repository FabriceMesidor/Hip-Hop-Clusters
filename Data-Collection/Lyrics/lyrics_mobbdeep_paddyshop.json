Son, they want to take my life!\nI'm paranoid, damn sure ain't the weed I smoke\nIt's the phony mother fuckers, while I'm on, they're broke\nI see 'em starin', with their heat to try to get bold\nStarin' at my gold, so the heat I hold tight like a mic\nWhen I rhyme, commit crimes tonight\nThrew a bid on my head? Pump lead\nLeave your whole town red, bust a vessel instead\nI choose, you lose when I squeeze\nThe enemies, them blow to fumes\nSpark a L, burn a brain cell, love love\nAy black, Paddyshop, light it up\n\n[Bridge: Big Noyd]\nBig Noyd in the house, representin' Mobb Deep\nEither smokin' a black or the bluey one-twoey\nLightin' it up, light the weed and make a cloud (x4)\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nYou got a lot of heart boy, all that yappin'\nActin' like it can\u2019t happen\nIt\u2019s brothers like you who fail to realize the realness\nSo, now I got to deal with this\nBack when I was younger, I used to get stuck\nBut now the tables turned and I make the beef duck\nQuit stealin' all you who want to try and play me\nI bet you if I hit you with the pound you\u2019d obey me\nYou must be smokin' dust, my crew will flip for days\nAnd bust your face open in various ways\nI\u2019m in too deep, ain't no if, what if, maybes\nAnd if you got a kid then the P is killin' babies\nAnd after that, relax and get puffed out\nBut watch your step 'cause you could still get rubbed out\nStop frontin', get a Tec to your grill\nFor real, you ain\u2019t ill, I know the deal\nPuff a fat L, burn a brain cell, love love\nAy black, Paddyshop, lightin' it up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Havoc]\nI leave your brain in a faze, call me, dead\nYour mind can\u2019t find out project side, that\u2019s when I climb out\nBe on a flow in the Ac, the two, either one, two\nAy Black, that\u2019s where they got that stay high\nKeep my mind in the sky, straight are the corrupt\nFront on this kid and you get bucked\nLeft stuck off the raps I kick, Queensbridge kid, you dig?\nAnd rocks into the head, take a swig\nI\u2019m bent, stay hard, and if we bump into any shorties\nAll I want to know is if there\u2019s any skins to barb\nI live the high life, keep my mind right, do my dirt at night\nForget the pull, word is bond, it\u2019s on\nQueensbridge representin' with the automatic fullies\nWeapons we pack, more cracks and flip G-packs\nGet that loot kid, what you gonna do\nWhen my whole crew is blazin' at you?\n\u2019Cause it\u2019s whole crews we run through\nI'm ill like Tommy Hill but brothers can\u2019t figure the facts\nFake Jacks, you\u2019ll get ten in your back\nI react like a maniac, strapped with macs\nIt\u2019s what the petty tip you on cause I'm not on it like that\nI just chill, what the Hell?
