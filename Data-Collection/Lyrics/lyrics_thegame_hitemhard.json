bitch bad, I get racks\nThat Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped\nThem birds still come shrink-wrapped\nI'm not strapped, don't think that\nI'm low key with that click clack\nThat rat a tat tat tat tat\nThrow the burner and I'm runnin' home\nNiggas stop being loyal when the money gone\nStill walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong\nOne chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on\nLook at my flow on this bitch\nPlatinum and gold on my wrist\nMoney, the accountant be countin' it\nThat's why I'm throwin' this shit\nI'm in BK with that SK\nSame clothes since yesterday\nWith that Biggie Smalls on replay\nAnd I ain\u2019t wearing no vest today\nI do the Shmoney dance with this mac\nYou better do it too or get Shmurda\u2019d\nI be grilling that beef, I ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 no burgers\nI finna be walkin\u2019 like I\u2019m a New Yorker\nI let off the K and then I hop in the Uber\nIt\u2019s never a question that I am the shooter\nI empty the clip and lay you in a pool of\nBlood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?\nBlood, bandana that\u2019s how we be movin\u2019\nBlood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn\nAnd this ain\u2019t the Barclays but niggas be shootin\u2019\n\n[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]\nRunning niggas down back and forth, I\u2019m like \"Pass the torch\"\nBlast it off, niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard\nRunning niggas down back and forth, I\u2019m like \"Pass the torch\"\nBlast it off, niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard\n\n[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]\nRunning cocaina back and forth, copped the bag of salt\nE-S to the G-N, I\u2019m the boss dropped the package off\nComing for the murder, masks is off, bitch you took a loss\nFuck the DEA, we shook \u2018em off, bitch we shook \u2018em off\nShook and twist the jars\nAnd dope on my momma's stove top\nBy the time she came back from church boy\nI bet you I had an O stocked\nIn the middle of the muh'fuckin' day\nNo more yayo, boy I done sold out\nNigga pull up in a mothafuckin\u2019 foreign\nOn forgies that\u2019ll bring them hoes out\nLike yeah nigga, niggas keep beggin\u2019\nI pull out a pump in this bitch like I\u2019m blizzard\nYeah, empty your pockets, we robbin\u2019\nThese bitches, got all of 'em strippin'\nNigga, it\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission\nYou catchin\u2019 the hollow, I\u2019m catchin\u2019 you slippin'\nI did it alone, only God as my witness\nMy nigga got off cause we tied up the witness\nAnd made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court\nYou know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin'\nThem niggas gon' be at your throat\nEveryday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin'\nWith two twenty-three at your door\nFlippin' a check off this rappin'\nGo back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like\n\n[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]\nRunning niggas down back and forth, I\u2019m like \"Pass the torch\"\nBlast it off, niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off?\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all, we gon\u2019 hit

hit 'em all\nFirst to score, we gon\u2019 hit 'em all, we gon\u2019 hit 'em hard\n\n[Verse 3: Skeme]\nI just caught a body like a week ago\nThese hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though\nYou talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro\nWe pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European boom!\nS to the K to the E-M-E\nCallin' the EMT after I empted this clip\nI sold my dope right on CMT\nI'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets\nChuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters\nSo I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits\nRolley on wrist, no tock or no tick\nYour girl on my dick, man come get your bitch\nNiggas think this a rap now\nI might back down and come try your luck\nRiders with me be wired up\nThey ridin' with me 'til the tires bust\nHaters talkin' but they better cool it\nBefore that nigga Crooked get fired up\nLay you out like my Balmains\nYou gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up\nDrinkin' lean 'til I'm high enough\nI don't give a fuck about nan nigga\nI ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off\nI just handle mine like a man nigga\nI'm on frontline with these bands nigga\nNeed a chair, I can't stand niggas\nWe do walk-by's and hop outs\nGot slidin' doors on that van nigga\n\n[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]\nRunning niggas down back and forth, I\u2019m like \"Pass the torch\"\nBlast it off, niggas making bets so who gonna blast him
