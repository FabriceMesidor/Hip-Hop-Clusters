Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\n[Verse 1]\nDo you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?\nCould I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?\nIs your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?\nWould you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?\nIf I\u2019m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off\nIf the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car\nWould you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?\nOr question my character and degrade me on every blog?\nWant you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson\nI freed you from being a slave in your mind, you\u2019re very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it\u2019s surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain\u2019t a prophet til they ask you this question:\n\n[Refrain 2]\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThe ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'\nLet my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message\nAs I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd with that\u2014\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you believe in me? How much you believe in her?\nYou think she gon\u2019 stick around if them 25 years occur?\nYou think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?\nYou think y\u2019all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?\nEven though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?\nLike, who got your best interest?\nLike ,how much are you dependent?\nHow clutch are the people that say they love you?\nAnd who pretending?\nHow tough is your skin when they turn you in?\nDo you show forgiveness?\nWhat brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?\nWhat kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?\nWhat kind of bridge did they burn?\nRevenge or your mind when it\u2019s mentioned\nYou wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson\nYou wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom\nYou wanna be remembered that delivered the message\nThat considered the blessing of everyone\nThis your lesson for everyone, say;\n\n[Refrain 2]\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\n[Chorus 3]\nThe voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'\nLet my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message\nAs I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd if you riding with me, nigga\u2014\n\n[Verse 3]\nI been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues\nI hold grudges like bad judges, don\u2019t let me resent you\nThat\u2019s not Nelson-like\u2014want you to love me like Nelson\nI went to Robben\u2019s Island analysing; that\u2019s where his cell is\nSo I could find clarity\u2014like, how much you cherish me?\nIs this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?\nSee I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs\nTrees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy\u2019s Law\nGeneration X\u2014will I ever be your ex?\nFlaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit\u2014pause\nPut me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y\u2019all\nIt\u2019s respect\u2014but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall\nHow many leaders you said you needed then left \u2018em for dead?\nIs it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?\nIs it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter\u2014you assassin\nIs it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it\u2019s Michael Jackson\u2014oh\n\n[Refrain 3]\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nThat nigga gave us \"Billie Jean,\" you say he

lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga\n\n[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar & 2Pac]\n\"I remember you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn\u2019t wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn\u2019t stop survivor\u2019s guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m no mortal man\nMaybe I\u2019m just another nigga\u201d\nShit and that\u2019s all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain\u2019t really a poem\nI just felt like it\u2019s something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\n\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat\u2019s how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I\u2019m saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\n\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that\u2019s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\n\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin\u2019, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it\u2019s time to make millions for myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\n\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\n\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I\u2019m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it\u2019s no problem, you know\nI mean, it\u2019s a problem but I\u2019m not finna let them know\nI\u2019m finna go straight through\n\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\n\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I\u2019ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it\u2019s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s in my veins to fight back\n\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I\u2019m fighting a war I can\u2019t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\n\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that\u2019s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it\u2019s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don\u2019t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, you can look around\nYou don\u2019t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\n\nThat\u2019s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere\u2019s nothing but turmoil goin\u2019 on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don\u2019t think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it\u2019s gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain\u2019t gonna be no playing\nIt\u2019s gonna be murder, you know what I\u2019m saying?\nIt\u2019s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s gonna happen\n\nThat\u2019s crazy man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don\u2019t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don\u2019t know what type of energy I\u2019ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it's spirits, we ain\u2019t even really rappin\u2019\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt\u2019s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac? Pac? Pac?!\n\n[Produced by Sounwave]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c45787f8bcd449a46bc3d1b50e65cc8.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
