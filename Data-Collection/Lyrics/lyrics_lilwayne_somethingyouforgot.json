BANG!\n\n[Hook]\nYou've been hiding, never letting it show\nAlways trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)\nYou got it down, and you're well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)\nBut there is something that you forgot\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring\nI remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing\nI remember the love, right after the fights\nYou can't tell me you don't remember those nights\nAnd if I would cry, then you would cry twice\nTo me you are the brightest star under sunlight\nSee take away my title, take away my stripes\nYou give me back my girl and you give me back my life\nGive me back my girl and you give me back my life\nSee this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice\nOpen up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight\nI remember the time, I wish I could bring it back\nWhat she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)\n\n[Hook]\nYou've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show\nAlways trying (I see you hidin' it mama)\nTo keep it under control (but I know you know)\nYou got it down (I know you do)\nAnd you're well on your way to the top\n(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)\n\n[Verse 3]\nBut I hope you haven't forgot about me\nUp in the livin' room watchin' SportsCenter\nYou were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner\nBut the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray\nThen you can get your blessings ordered and delivered\nAnd your boyfriend is not like me\nMa, you even went and got a teardrop like me\nI remember we would sit at home all day\nYou called me \"butta,\" I called you \"bae\"\nMy momma asked about you, my partners did too\nI know your daughter will be so amazin' like you\nAnd I know you probably wish you never met me\nAnd I just wish you never forget me, and let me say\nPlease don't worry 'bout the women I have been with\nNo engagement can amount to your friendship\nAnd I hope that nigga know he got a queen\nAnd all I can do is dream, damn\n\n[Hook]\nI've been lonely, I've been waiting for you\nI'm pretending, and that's all I can do\nThe love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58abe7b35759cd5e876b36af76e0b072.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
