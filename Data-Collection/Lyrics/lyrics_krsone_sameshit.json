I spit the same swing\nDing ding ding, there goes the bell\nI'm the same as heaven, these dudes the same as hell\nI'm the same as the plane at liftoff, fly\nThey the same as a rip-off, a lie\nI remind you\nDon't let the criminal mind blind you\nInstead let the spiritual mind find you\nSee I'm you\nJust twenty years ahead\nIts to your advantage to hear KRS-ONE and rewind what he said\nIts the same shit\n\n[Bridge]\nIts the same shit\nLook\n\n[Verse 3]\nDrug cartels is what sells the medical\nDrug spots and drug stores are identical\nY'all need to wake up and join with the woke folk\nIgnorance is only gonna keep you with them broke folk\nKRS is on some cool shit\nI ain't nothing to fool with\nI teach more kids than the school gets\nGame over, stupid\nIts like we at the eight ball corner pocket\nAnd I got the pool stick\nYou can say whatever, me I'm living better and better\nGetting cheddar, out in Greece getting the feta\nUp in Catalonia only eating paella\nUp in Italy getting bread, call it bruscetta\nI spit\nThey cruise cars, I cruise ships\nDemocrat and Republican, that's the same shit\nIts the same shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7b1daf2ed6f9ee66a79dbc610af91d7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
