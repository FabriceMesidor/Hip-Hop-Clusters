Funky motherfucking fresh\nSome of that '93 old school shit, ho\n\nWell I'm Too $hort baby, hear what I say\nI never do work but I always play\nCause the game is life and I play the game\nSo you never talk down on a player's name\nWhen I grab my mic I'm the one man crew\nTalking bout me, wouldn't think about you\nWhen you heard Too $hort came to town\nYou never would've thought I'd be looking down\nOn who? On you cause I'm so big\nMe and my money is all I dig\nI'm from the Dangerous Crew, we ain't no punk\nWe take 24 tracks, drop the funk on your ass\nBeating like a dope fiend\nBack seat riding in a limosine\nTelling that freak all about me\nThe creater of greater, sucker MC's\nChilling out in the Oaktown singing a rap\nNo MC could rock like that\nNow I say it like bitches say\nNo MC could rock my way\nWhen I rap it's always great\nWouldn't care if it was like or on a tape\nIt's me, $hort, the one and only\nSpitting that rap to all my homies\nYou know about you, you know I'm a star\nWhen I rap too good I might take it too far\nHad the whole damn crowd going wild\nCause I don't stop rapping, that's my style\nToo $hort baby from East Oakland\nI got more hoes than I can count on my hand\nYou got women? Well I got more\nYou don't know? Shit, I'm Playboy $hort\nThey call me \"Playboy $hort\" known everywhere\nHad a life long dream to be a player\nWay too cold at a younger age\nIt was every day, just make that page\nStill playing the same, still young at the game\nNever talk down on a player's name\nCause I'm big time, paid all my dues\nI'm rich and famous and way too cool\nPeople can't fuck with the way I'm rhyming\nThey say it's too slow but it bought these diamonds\nToo $hort baby is the name I use\nA '93 Lexus is what I cruise\nClean from the start, I thought I was it\nI was Cadillac Slick in the dust I kick\nBut the Caddy got parked cause I'm riding new\nEastside bitch, so I'm siding, fool\nMoney everywhere, all over the floor\nAt the bank I'm known as \"Mr. $hort\"\nAt the house I be chilling, getting some head\nWriting raps all day, even in bed\nAnd them groupie-ass bitches love this shit\nThe funk rap master, made to fit\nJust her, I'm all in them guts\nHomeboy can't fuck so I hooked it up\nBut young women like you with your big round butts\nBlind girls driving down the street called \"Love\"\nChasing that man, who really can't stand\nSeeing your face so now you ran\nAnd you don't realize what you'll soon see\nThe way making love is supposed to be\nWith a player known as Playboy Too\nRock a mic and a freak and you'll both be through\nPlayers play women who like to get played\nBitched like you just trying to get laid\nBut I like money, and I get paid\nI do my duty and say \"Good day\"\nI didn't want to make love, I'm not that fast\nWhat the hell, she's a freak, she even asked\nSo let's go to my room, after the show\nTreat me like a pimp, and pay me ho\nYou can suck my dick and I might sing\nJust love Too $hort, I'm everything\nSo cool, my name is \"Too\"\nCall it how you want but I won't call you\nRing my phone and you might see\nRinging my phone just won't get me\nCause I'm hard to find, and I get mine\nAnd if I was looking for you, I wouldn't be in line\nI'd be right on time in the right place\nToo $hort baby all in your face\nTalking bout mine and what I want\nFucking MC's with the Dangerous funk\nI'm on my way, to the top\nSo much rapping I'll never stop\nAnd all that fame, you might claim\nCouldn't stand up by my rap name\nYou might be good, I don't care\nI've been rapping like this 13 long years\nI got more respect then you'll ever get\nCause I don't stop rapping and you know that shit\nSucker MC's with your record deal\nMost tapes out now couldn't be real\nCause your tracks ain't shit, dreaming bout hits\nBut you'll find out Too $hort don't quit\nWhen I grab my mic I'm the one man crew\nTalking bout me, wouldn't think about you\nWhen you heard Too $hort came to town\nYou never would've thought I'd be looking down...
