Should I blast myself?\nI'm tired of bein' broke, and even worse\nThe upper class act like they don't want me on this earth\nThis life will drive you crazy \u2013 only if you allow it\nThat's only if you a coward, and you're sure to get devoured\nTo no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power\nWho's gonna take a stand? Who's gonna be a man?\nWho do you work for? Please help me understand!\nYou could be the victor in this situation\nWe may die individually, but as a nation\nWe'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga\nBreak ties from the everyday lies, nigga\nIt's our time, until it's our time\n\n[Hook: Ash Riser]\nDon't be so afraid to die\nUntil it's our time\nDon't be so afraid to die\nIt's our time, 'til it's our time\n\u2018Cause we'll never die\n\n[Verse 3: Punch]\nPardon my immortality\nI'm Martin Luther shootin' back on the balcony\nEscapin' the Lorraine until they call in the cavalry\nAlpha 184, oh Lord, nobody blast for me\nIf it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther\nNigga, show me to the slaughter\nI gladly sacrifice what is percieved\nSow my seed, so my seed can live its dreams\nMy spittin' image, see my stitchin' in his genes\nAccordin' to my likeness, his breath of life is priceless\nMy enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans\nPenetratin' America's culture to its very being\nIt's not political, it's more critical\nSpiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical\nBut I advise y'all to keep me alive\nIn the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life\nBeautiful death, nigga!\n\n[Bridge: Ab-Soul]\nTragedy after tragedy, I know it's sad to see\nAmerica killin' her babies like Casey Anthony\nWe try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity\nPoppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy\nWe travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace\nWe promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece\nPut down your piece!\nI wish you all a beautiful death \u2014 peace!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36147c3e9b6fcfa747233bb1c340f424.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
