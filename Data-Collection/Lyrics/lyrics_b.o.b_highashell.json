Kelly, I think I can fly\nBut this is as high as it go\nI can't recall being sober\nCause that was a trillion hours ago\nYou say you want to get higher than me\nWell you got a billion miles to go\nNigga this stone age, roll up and put it in rotation\nMy dro potent and make show faces\nTill I'm po' baby like an old lady\nSo faded like some old navy in an old basement\nWith my OG that's fresh off of probation\nI bang, bang, you be ho saving\nRan in yo ho like home invasion\nWhen I hit up my dealer I'm so impatient\nI be hightailing and ain't no debating\nI know the answer to the whole equation\nAlways baking like a local bakery\nWe pass it around like a roller skating rink\nI go to the club, it stay open late for me\nJust rolled up a blunt and it's motivating me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nWoke up in the morning, grab some weed, a joint and rolled it\nPut some cheese eggs on my stomach, I don't need it bitch I want it\nCrib in California, got a villa in the trump\nI put some converse on my feet and told my bitch, \"let's get this money\"\nOne joint, fourteen grams, that's a half\nBlow torch on the nail, that's a dab\nSpace cakes, Hemp2O, I'm getting blow\nBudder in a G-Pen, man I'm stoned\nOne hit of this wax, got him high, he don't wanna say it\nTry to call my phone, but I'm gone, me and Bobby Ray\nI'm smoking Kush today, tomorrow, I'm a straight shatter\nHardcore budder, lookin' like some cake batter\nIt make me think better, fucking up you're dead wrong\nRasta told me \"fat rips make the dread long\"\nI took a dab, past out fly as hell\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: B.o.B.]\nHigh, in the sky, Superman\nAm I high, yes I am\nI done lost my mind (4x)\nIn the sky, ceiling fan\nPurple haze, Afghanistan\nI done lost my mind (4x)\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/948c819840b00c4b4f105bbc7336ecdd.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
