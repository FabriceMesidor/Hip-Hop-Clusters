So if I said I never did drugs\nThat would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does\nHilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert\nI ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet\nMy nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge\nGrabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads\nEvery girl I ever went out with has gone les'\nFollow me and do exactly what the song says\nSmoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people\nAnd drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal\nI'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal\nSo I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill\nSome people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill\n\u2018Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill\nBut I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist\nHow the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist\nI get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave\nDie from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave\nMy middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?\nAnd this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?\n\n[Hook 1]\nNow follow me and do exactly what you see\nDon't you wanna grow up to be just like me?\nI slap women and eat shrooms then OD\nNow don't you want to grow up to be just like me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMe and Marcus Allen was buttfuckin' Nicole\nWhen we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold\nJumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold\nKilled them both then smeared blood on the white Bronco\nMy mind won't work if my spine don't jerk\nI slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt\nI'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer\nThat'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer\nMy rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue\nWith your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch\nJumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on\nAnd beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn\nI'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates\nWith deformative traits, a premature birth that was four minutes late\nMother, are you there? I love you\nI never meant to hit you over the head-", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
