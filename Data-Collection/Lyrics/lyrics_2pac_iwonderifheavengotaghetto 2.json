Should I blast myself?\nI'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black\nMy stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch\nCops give a damn about a negro\nPull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero\nMo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas\nRather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga\nLet the Lord judge the criminals\nIf I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n\n[Chorus]\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nAnd I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\n(Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)\n(Soulja in the house)\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto\nYeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f924e981b74c6d754d2c9da26f83f15.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
