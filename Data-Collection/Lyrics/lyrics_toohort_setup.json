I'm tellin the truth\nThe man had a plan that was killin the youth\nYou can smoke it, or sell it, if you choose you lose\nIt was a set up, got everybody singin the blues\nThey gave you the crack to start flippin your sack\nYou makin your money, it's sittin in stacks (yeah)\nYou bought you some gats, for niggas who jack\nPut a 50 in the crib, motherfucker bag that (nigga what?)\nSomebody died, you're goin to war\nYou got a lot of straps and you want some more\nYou in the little leagues, AK's from the Middle East\nGuns and coke, you wanna get a piece?\nIt was a set up, that's what the O.G.'s say\nI heard Rick got his dope from the CIA\nA new kind of baller out in sunny Los Angeles\nBenzes, houses, young niggas havin this\nOakland got a taste and all over the place\nDetroit to Miami they was rollin case\nDown to I-75, whatchu need in Atlanta\nWhite Christmas, a bag full of dope like Santa\n\n(Whatchu need homey whatchu need?) It was a set up\n(I got whatchu need baby, I got whatever you need)\n(You got the money? I got the llello)\n\nDon't look in his eyes, use your automatic weapons\nShoot in the crowd and keep steppin (that's yo' ass)\nRead about it later, wrong nigga got hit\nShot a gangster in the leg, but you killed a little kid\nNow where in the fuck did the guns come from?\nThey used to put 'em up and say you want some?\nNow you get shot, makin all that loud noise (nigga)\nHave your pistol on your side like the cowboys (beotch)\nCause you can make a lot of money when you sellin dope\nSell your soul to the devil, say to hell with the Pope\nAt the Benz dealer (yea I want that one) spend a hundred thousand cash\nYou feelin like a hoe, money comin out your ass\nIn a way, it's not your fault\nYou stupid as fuck, that's why you got caught\nYou never get out, and I'm still amazed\nYou shoulda opened up a biz and bought some real estate\n(I'm havin money) Niggas strapped like the military\nKnow how to cook it, package it and get it there\nYou get paid? You coulda been a CPA\nWhen you weigh that yay, tell the DEA\nIt ain't mine (it ain't mine) I don't wanna do no time\nThey got the new laws havin niggas snitchin and lyin\nCause what we do y'all we gotta get our own hustle\nI'm cool on the coke, I don't want no trouble (fuck that)\nI got a felony (one strike) I was caught in a bust\nGot probation, they can't stop us (unstoppable)\nI got two gat cases and I still ain't been to jail\nThey caught my little homey on the hill and made him tell\nHe told about the murders and the whole operation (shit)\nI feel like the slave, on a plantation\nNow I'm stuck in here, and don't wanna stay\nI wish I was a kid so I could go out and play\n\n(They set me up man) It was a set up...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b217fd6496369f950dd5a8a14ae52aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
