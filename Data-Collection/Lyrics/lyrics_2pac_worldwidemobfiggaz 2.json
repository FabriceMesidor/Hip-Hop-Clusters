wake, early grave\nThat's what you brave niggas get for fuckin' with this\nYou had your chance to mob first you didn't you missed\nJust switched to fake\nNapoleon be the motherfuckin' last nigga with the gat to break\nThe last to fade, earthquake aftershock, is what you got\nFuckin' with niggas that give a damn about hip-hop\nThis how it go in our family\nCause this Outlaw shit is what we stand
