You want to get in my spot?\nYou want to click, click and hold on my Glock?\nNah player get your own pistol\nMy arms become dealers when I'm holding up that mic missile\nStay back with your rap, it might clip you\nI use smart mics, my words will hit you\nAs you can see I'm much realer\nWhen the mic weapon is in my arm, I become that rap arms dealer\nSo who da best? Who da best out here?\nWho claiming the crown when KRS out here\nWho da best motherfucker today? My fans are here to stay\nSixteen albums, not one of my producers were fake\nWho da freshest motherfucker in rap?\nYou better dig in your crates, who lives what they state?\nWho's the most consistent to date?\nIf you're talking 2Pac or B.I.G. you late (KRS!!)\nI ain't got a Maybach but I takes it way back\nKnowledge reigns supreme, watch how you say that\nI slept where the World Trade at\nRight at ground zero's where my head laid at\nNew York is where I'm raised at\nWhen it comes to Hip Hop, we made that\nWe can never trade that, for any payback\nYo JS!
