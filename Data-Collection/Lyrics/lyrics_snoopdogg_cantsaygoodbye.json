Nah\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThank God every day that the boy could spit\nAnd all around the world they enjoyin' my shit\nI know I got plenty more awards to get\nI got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids\nBut it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit\nThat made me who I am, the music and the man\nTold me that I can before the world gave a damn\nIf it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan\nProbably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand\nProbably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man\nThey say leave the streets but they don't really understand\nAll I had was the block when I didn't have fans\nRapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins\nAll I had was the homies when I didn't have kids\nIf it all came down, my career was to end\nI'm sure my name would live, in these streets\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd5ace5214e5da1f374653720da7d1c1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
