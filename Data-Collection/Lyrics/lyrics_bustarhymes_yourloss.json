Blige]\nYou said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya\nIf you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me\nCause I been too good to let you take me down\n[?] is that you drive me to drinking\nI'm feeling good and really good about me\nSo now that I know how to get it for myself\nThis is really your loss\n\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nNow seen them was the days\nWhen a nigga ain't ever really had shit\nAnd a nigga might of stole some shit\nCause a nigga ain't ever really\nHave a pot to piss inside of\nI was kinda hard-headed\nAnd I was the type\nThat'll quickly put the ratch up to you\nNigga being hard-headed\nAnd they never learn\nTill a mother fucker catch up to you\nOlder folk in the neighborhood\nDid their very best to really come try teach us\nEvery time they'd bounce they return\nJust to catch us on the corner smokin' them reefers\nDo a lot of dirt, do a lot of crime on the block for bread\nWhile the older folk were on their way home from church\nEvery single time they'd see use they shakin' they head\nAt the time when a nigga really needed some money\nKnow a nigga really followed deception\nAll the older gangsters though a nigga needed direction\nSo when the gangsters looked at a little nigga\nAnd they really seen they reflection\nNiggas gave me the trey eight special\nSaid a nigga needed protection\nA lot of mu'hfuckers that I thought I was cool wit'\nWas kinda hatin' me under... the surface\nNiggas really wished the worst for me\nLike I'm 'posed to suffer\nBut I wish the best for a nigga like you\nBut what you don't know about me\nIs that I'm really destined for this shit\nLet's see you do it without me\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nYou said you wouldn't mind so I'll go on without ya\nIf you wanna shine, I'll bet you shine without me\nCause I been too good to let you take me down\n[?] is that you drive me to drinking\nI'm feeling good and really good about me\nSo now that I know how to get it for myself\nThis is really your loss\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nLemme get up on my hustle\nAnd I hit the strip\nWhen I whip it and I dip and I boast\nSometimes the street might\nTry to bite a nigga that's why I drive with the toast\nSometime the block'll have a nigga feelin'\nLike a nigga crept with a ghost\nIt's nothin' though cause you we been a hood\nThat's why we reppin the most\nSee the gutter life'll do it to you\nAll you niggas on the grind\nAnd you go in to hustle for paper\nNigga watch these broke niggas try to bring it to you\nNo need to fight you to shine\nCause I was one of them\nHungry little hustlelin' niggas\nWho always gotta think big\nAnd you know a nigga stuck with the grind\nI wonder if it's really for the better or for the worse\nThese niggas that you thought was the closest to you\nEnd up becoming them niggas thats\nCrossing the line first\nSo I take it\nAll inside cause I guess its all a part of our growth\nYou know I gotta keep my eyes on a lotta niggas that I always\nThought was my folks\nViolate in any way\nYou think a nigga ain't gon' hurt you?\nJust cause you bitch don't mean you can't catch it\nNigga better move from my circle\nI wish the best for dudes like you\nBut what you don't know about me\nIs that I'm really destined for this shit\nLet's see you do it without me\n\n[Chorus: Mary J.
