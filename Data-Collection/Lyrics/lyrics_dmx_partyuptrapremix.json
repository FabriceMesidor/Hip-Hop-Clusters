WHOO!\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here, up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here, up in here\n\nIf I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight\nAll your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick\nAnd all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick\nHow the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight\nThere go the gun click, 9-1-1 shit\nAll over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit\nY'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime\nYou come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked\nAnd I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to\nBut I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do\nOr you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else\nAnd we all thought you loved yourself\nBut that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe\nThey just sayin' that, now cause they miss you\nShit a nigga tried to diss you\nThat's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church\nPreacher tellin' the truth and it hurts\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here, up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here, up in here\n\nOff the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain\n'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name\nFirst of all, you ain't rapped long enough\nTo be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough\nSo whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman\nI got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?\nY'all niggas is characters, not even good actors\nWhat's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors\nYou wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe\nYou're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know\nYour old man say you stupid, you be like, \"So?\nI love my baby mother, I never let her go\"\nI'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss\nThat don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?\nThey fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them\nWho get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here, up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here, up in here\n\nI bring down rains so heavy it curse the head\nNo more talkin - put him in the dirt instead\nYou keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red\nCause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead\nCause youse a soft type nigga\nFake up North type nigga\nPuss like a soft white nigga\nDog is a dog, blood's thicker than water\nWe done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter\nThe bigger the order, the more guns we brought out\nWe run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out\nSun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out\nNigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out\nListen, yo' ass is about to be missin\nYou know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin\nGrandma wishin your soul's at rest\nBut it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest\n\nY'all gon' make me lose my mind\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me go all out\nUp in here, up in here\nY'all gon' make me act a fool\nUp in HERE, up in here\nY'all gon' make me lose my cool\nUp in here, up in here\n\nHold up!
