Now its getting spooky\nIt switched to the Acura, Integs and Suzuki's\n'Lotta Ninos and Pookies\nDapper Dan... Silks and Bally's\nRopes Dookie\nWhoever was in office was letting it flow loosely\nSent crack, Some niggas came home then went back\nThugged out, shit wasn't the same so they bugged out\nI don't wanna rush into it\nLooking at my uncles and cousins do it\nThinking to myself, \"There's nothing to it\"\nNow I gotta pager, And the minor rock turned major\nCause the fiends is looking for the flavor\nNice little run with the crew, Money wasn't coming fast as i wanted it to\nSo I fell back, Took a deep breath\nInhaled rap, Waited for a spot to open up and held that\nEven tho, it's still a lotta bumps in the road yo'\nEverything is well-earned, Nothing is old though\nThink about it, while cleaning and loading the 4-4\nReality is, Death is convienent to most folks\nThe torch is lit, And me? I'm just fortunate\nTo be in it for this long still scorching shit\nEvery verse is food, Every song is dinner\nI belong with winners, Only the strongest finish\nSo you could be cool or you can wild till the end\nBut the same rules apply, From now till then", "image": "https://images.genius.com/34d1815281afeb502b98075367058136.453x453x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
