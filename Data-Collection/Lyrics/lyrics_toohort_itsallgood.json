Guess you wondered where I was at\nWhen you beeped me last night and I didn't call back\nSupposed to be there, meet you at the house at 9\nYou made a candlelight dinner just to wine and dine\nAnd I didn't even show up\nYou beeped me 20 million times, made my beeper blow up\nThought you shot me to the left cause I'm a D-O-G\nBut you called so I guess it's still cool for me\nTo get freaky, you know I got that git back\nI come right when I hit that\nAnd if you tell me right now it's cool today\nAs soon as I'm through I be on my way\n\n[Ronese Levias]\nDo I look like the type of lady\nThat'll talk to a brother that's shady, hell no\nBut you can wine and dine me\nSpend a little time with me, it's all good\nCause I love the way you take me\nOoh boy you shake me, when we lay down\nGot my head spinning around\n\n[Too $hort]\nI need a woman that's down for me\nAlways on my side, not my enemy\nWe could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends\nBut whatever we do, do it straight to the end\nWe'll make love like professionals\nYou and me baby, fuck the rest of them hoes\nYou know how much we like being together\nSeems like every second, it's getting wetter\nSo good I wish it'd last forever\nCause it would never get no better than this\nI know you feel the same\nMoaning so loud all the neighbors complained\nAnd all the people tried to tell you I was phony\nTalking all that junk and don't even know me\nLast night I was chilling at the club\nChilling with my potnas when your friends rolled up\nFlirting with your nigga behind your back\nThey called you on the phone and told you where I was at\nYour girlfriends trying to run your world\nYou'd better stop listening to them other girls\n\n[Ronese Levias]\nNever cared about those other girls\nIt's something about the way you rock my world\nEven though you make me cry\nI still wait alone for you at night, but it's all good\n\n[Too $hort]\nI couldn't come home last night cause I was out making money\nBut I'll come home tonight if you want me\nCause you sure looking good today\nI take you to your house and let you have it your way\n\n[Ronese Levias]\nOooh boy, ohhhh, it's all good, it's all good to me, baby\n\n[Too $hort]\nI just keep on fucking you all night long\nMe and you baby got it going on\nYou ain't tripping every time you see me\nYou get loose and you get so freaky\nI never meant to break your heart\nYou gave it all to me and I tore it apart\nTalked about love right to the end\nBut I'm a tell you like it is, I'll never do it again\nI'm from East Oakland, I'm an ice-cold player\nBorn to Mack and got women everywhere\nI got one up in E.P.A\nAnd two down in South Central L.A\nOne in Frisco, and one in Berkeley\nGot a few Southern girls just to work me\nIs that what you wanted to hear?\nThat your man is the player of the year?\nI need a woman that's down for me\nAlways on my side, not my enemy\nWe could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends\nBut whatever we do, do it straight to the end\nI said the very same thing in the beginning\nWe played the game but it's in the 9th inning\nYou'd better wake up and smell the dank\nIt really don't seem to be what you think, beyotch\nI'm all about getting my bank\nYou be the car and I'll fill your tank\nCause nothing don't come for free\nUnless your ass don't want to be with me, beyotch\n\n[Ronese Levias]\nBoy, have you been listening?\nI can't let you go since I know what I'm missing\nAnd can you fell it in my touch\nThat I want you so much, and it's all good\nIt's all good, baby\nI'm trying to tell you boy, that it's good\nIt's all good, it's all good, baby baby baby\nOhhh, like that baby, like that\nIt's all good, it's all good\nIt's all good, it's all good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a5180b05334d6ee85dd8f628e3e19d2.919x912x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
