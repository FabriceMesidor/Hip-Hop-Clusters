(what?!)\nShe didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)\nGot violated by someone she dated\nIf this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited\nThough it takes time to build a body and a mind\nShe reclines nine months then finally it's time\nWhat do we find?, little growin' boy of mine\nWith a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime\nHad no time for the growin' stage\nHe learned his values on the streets at an early age\nWatch for police, don't come home (why?)\nCuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al\n'bout to have another baby\nLike a rose from the concrete, growin' within\nBlessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?\nSo we began, closest family, such insanity\nA happy home, from one act of inhumanity\nPlus Mama said the seed was corrupted\nUsed to rub Her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us\nNow, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps\nTurned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)\nHow could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?\nShe ain't the cause of all the drama\nCause Mama's just a little girl\n\n[Hook: Kimma Hill]\nMama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know)\nMama's just a little girl\nLivin' if she is or not\nTime ain't on her side\nCause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)\nShe gotta hold her head up high\n(how could she raise us)\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow, will she remain in the same spot?\nThe gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot\nNow, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt\nHer heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt\nFulfilled prophecy\nBut who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me\nI'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse\nWhat could be worse?, nothing but pain, since my birth\nOnly functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in\nPayin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin\nI watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted\nI wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it\nThough we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried\nWorried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery\nMust be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares\nNo! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share\nIn this land of the underhanded schemes and plans\nVivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand\nMama told me not to be a punk\nFuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey)\nThere ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world\nCause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl (Heyheyy)\nHell naw,(that's right) see mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)\n\n[Hook: Kimma Hill]\nMama don't know why\nMama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)\nLivin' if she is or not\n(y'all ain't facin' all this drama cause mama just a little girl)\nTime ain't on her side\nCause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)\nShe gotta hold her head up high\n\n[Collision: 2Pac]\nThey ask us why we mutilate each other like we do\nAnd wonder why we hold such little worth for human life (Facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl)\nTo ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came (Mama's just a little girl)\nYou see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had\nDamaged petals\nOn the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity\nWe would all love its will to reach the sun\nWell, we are the roses (we are the roses)\nThis is the concrete (this is the concrete)\nAnd these are my damaged petals (these are my damaged petals)\nDon't ask me why (don't ask why)\nThank God, nigga  (thank god)\nAsk me how (Ahahaha)\nYou see, Mama's just a little girl\nMama (hey)...\nMama...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f7dcd7bb697e66f11fe0520838cb066.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
