Look your child's grown\nAnd I built somethin, Flipmode is touchin down stone\nLook you shouldn't have no fear\nAnd now we bringin the streets back, look how it feel out here\nNow y'all respect the hard work, but I don't care nigga\nWe all tryin to eat you better learn how to share\nYou see the moral of the story and from how it begins\nIs I'm extortin this whole shit - nigga I want in~!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Spliff Star]\nOpen up the blood clat door let me in\nBefore I let the barrel spin and fire off the pin\nThis is my block (block) this is my shop (shop)\nFuck a ex-cuse, give me mines off the top\nWhat'chu waitin on? All my patience is gone\nI ain't waitin on no man, I stick to the program\nKeep the pockets bulky like the muscles on Conan, swollen\nEuropean cars I be rollin - Spliff!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Show Money]\nGeah niggas, this is your fair warning\nI give one soo woo to the gang and they on it (soo woo)\nCause you know how I think, drugs and extortion\nWe tired of waitin nigga we want our portion\nYou know what we endorsin, more violence and more fortune\nWatch how you play with them boys - use caution\nIt's {Money Roll} geah\nAnd that whole motherfuckin Flipmode, don't cross them\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/39d2d4f1bba15212af6b346af49c7ff2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
