galleria shopping, buying\nGifts for some guy that she dating, still shot\nSecond anniversary and I'm congratulating that\nBut man she had an ass so fat\nYou couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands\nIt seems to me she had the whole world in her pants\nWalked behind her whispering love songs\nShe started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit\nAnd told her try it\nReplied, while with these light brown eyes\nI'm shopping for a lady friend about your size\nShe put it on so I paid for\nThen I told her she could keep it\nAnd then I walked out the store, it's our secret\nBut peep it\nMade it down the hall, she came running\nBags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning\nI don it\nMade a mack move and girl chased me\nAnd shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces\nIt's tasteless\nBut honey must of missed being treated\nLike something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating\nHer ass behind the silly shit\nAnd I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this\nLet's see the sights, its me tonight\nLet's leave him stuck home pacing\nBlowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces\n\n[Chorus]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brangs\nIt seems to me you hoes will never change\nSo all that's left is for us to exchange\n\n[Too $hort]\nI called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute\nCause all them faces she be making when I'm in it\nThey make a nigga feel like he doing something\nThe pussy so good have you through with money\nBut you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit\nEvery chance you get you trying to call that bitch\nQuite a few niggas got the pussy\nBut every time I see her got to stop and look\nCause she so damn fine bitch\nI want to make you mine bitch\nI want to fuck one time bitch\nShort Dogg's on your mind bitch\nI give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with\nStuck with, I love the way she suck dick\nIt make me bust this\nIt's hard to hold back when it's this good\nYou said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would\nCause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast\nWith this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last\nI got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really\nUnless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary\nExchanging fuck faces, making hella noise\nGetting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys\nCause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch\n\n[Chorus]\n[Devin]\nLet me holla at 'cha B, Short check this\nJust got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my\nPiss\nI stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it\nSucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it\nI bust 4, 5, 6\nNuts in her mouth, when she come to my house\nI know that's my bitch\nAnd she don't tell nobody shit\nShe keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine\nAnd because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time\nI'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side\nGirl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied\nBut I'm numero uno, the one and only\nBitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna\nThen picked, she licked on my dick like plop\nThe nut skeeted out like thick white snot\nShe saw it was still hard and said look what I got\nThen rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock\nTried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen\nI guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing\nAnd in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing\nAnd later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces\n\n[Chorus]\n[Tela]\nI got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces\nSaying its about six or seven dime pieces\nWe can hook up with no chains and no leashes\nTied to this fucking affair and slow leases\nSee what we go do is fall through with crushed ice\nMan these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights\nWhole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice\nNot too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet\nThe rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized\nThinking to myself at this time and realized\nShe ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs\nSomebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise\nEnter the room with the cat ass eyes\nRochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs\nSee I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit\nGet a nigga off in the room and pull shit\nGirl stop licking right there you killing me\nGo ahead and touch it right there and fell the P\nThis some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through\nDamn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me\nSo I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces\nYou getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases\n\n[Devin]\nYou know what I'm saying baby\nIt's either now or never\nToo $hort, Tela, Devin Scarface in style\n\n[Chorus]", "image":
