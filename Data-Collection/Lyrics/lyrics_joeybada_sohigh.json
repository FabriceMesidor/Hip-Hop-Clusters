Never lost my groove, I don't know no Stella\nIt's a cold world without Coachella\nA shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella\nBut that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy blunt\nCall me young Evel cause I crazy stunt\nAmaze these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya\nMr. Bada$$ is the scholar's tutors\nSwank the lord and hallelujah\nStill praying to the Allahs, Gods and Judas\n\n[Hook]\nBalance out my lows and I'm (so high)\nChillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)\nNigga ain't know I'm just (so high)\nKicking out my flow and I'm (so high)\nBalance out my lows and I'm (so high)\nChillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)\nNigga ain't know I'm just (so high)\nKicking out my flow and I'm (so high)\n\n[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]\nThe sun came up, don't wanna get out of bed\nTurn the TV on the price is right but your life is wrong\nTwo hits from the bong and my problems go gone\nMy rhyme game strong, bitch on my arm\nTryna be my girl, we mix the weed with the Marlboro\nWe way to fly to hit mall bro bro\nYour favorite brand gave me some pieces\nBut they clothes is ass, told em to fuckin' keep it\nStarted out on rookie, now we on some elite shit\nScribble raps on your iPhone, I make you delete shit\nPeep this, I was on a humble, you on every station\nI was dropping samples being patient\n\n[Hook]\nBalance out my lows and I'm (so high)\nChillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)\nNigga ain't know I'm just (so high)\nKicking out my flow and I'm (so high)\nBalance out my lows and I'm (so high)\nChillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)\nNigga ain't know I'm just (so high)\nKicking out my flow and I'm (so high)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04d0b6e6105201632be0a45e1968ba75.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
