Man, you wasted!\"\nWell, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else\nCause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt\nGot pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off\nAnd smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross\nI smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass\nFaster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast\nCome here, slut\n\"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!\"\nI don't give a fuck\nGod sent me to piss the world off", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b1c9568017c50ed4a1b0e810ff2a60c.480x360x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
