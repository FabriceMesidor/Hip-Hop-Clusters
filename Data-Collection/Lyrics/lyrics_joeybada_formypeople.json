I been up on an ultralight beam\nThey don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings\nEverything ain't what it seem\nWishin' all these dirty cops, would come clean\nStill swervin\u2019 on these city blocks, for one thing\nMy man just copped a 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?\nMusic is a form of expression\nI'ma use mine just to teach you a lesson\nRule one: this microphone's a weapon\nI'm shootin' out the actions manifested and my passion\nNever restin', I'm surpassin' the expectancy\nOf life in my direction\nMan the section 8 depressin'\nHard to be progressin' through recession and oppression\nNot to mention that they had us cell blocked ever since an adolescent\n\n[Chorus]\nThis for my people, tryna stay alive and just stay peaceful\nSo hard to survive a world so lethal\nWho will take a stand and be our hero, of my people, yeah?\nThis for my people\nTryna stay alive and just stay peaceful\nSo hard to survive a world so lethal\nWho will take a stand and be our hero?\n\n[Outro]\nOh, yeah\nOh, mm\nOh, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84b143545e0338f7b7459bb9ab8ecca4.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
