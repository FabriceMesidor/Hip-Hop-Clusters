Edgar Hoover's intestines\nNo question\nBut keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo\nWhen puffing marijuana couldn't get the time of day\nNow I'm fucking nigga's Mommas\nDrama's still part of my dietary\nHit hard like Singletary\nKill your daughter, bust her cherry\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAight, hold up hold up\nStop the beat a minute\nI got somethin' to say\nDre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me\n(What the fuck?)\nI don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dog\nI got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nSlim, I don't know if you noticed it\nBut I've had your back from day one nigga\nLet's blow this bitch\n\n[Eminem]\nI mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed - whose throat is it?\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nWell if you ever kill that Kim bitch\nI'll show you where the ocean is\n\n[Eminem]\nWell that's cool, and I appreciate the offer\nBut if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma\nI'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her\nAnd cruise around with her for seven hours through California\nAnd have her wavin at people (hi)\nThen drop her off on the corner\nAt the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her\nRaw dawg, get your arm gnawed off\nDrop the sawed off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of\nFuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up\nGet shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up\nAnd they nose and cough snot up\nMucus in hot water\nThat's for trying to talk like The Chronic was lost product\nThat's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up\nYou better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up\nSo what's the difference between us\nWe can start at the penis\nOr we can scream\n\"I Just Don't Give a Fuck,\" and see who means it\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
