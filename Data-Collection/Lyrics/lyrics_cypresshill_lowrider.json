Then I got luggage\nI stuff you in and send you off, cause you ain't rugged\n\n[Hook: B-Real & Mellow Man Ace]\nAww, comin' through fo' real we Cypress Hill, ohh baby\nGot that crunk, for yo' trunk, goin' gangsta crazy\nWe some real life hustlers, playin' games in the street (low-ri-der)\nWe got that low-ri-der, scrapin', dippin' on three\nSo pop yo' collar, give a holla, throw the dubs in the air (low-ri-der)\nWe tear the roof, off the mother, lady let down yo' hair\nPlaya do that thang, that make you feel alright (low-ri-der)\nSmoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight\n\n[Interlude: Sen Dog]\nCause, we're Cypress Hill, come on and ride with us\nJust get inside, we bouncin', dippin', chop it up real tough\nLean to the side, pimp yo' hat, tilt yo' seat on back\nDon't front on me, baby boy, and break bread with the sack (low-ri-der)\n\n[Verse 2: Sen Dog]\nI be the vato with the fine hoodrat in the ranfla\nAlways roll deep on the streets like the mafia\nPleito, just might come back and haunt ya\nFlossin' too much, no vato's gonna want ya\nNot right here homes, we're past all of that\nMakin' that feria, spittin' that raps\nYa me conoces, I'm down for my calle\nCypress Ave, y el puro desmadre (low-ri-der)\nYa tu sabes, we don't play that shit\nAny pendejo's gettin' hit up quick\nWassup ese?
