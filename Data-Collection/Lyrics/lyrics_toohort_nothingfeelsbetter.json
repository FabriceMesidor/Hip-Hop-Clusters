You said maybe later\nBaby wait a little while, you said your jaws was hurtin'\nSo I turned out the lights and closed all the curtains\nBut when you closed your eyes I put my balls on your cheek\nCause I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep\nNow lick it\n\n[Chorus: Jazze Pha]\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're suckin' my dick\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're lickin' my balls\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)\n\n[Verse 2: Too $hort]\nYeah I'm one of those rappers, I reap the benefits\nI'll fuck a Too $hort fan, a cute freaky lil' bitch\nI used to go to L.A. and get sucked by Super Head\nWhen you was just a kid gettin' sent straight to bed\nYou used to get ya ass whooped when ya listened to $hort\nBut now she's all grown up with my dick in her throat\nThe way you take it out, then you stick in your mouth\nI bet you won a gold medal at the Dick Olympics now\nI just spit the pimpin', I like the thick women\nI like the slim goodies and the real big women\nBut I just love the way you lickin', it's original\nI feel like a pimp-player-mack-daddy-gigolo\nDamn\n\n[Chorus: Jazze Pha]\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're suckin' my dick\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're lickin' my balls\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)\n\n[Verse 3: Too $hort]\nRemember Tina? Tina, the sperm cleaner?\nI had a good time last time I seen her\nBlowjob Betty, Deepthroat Dana\nYou're always so ready, I'm cummin' on your cranium\nRight now, this is just wonderful\nI can't tell, it's like you havin' more fun than $hort\nIt's better than - two bitches at the same time\nOr even ten dime-pieces, standin' in line\nTakin' turns, while they suck on each others clits\nWant a nigga with some game to nut on her upper lip\nMassagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils\nIt's no doubt though, I get big in your mouth ho\n\n[Chorus: Jazze Pha]\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're suckin' my dick\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)\nNothin' in the world make a nigga feel better\nThan when you're lickin' my balls\n(Lick it right there, suck it real good\nLick it right there, suck it real good)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a946f356e20bac26df64ff8cca250ed8.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
