Anything whatever\nI can't tell ya, I can show ya better\nMe-me and my gun, we took an oath together\nSaid I will never die, if we both together\nYeah, this is my testification\nI'm Wayne on their hands like precipitation\nAnd in hell you, you need justification\nBut, but for me it was just a vacation\nHeheh, yeah\n\n[Hook: Shanell]\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'\nRunnin' run it all\nWhen's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin'\nRun it all!\n\n[Verse 2: Shanell]\nI lost all my money\nI lost half my mind\nCan't find my direction\nWhere's the finish line?\nCould I be far away from it all?\nHow far it gone\nIf I can stay for it all\nThen I shouldn't fall\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Shanell]\nUhh, but if I fall, I fall up and let the clouds hug me\nAnd if I fall down, I bet I hit the ground runnin'\nBet you search and found nothin', looking for the finish line\nStop short cuttin', you fuckin' up your finish time\nShit, but every twice in a while\nIt feels like I'm runnin', and life is the miles\nYeah, but until the lights dimmin down\nI'll be runnin' around, runnin', runnin'\nOhh, ohh-whoa, will you tell me?\n\n[Hook: Shanell]\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'\nRunnin' run it all\nWhen's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin'\nRun it all!\n\n[Verse 4: Shanell & Lil Wayne]\nCounting all my pennies but it doesn't add up\nAt the mercy but somehow it ain't enough\nReading all the red lights trying not to give up\nBut I don't know how long it's gonna last, ohh\nIt's almost over now\nI say it's almost over now\nThe end is gettin closer now\nBetter do what you suppose to cause the world is all so short now\n\n[Hook: Shanell]\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'\nRunnin' run it all\nWhen's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end up?\nRunnin', runnin', runnin'\nRun it all!\n\n[Outro: Shanell & Lil Wayne]\nWhen's it gonna end?\nWhere's it gonna end?\nRunnin, run it all!\nYeah! I'm runnin outta time, I'm runnin out of space\nFeel like I'm runnin round, but I'm runnin in place\nWe all in the race, I'm just another sprinter\nIf there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b09ba658e01574285934c93014f48d1.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
