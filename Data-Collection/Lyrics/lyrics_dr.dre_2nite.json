I'm with it\nThen lay your seat way back like it was vintage\nWhile I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach\nCamouflage emotions got your feelings wide open\nI'm hoping you come to grips\nAt least before you provoke 'em to trip\nBut that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal\nThat means I'm fuckin' you on a chair\n\n[Hook: Jeremih]\nTonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)\nYou're gonna get wetter (Wetter)\nWe're gonna take our time\nNot tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love\n(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)\n\n[Bridge: Jeremih]\nNow don't you no worry about that\nWhatever you want, I'm on that\nSo don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely\nBaby, don't worry, we know that I got you\n\n[Verse 3: Jeremih]\nNow that I got you about they thinking out you\nI want to stop and I don't want you to stop that\nOw, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait\nCause waters don't label you, oh, no, no\nI'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that\nHow about with the top back with your top back?\nTake that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more\n\n[Hook: Jeremih]\nTonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)\nYou're gonna get wetter (Wetter)\nWe're gonna take our time\nNot tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love\n(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
