My semi leave you chestless\nAnd ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless\nYoung, but I done did shit that you won't do\nSo go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through\nI got niggas who pump on yo' block and in yo' spot\nWho sit next to you? Protectin you?\nBut they'll murder you, playa\nDon status, nigga we gettin chipsesis\nAnd bad bitchsesis, frontin, frontin in eclipsesis\n\nAyo, Ma$e and The LOX\nWe takin knots from the out of state spots\nAny nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot\nYou don't really wanna come try, the one guy\nWho stay dumb high from blunt lye\nThe rack of sing-sing alumni\nWho got more beef than a Islamic farm\nSo I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs\nIt's not a nigga in your gang want it\nMy AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas names on it\nOften I bug, then we'll soften a thug\nHave a chump coughin blood, fill his coffin with slugs\nYo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation\nAny nigga wave a Tec at Ma$e, and, have a explanation\nYou bring your crew and em and I'm doin em\nThen I'm beatin em down with aluminum\nThen I'm puttin two in em\nYou can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement\nA lot of other things, but that's irrelevant\n\nIf you love the money, then prepare to die for it\nNiggas done started somethin\nYou can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it\nNiggas done started somethin\n\nIf you love the money, then prepare to die for it\nNiggas done started somethin\nYou can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it\nNiggas done started somethin\n\nIf you love the money, then prepare to die for it\nNiggas done started somethin\nYou can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it\nNiggas done started somethin\n\nYo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa\nNever turned down chocha, be in the Costa\nRica, sippin margaritas wit a mami\nCleanin my Tommy, showin love to my army\nWhenever The LOX find rippy blocks, we kill em\nYeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel em\nAnd this for the listeners, and prisoners\nAnd them jealous rap cats that prefer dissin us\nMy 16's be so real, you can feel em in your vain\nLike Ramello's pops from Sugarhill\nJ be the cause for the kiss at your wake\nCartel lips, spittin clips at your face\nWe started from the bottom\nYou'll see bad niggas pardon, whatever\nWe can do it at the Garden\nWord life, this shit is real big\nI'm makin niggas blow trial even if they not guilty\n\nI want a palace for my thugs, wit oriental rugs\nGreen bags from drugs, get wacked for the love\nTwenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me\nI'm only gettin up, splittin up your anatomy\nOfficial lock family, grants niggas handin me\nI want the finer things, and I hope you understandin me\nSittin at the table, plannin and plug the fan in\nLet the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon\nThink you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless\nIf you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like Pesci\nAnd if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle\nAny ya niggas done started somethin\nActin invincible like you god or somethin\nIf you god, then I'ma makes a lot til you rot\nAnd if you a playa, then play for everything you got\nAnd if you a thug, then start bustin off shots\nAnd if you a dog, you better bite before you bark\n\nIf you love the money, then prepare to die for it\nNiggas done started somethin\nYou can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it\nNiggas done started somethin\n\nDon't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution\nCause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions\nFor bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering\nGot niggas fearin, fuck whatchu heard, this whatchu hearin\nHow much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit\nSee if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit\nI like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet\nCause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggas see sheep\nBloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud\nFollowing traces of gun powder, residue and blood\nA positive ID is impossible, so you know\nJohn Doe is what they gon' be puttin on that tag on yo' toe\nNow who gon tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue\nStiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs\nSon of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen\nSo you got whatchu came for\nWhat's that?\n\nSurgery wit the chainsaw grrrrr, I hit the fuckin streets\nCause like I said before ain't nothin goin down until I eat\nMu'fuckers think it's all about impressin bitches and stressin bitches\nWell, I'm testin bitches game, adressin bitches, and caressin bitches\nAnd dealin wit mu'fuckers on all levels\nWhat I'm dealin wit is all devils, fuckin with snakes\nRunnin wit niggas you call rebels\nI got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas\nThat come through and worry niggas\n30 niggas that like to bury niggas\nAnd scary niggas get it all the time\nCause what they got is all of mine\nYour man was talkin shit until I pulled the nine\nAnd if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu\nAnd if you wit my man, then he gettin stuck witchu\nAnd gave it the money\nCause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line\nSent his back through his chest\nThen I tossed the nine, boss of crime\nBlack Gotti, I stack bodies wit the black shotty\nBitch-ass niggas who act snotty\nGet it\n\nThese niggas is for real\nThese niggas ain't playin\n\nThis ain't no fuckin game\nYou think we playin?\nRuff Ryders\nGrrrrrr", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
