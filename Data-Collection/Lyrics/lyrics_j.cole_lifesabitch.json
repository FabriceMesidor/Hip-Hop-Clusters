Cause my reviews are thumbs down?\nI pay no mind, cause I know time is life's windex\nSo in due time, you'll see clearly just who gon' raise that index\nFinger, Let's see who falls like Jenga\nWho gets the glory, boy meets world, let's see who gets Topenga\nMan, when you losing nobody gon' talk to you like strangers\nLook mama, I made it, won't you know it\nEverybody speak my language, yeah, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cd936e786e1ab454043327d585c7702.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
