I didn\u2019t remember much\nHer teeth, and uhh...\nIt definitely stood out\nI remember her smell and her touch\nThe way she used to talk to me\nIt all hurts so much now\nHow could I waste so much time on someone that doesn't even love me?\nAnd even all the time I spent, it's all pointless\nNow I feel like I don't even wanna live anymore\nSave me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/72c5805f41e83b1608316eaf01cbc753.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "XXXTENTACION"}
