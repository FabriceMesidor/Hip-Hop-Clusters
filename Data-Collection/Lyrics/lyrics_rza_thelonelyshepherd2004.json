Cottonmouth.., revenge is a thesis\nShe been bustin' off kneecaps, since the age of eleven\nBut fuckin' the enemy to death, that was her favorite weapon\nAnd the debt you paid in hell, can't be paid in heaven\nYou better get on your knees, and started praying to the reverend\nBon appetit, boy, revenge is so sweet\nEspecially on a cold dish, she has no wish\nBut to cut your day short, like the winter solstice\nAnd a chance to receive mercy from her, was hopeless\nO-Ren Ishii, half Chinese/half Japane-see\nHalf American, muaww, and oh, what a species", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0050e4b1c52ecca6d63818331b489e2a.683x683x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
