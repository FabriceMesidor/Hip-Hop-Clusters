Alright\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nOle foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride\nOh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride\n\n[Verse: Eminem]\nWell foolish pride has a lot of things to say\nYou got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay\nBut tooth decay is another problem\nSo let's take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it\nNow, when I talk about foolish pride\nI mean blacks and whites taking different sides\nWhen blacks and whites take different sides\nUnity never happens, and we will subside\nWe will subside and hatred will release\nAnd everything will just crush that peace\nBut when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other\nBut remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister\nJust like I'm a mister\nI seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her\nI kissed her, I placed it on her cheek\nAnd she didn't come back 'til next week\nNow it was next week and she was back again\nWanting to kiss a white kid\nSo she was my girlfriend, we started going out\nBut that's okay because we were black and white\nBlacks and whites sometimes mix\nBut black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks\nSo I'ma say like this\nDon't date a black girl, take it as a diss\nIf you want, but if you don't\nI'ma tell you like this, I surely won't\nNever date a black girl because blacks only want your money\nAnd that shit ain't funny\nSo I'ma say look honey\nWhy do you do this?\nYou know, you step up to me like you a Brutus\nThen you try to grab my spinach\nBecause it's green and that's cash\nSo get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass\nI said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore\nBlack girls and white girls just don't mix\nBecause black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks\nWhite girls are good, I like white girls\nI like white girls all over the world\nWhite girls are fine and they blow my mind\nAnd that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme\n'Cause black girls, I really don't like\nWe don't mix, it's like riding a bike\nWhen you're peddling hard, uphill both ways\nYou know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you\nI'm giving you a little advice\nDon't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice\nYou won't ever do it again because they'll take your money\nAnd that ain't funny\nSo I'ma say, \"Look honey\"\nI thought I said that before\nBut like I said again you're nothing but a big whore\nSo when mike catch on the bass line\nThat's okay \u2018cause we will not just waste time\nI'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches\nThat's why I'ma tell you you better pull up your britches\n\u2018Cause all that cash is making your ass drag\nFrom the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad\nI mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy\nAnd then you turn around and fuck another big black guy\nNow that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking\nBut that's okay because you need a god damn spanking\nFrom me, the funky M&M\nI'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm\nI'm busting a freestyle just like this\nI say \"swallowing\" phlegm and Howard gets pissed\nBut when Howard gets pissed that's okay\nBecause he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days\nSo I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it\nI'll cross that bridge when I come to it\n'Cause\u2014 I forgot the chorus\nBut that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us\nSo I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl\nShe turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl\nA wack girl, because black girls ain't funny\nAll they want is your goddamn money\nThey take you for everything you've got\nAnd then you stand with a bunch of snot\nIn your hand\nSo I'ma kick it to you just like this\nHow does the chorus go?\nI forgot\nBut that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride\nI'ma say, \"Ole foolish pride\"\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nOle foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride\nOh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride\nOh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride\nOh, oh, oh, ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh\nDate a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fcaefd6b7d703e1fe1aa042c3e8c3c7f.599x546x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
