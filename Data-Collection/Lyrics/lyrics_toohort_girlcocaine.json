come from the city of dope\nIt couldn't be saved by John the Pope\n'Cause a basehead never sees the light\nTwo fat raps to the head last night\nCocaine Cocaine, is that your rap?\nEvery day and night it's coming back\nC-O-C-A-I-N-E\nThe rich man's high is what it used to be\nBut things looking different in '85\nCocaine, cocaine is that your high?\nSince age thirteen, what have I seen?\nA lotta baseheads, straight coke fiends\nSnorting, puffing, that's the life\nBut it's all over when you hit that pipe\nBig coke dealers on the knock\nAll smoked out with no more rocks\nBaseheads buy, coke from him\nBut he smokes more than all of them\nThe big coke man, ain't too cool\nHe smokes more than all you fools\nHe's got a lotta dope, but not a lotta bank\nA brand new car with an empty tank\nPretty white smoke all in his chest\nAnd a '84 Benz, repossessed\n\n[Hook:]\nGirl, that's your life (Don't do it)\nGirl smoking that glass pipe (Don't do it)\n\n[Verse 2:]\nFresh young tender, only fifteen\nWalking on a strip, just wanna be seen\nNever touched coke a day in her life\nBut now that girl's gotta have her pipe\n'Cause she met a man, his name was Jock\nDo it to her a good and he smoked a rock\nPut it in a joint all crunched up\nAnd now every day she takes a puff\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI know you know what coke can do\nCome into your life and take over you\nNow you're kicking back thinking 'bout your dream\nBut it never comes true 'cause you're just a coke fiend\nYou asked your woman 'What's the prob?'\nShe said 'It's you 'cause you don't do your job'\nUsed to make good love from the start\nBut now the coke did damage to your private parts\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 4:]\nYour mind is gone, your brain is blazed\nYou've been wide awake for the last three days\nInhale, exhale, you don't care\nCoke smoke only, no fresh air\nYou can't even talk, you don't wanna listen\nYou and your buddy on a cocaine mission\nThree days straight, where's your mind?\nIt's gone out of town and your brain is fried\nJust smoke and choke until you're broke\nJust smoke that coke until you croak\nAnd it would be, I can't lie\nNo good loss if you should die\n'Cause your life is wrecked, your girl was checked\nShe chose on me and I was set\nI took her home to make my move\nBut she wanted to base, she's just like you\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 5:]\nYou saved your money for a year-and-a-half\nYou're so damn stupid, you make me laugh\nBought a car co-signed by Daddy\nA 1980 Fleetwood Caddy\nYou drove that car every place\nUntil that day when you first based\nLook at it now, the real big wheeler\nSold that Caddy to a big coke dealer\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 6:]\nWhen you base coke, until you're broke\nWhere I come from, we call you smoked\nS-M-O-K-E-D\nTo smoke more coke is all you need\nYou say coke is it, it's all that counts\nIt's got more ounce to the bounce\nIt put your life in a state of shock\nGot you singing to yourself \"I'm the king of rock\"\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 7:]\nRocks made you, and now you simp\nSeven hookers and one down pimp\nIf you never based, in the first place\nThere's no way you could pimp today\n'Cause it got you sprung, and you said 'Look\nI gotta have money 'cause I am hooked'\nNone of your girls would ever quit\n'Cause you used game to get a hit\nYou're the best basehead to ever live\nYou always take and you never give\nYou got your girls hooked too\nAnd that is why right now you're through\nThey took your house, car and gold\nAnd you got life with no parole\nSmooth locked down, without a doubt\nYou killed two hookers when they smoked you out\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 8:]\nYou say don't knock it, until you try it\nIt cost too much, I'd never buy it\nSo I won't try it, and you should knock it\nYou always have coke in your pocket\nWherever you go, in this world\nIt's not just you, it's you and that girl\nYou love Snow White, she's your life\nSmoking that coke in a glass pipe\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 9:]\nYou needed some money and your girl came through\nNow you're gonna smoke for a hour or two\nBut that's not you, that's what you thought\nFake base rocks is what you bought\nFrom some young brother, on some street\nOne sick basehead just got beat\nGot his rocks and rushed them home\nPut it on the pipe and they just phoned\nOne sick basehead lost all hope\nThought he bought coke and just bought soap\nGot his gun and who got shot\nSome young punk at the base rock spot\nStanding out there, all alone\nOne basehead, his mind was gone\nHe had to shoot 'cause someone got\nOne basehead with a fake base rock\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 10:]\nIt's the C-O-C-A-I-N-E\nThe rich man's high is what it used to be\nBut things looking different in '85\nCocaine, cocaine, the whole world's high\nWherever I go, in any town, you know cocaine is all around\nRight now today, in '85\nYou better stop smoking while you're still alive\n\n[Outro:]\nGirl, that's your life\nGirl, smoking that glass pipe\nThat's your life\nSmoke that glass pipe\nThat's your life\nJust smoke that glass pipe\nGirl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4c1af3f94eb962ad44c9dcd4a2cb304.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
