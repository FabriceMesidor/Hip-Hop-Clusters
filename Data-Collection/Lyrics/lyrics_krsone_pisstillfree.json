I gotta run back and feed my son\"\nI said, \"How old is your son?\" She said, \"Three months\"\nI walked away but my man cold bust her fronts\nSo she pulled out a gun and shot him in the party\nExcept for the MC's, I knew EVERYBODY\nShe tried to let off a shot, one more time\nBut got stomped so bad, she turned to wine\nNo one could find Denise for several weeks\nYou know the time, on this '93 beat\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI knew a group that had a dope lead singer\nSwinger, single guy, that knew his style was fly\nAfter the show he was tired sweaty and kinda sloppy\nBut of course, a million girls are in the lobby!\nHe saw a group of girls hangin out and lookin good\nSo he took one to his room because he knew he could\nInside the room he said, \"Make love to me and never stop\"\nShe said, \"Sure, but how's about a crack rock?\"\nI knew my man down the hall had it all\nSo he called, down the hall, but homeboy wasn't there at all\nHe turned to the girl and said, \"My man ain't there\"\nSo she let down her hair, unzipped his pants down right there\nOral sex in effect, or rather deep throat\nBut just before he came she bit his dick and slit his throat\nAs he fell back dizzy, he began to choke\nShe took his wallet and said, \"You ain't broke!\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n* DJ Premier cuts n scratches \"Oh yeahhh!\" *\n\nYes Premier you know you rule hip-hop, an'\nYes Ced Gee you know you run hip-hop, an'\nYes Kenny bwoy you run hip-hop, an'\nBut KRS-One'll rock it non-stop!\nWhen I'm Brooklyn, we rulin HIP-HOP!\nWhen I'm in Jersey, we runnin hip-hop\nOver in Brazil yes we rulin HIP-HOP!\nOver in Germany we rulin hip-hop\nBut in New York, we rulin y'all tonight badda-bye-bye-bye\nIn New York, we rulin y'all to-NIGHT!\nWe come to rock you whether you black or you white\nCause KRS-One, you know I'm never frank, come catch the style\n\n[Hook]\n\n* DJ Premier cuts n scratches \"Boogie Down Productions\" *", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2573d3afb044969d03669dee90d609f7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
