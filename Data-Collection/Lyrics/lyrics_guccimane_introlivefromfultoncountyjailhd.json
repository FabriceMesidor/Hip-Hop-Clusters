Robin jeans\nGlock 45, I don't know what robbin' means\nIt's like you're talkin Japanese you're talkin' robbin' me\nMy girl she said it's over Gucci, I said OK\nTo tell the truth I never liked her ass, no way\n??? baby your life's a crazy ?\nI told you ??? look at all the ?? nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1e86882e49586297dcbe8c6885a8b32.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
