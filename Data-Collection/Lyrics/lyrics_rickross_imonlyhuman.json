Now the tears won't stop!\nMomma held down three jobs, can she live on top?\nNever flew on a plane 'til my LP drop\nSo I told her once week that her ears are gonna' pop!\n(ROSS!)\n\n[Rodney]\nOh, yeahhh!\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make-I'mma make-I'mma make mistakes\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make my mistakes\n\n[Rick Ross]\nWake up Sunday morning, wanna see my son\nHe already wanna see his sister, he ain't seen in months\nI know it's about the dollars, so I'm steamin' blunts\nAt the custody hearing and I'm clean as fuck! (BOSS!)\nI ain't mad at cha girl, do your thing!\nLast night I hit the club and I threw that change! (Yeah!)\nI'm a light you a moth, unemployed to a Boss!\nAnother young broad, I would run in there raw\nRaw, raw - oh yes I am!\nChevy all brown, call it Mex-I-Can\nI run D.C. like Leo G\nIn A-T-L, I keep a bird in the P-O-T\nM-I-A! I'm The Mayor on my J-O-B\nYou OD'd, O-Z's on the C-O-D\nBink in VA, drinking V8\nThis weed case got me ready to stick the DA\n\n[Rodney]\nOh, yeahhh!\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make-I'mma make-I'mma make mistakes\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make my mistakes\n\n[Rick Ross]\nI know I'm not perfect (For real!)\nBut I perfected, what I had to work with\nTrunk full of sack, saying my prayers\nLet me cut the music down so The Lord can hear!\nPsalm 27, ink tatted in my arm\nMade me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong\nYoung D-Boys always bragging about the run\nI was on my third Rolley - now, I guess we're the bomb!\nNow it's deep cuts in the club for the watch\nMight let two dimes just fuck while I'll watch!\nI'm a Delano, it's Tony Soprano\nI fuck with Chicanos\nThey get it, G - I know!\n\n[Rodney]\nOh, yeahhh!\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make-I'mma make-I'mma make mistakes\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make my mistakes\n\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make-I'mma make-I'mma make mistakes\nI'm only human\nI'm a man, I make mistakes\nI'mma make my mistakes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f8b2e81ca63aac9b6abc1db39b51d092.520x516x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
