Man, I'm the gift of change\nElectric stoves so give me the keys to the Range\nShagadelic, beautiful but strange\nWent to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames\nRearrange, same broad different night\nPass the E&J and let a nigga get right\nThe bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight\nThe highlight's that I live a high ass life\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\n'Cause it's too many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch\nToo many niggas, not enough hoes\nToo many rookies, not enough pros\nThe game got switched on some Ludacris shit\nSo all y'all can suck my dick, bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9ea8d719979b4d9e52d89271c9e0b7da.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
