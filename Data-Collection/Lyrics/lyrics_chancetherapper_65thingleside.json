My first A&R\nThat shit was played unless you would hit play in the car\nWe hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car\nBack in the spot, don't put it in park\nLeave that bitch running in case I come running\nAnd skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold SCAR\nThere it get late 'fore it's dark\nKensli couldn't play in the park\nNow she could play in the stars\nHigh rise, eye to eye with fireworks\nSo high your ears fire, they might've burst\nEvery time they buy a verse, I buy a purse\nBut you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works\nThree jobs, you afforded the crib\nFuck child support, you supported the kid\nA full rack a month, nothing short of my rib\nSo you first up, go in order of dibs\nMy big homie told me, \"Nigga growth and development\nGo and settle down, don't settle for settlement\"\nShe got you closer to God than you two ever been\nShe moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston\nFirst lady you knew, you can't marry her?\nGot shit sonny, now you can't share?\nNew Dad step in, you can\u2019t stare?\nYou knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer\nOn 65th and Ingleside\nFeel like you remember every single lie\nTruth is I just really need your finger size\nSo I can make sure that they make the ring so tight\n\n[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]\nThere's a way, out of no way\nSwear I know everything's gonna be okay\nSo you know\nThere's a way, out of no way\nSwear I know everything's gonna be okay\nGonna be okay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5db21d647c06dc02686fe63b7c132a2f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
