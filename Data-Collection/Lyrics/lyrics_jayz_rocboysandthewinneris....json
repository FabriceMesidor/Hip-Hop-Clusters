Hov...\nMy man!\nSpeech!\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nFirst of all, I wanna thank my connect\nThe most important person, with all due respect\nThanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag\nThe Nike shoe box for holding all this cash (Okay!)\nBoys in blue who put greed before the badge (Okay!)\nThe first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!)\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)\nOh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)\nThanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim\nThanks to a little change, I tore you out the game\nBullet wounds will stop your buffoonery\nThanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy\nTo Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who\nCarry the work cross state for a gentlemen\nYeah, thanks to all the hustlers\nAnd most importantly you: the customer\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)\nOh what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)\nYou don't even gotta bring your paper out\nWe the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-)\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight\nLook at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice\nYou don't even gotta bring ya purses out\nWe the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-)\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nLet ya hair down baby, I just hit a score\nPick any place on the planet, pick a shore\nTake what the Forbes figured, then figure more\n'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw\nPick a time, let's pick apart some stores\nPick a weekend for freaking for figure fours\nI figure frauds never hit a lick before\nSo they don't know the feeling when them things get across\nPut ya hand out the window, feel the force\nFeel the Porsche, hit defrost\nIce-cold, jewels got no flaws\nDrop got no top, you on the top floor\nPink Ros\u00e9, think OJ\nI get away with murder when I sling yay\nHer-on got less steps than Britney\nThat means it ain't stepped on, dig me?\n\n[Chorus:

drinks is on the house\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-)\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nRare Porsches, rare portraits\nRare guns if you dare come near the fortress\nThis apple sauce is from the apple orchard\nThis kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses\nWhich means I get it from the ground\nWhich means you get it when I'm around\nRich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs\nMazel tov, it's a celebration bitches!\n\"L'chaim!\"\nI wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time\nCheers, toast to crime\nNumber one D-boy, shame he could rhyme\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Cassie & (Kanye West)]\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)\nOh what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)\nYou don't even gotta bring your paper out\nWe the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-)\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight\nLook at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice\nYou don't even gotta bring ya purses out\nWe the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-)\n(We in the house, hou-, hou-, HEY)\nThe Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)\nOh what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)\nYou
