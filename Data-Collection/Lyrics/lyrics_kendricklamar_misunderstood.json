Leave 'em by the benches\n\n[Hook]\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh lord please don't let me be misunderstood\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI see the future better than your computers\nApple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger\nRugers on my hip, terminate all intruders\nLeave them dead inside the sewers\nShoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer\nBurning up the very sun, the rapture\nThe god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster\nI'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield\nThe nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on\nNow the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb\nInside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect\nIf I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check\nPreach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying\nKing of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel\nBecause I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch\n\n[Hook]\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh lord please don't let me be misunderstood\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Rock]\nMy flow cold, like Aspen\nI love to show off when I'm in that Aston\nLook I act a ass, but I'm not jack\nA east side nigga I can get you popped at\nA hundred rounds nigga stop that\nYou can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back\nI'm too gutta nigga top that\nThis is lyrical homicide, not rap\nSo don't get it misunderstood\nSay my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood\nWith 45 goons 45 shugs\nChase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof\nI see you big dogs, all I hear is woof\nLoud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss\nI'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life\nOr how to make a mill and spend it all in one night\nI just might...\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\n...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite\nFor the top dog catalog, that means everybody\nSeveral bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers\nDamn I hate rappers, don't call me that\nIf you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap\nI don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real\nEat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will\nHold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill\nFour fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till\nPut me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head\nTell them about the g-code, like eskimos\nMy arms froze, popsicle\nObserving the game, I'm so official", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b626036c563b0aefa7a5b83f1fb9302.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
