You wanna render me?\nHarmless and surrender me for the fucking enemy?\nI won't let ya I bet ya I reign supreme\nMake your fans forget ya search ya in front of your team\nMake a nigga smoke a ounce and bounce over the rhythem\nAnd hit em and get another suck and hit em with venom\nNigga my name is Sen and I'm real while you're pretending\nSuckers with no style I hope you get offended\nSo I can lock your ass up with my jawclutches\nThen my rhymes will catch you cause they're sharp like Tony Touch's\n\nChorus\n\n[Sen-Dog]\nYeah, that's right y'all\nGonna smash you in the face\nWho be comming on touching me, getting around me\nI'm a bomb you know what I'm saying\nI'm ready to go off you know what I'm saying\nSo many motherfuckers out there talking shit, doing their little thing\nIt's cool you know what I'm saying, go ahead make you money\nBut don't you be comming around me perplexing playing like a bitch\nYou know what I'm saying\nCause I can see your ass right through you know what I'm saying\nYou're glass homeyboy, you're glass you know what I'm saying\nDon't play me too close y'all\nI don't think I like you too much you know what I'm saying\nAlways kicking it, doing what we do\nTrying to act like us, trying to sound like us\nYou're playing me too close motherfucker\nYou need too step the fuck on back\nTake your ass on back to wherever the fuck you come from\nYou're playing me way way too close you know what I'm saying", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af5085b228c3f1b6bc3a2ac39f6c6be8.1000x977x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
