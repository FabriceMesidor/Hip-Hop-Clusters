Fish out of water from the city of the dreamers\nWhen young niggas feinding for them big body beamers\nThey told us we can have the world if I can get a deal\nMaybe I could show the Ville that it's real\n\nI put this on everything, I love\nThis is, my sweat and uhh my blood\n(Who's world is this) You know it's mine\nBoy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind\n(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball\nAnd uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall\n(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby\n(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine)\n\nHey, straight out the Ville and I made it, hope you feeling my latest\nAyy what I spit on these pages highly anticipated, contagious\nSo when I spit it you gonna get it\nSlightly different from these rappers who just spit but don't live it, see\nI ain't no flashy nigga so don't expect me to floss\nThese niggas out here rappin with their fucking fingers crossed\nI was a dreamer then I came up with a plan\nWhere I land I put it all on gods hands\n\nI put this on everything, I love\nThis is, my sweat and uhh my blood\n(Who's world is this) You know it's mine\nBoy I'm ready, it's my time, I got that flow to blow your mind\n(Who's world is this) I'm gon ball\nAnd uhh I'm gon shine and uhh I won't fall\n(Who's world is this) I thought I told you this is my world baby\n\nAnd I feel like I got a loong way to go\nAnd still I got a loong way to go\nFeel like I got a loong way to go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af872f434781cc2e780c56c5186c8600.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
