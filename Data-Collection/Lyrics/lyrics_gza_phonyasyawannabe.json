They take MC'ing for a practical joke\nYou don't have what it takes to be an MC\nYa just as phony as ya wanna be\n\nYou present yourself to be the quiet storm\nYou're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form\nBut as they say, yo, to each its own\nAnd to each one who plays with a microphone\nAbbreviate microphone and M.I.C\nMeaning what, Myself, I, you see\nI invite those to battle me then they're through\nBust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too\nThe rap convention or the MC show\nI have rhymes to block those who hit below\nThe belt, that means biting a rhyme\nYes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time\nNow who is known to uphold his own\nAnd words are heard like a strong baritone\nFreestyle techniques that's wild and bold\nThat'll smile in your face and still come so cold\nThat I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost\nNow you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost\nShould I, could I, would I lose\nWhen it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose\nTo roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth\nBecause you're upset that you ever caused beef\nYo homeboy, I never meant to tease\nBut it's a slaughter, can someone help him please\nFeeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt\nOnce The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt\nThen after ya melt, ya start dripping like water\nThen you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter\nYou don't have what it takes to be an MC\nYa just phony as ya wanna be\n\nAin't no rhymes like the one I got\nThey put competitors in a trance, y'all\nRadio stations ran them a lot\nThey made children play and dance y'all\nHow dare ya mention you're an MC\nWhen the crowd disagrees on who claim to be\nCause your battle piece are the rhymes you release\nAnd that only make the crowd boos increase\nHey, may I say I'll slay a DJ\nMC who try to defeat me or portray\nOne who claims he gain much respect\nBut in a battle, straight up and down ya getting wrecked\nCauise getting with me is definitely a slaughter\nOr diving in a pool head first without water\nSo don't set yourself up to get brutalized\nThat only happens when you're not energized\nBit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic\nThat I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic\nOka, got it in your head, correct\nThat I'm victorious on any subject\nYou disbelieve, then huh, call the title\nThen after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol\nIt's like..zap...another one on my jock strap\nNow you walk around praising my name\nCause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain\nYou don't have what it takes to be an MC\nYa just phony as ya wanna be", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
