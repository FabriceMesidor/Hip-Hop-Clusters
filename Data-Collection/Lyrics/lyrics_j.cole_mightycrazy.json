(No)\nWhipping niggas like big body Cadillacs\nI'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho\nI could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds\nMatter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that\nNiggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto\nMy whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know\nShit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick\nSurvival's a bitch\nBut everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo\nWherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0\nGod knows I don't put up no facade, no\nNo fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob\nKeep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise\nDisrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh\nFrom the other side, punk-ass nigga\nJump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk\nBlast pop while I pump gas\nSkunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath\nMy niggas will ride all day like a fun pass\nThat's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though\nDon't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho\nI got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful\nYou talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bda451f623edd51bf1dcc17564bd3e70.501x501x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J. Cole"}
