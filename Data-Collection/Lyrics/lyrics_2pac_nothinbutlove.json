(Remember Me)", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStraight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya\nGive a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners\nI remember drinkin' Hennessy, smokin' weed\nFantasize about the things we'd grow to be\nHad a partner named Snupe, loved to clown a stank\nSmoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank\nShootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off\nPour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all\nOoohweee, who popped that coochie best?\nOn my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest\nHavin' house parties in a crowded spot\nAnd you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot\nEverybody wanna dance when the slow jam come\nLookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump\nStraight grindin', everybody havin' fun\nAnd it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun\nCause another dude kicked his Bacardi over\nHe had to act a fool, now the party's over\nGun shots rang like it's thunder\nAnd everybody bum rushin' and I'm rushin' to get a number\nSays she got a man but she's lyin'\nWhy? I seen her talkin' to this other guy and\nHe's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him\nI ain't trippin', I just hope he get 'em, I got nuttin but love\n\n[Hook: Dave & 2Pac]\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours\n\n[Verse 2]\nI love to go back, to the block I got my game from\nAnd pay respect to the place that I came from\nCause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'\nHe'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'\nBut I can't diss him he's my elder\nHe been livin' here longer what that tell ya?\nAnd little girls playin' double dutch\nStill blush, cause she don't get in trouble much\nIt's uhh, ponytails and barrettes\nI gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set\nAnd little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all\nGet out the street before they hit y'all\nAnd as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss\nAnd wonder how we came to this\nI help an old lady across the street, the cost is free\nI can't take what she offers me\nAnd this is how the world could be\nThis is how the world should be\nFeels good to be back on the streets\nCause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love\n\n[Hook: Dave & 2Pac]\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I was young I used to want to be a dealer see\nCause the gold and cars they appealed to me\nI saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks\nAnd the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope\nStarted thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself\nSo I made myself, raised myself\n'Til the dealer on the block told me, \"That ain't cool\nYou ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool\"\nI got my game about women from a prostitute\nAnd way back used to rap on the block for loot\nI tried to make my way legit, haha\nBut it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent\nAnd uhh, it was funny how I copped out\nI couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out\nMy family on welfare\nI'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care\nI'm out here on my own\nAt least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone\nI'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face\nCause my life is filled with hate\nUntil I looked around me\nI saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me\nPanthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs\nHey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love\n\n[Hook: Dave & 2Pac]\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nYeah, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nYeah, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nUhm, nuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya, Yeah!!\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nNuttin but love\nAin't got nuttin but love for yam, Yeah!!\nOaktown\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f924e981b74c6d754d2c9da26f83f15.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
