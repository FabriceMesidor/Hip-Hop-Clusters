Tellin' me\u2005how to do my shit.\n\"You need\u2005do this, you need to do that\"\nWhat the fuck is you talkin' about?\nI been doin' this shit my way since I started this shit.\nThe way I did this shit got my bank account to where it is.\nThe way I did this shit got me to where the fuck I'm at.\nSo I ain't tryna hear none of that shit you talkin' about.\nDon't tell me shit.\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, what you talkin' 'bout?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\n\n[Verse 1]\nLet me tell you somethin'\nIt's everybody's favorite crip cousin, Snoop Dogg\nInductin' these woop hoes as loopholes\nDeath rowin' them blue drawers, bitch niggas\nGood on both sides like switch hitters\nSnitches get stitches, send cliques to get niggas\nFor you to smoke with me cuz, you need 6 figures\nAsk your bitch 'bout the dick, yeah, my shit glitter\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (Huh?)\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\n\n[Verse 2]\n'Cause I done changed so many lives with my vibe\nMade sure my crips and my wroos all survive\nLong Beach throwin' up C's in my stores\nHollywood store, Twin Towers with the boys, nigga\nSwitchin' bitches like I switch cars\nLil' homies on go, and keep the licks for us\nWalkin' in the church, smellin' like a lit forrest\nWe still good 'cause a real one kept the shit goin'\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\n\n[Interlude]\nIt don't stop, it don't stop\n(Makin' this shit)\nWe gon let this shit breathe right here, hold up\n\n[Verse 3]\nI done made so much money, everybody gotta love me\nBut that comes with the game, my nigga, hate it or love it\nSo what we really talkin' 'bout, if we ain't talkin' 'bout\nWhat I'm talkin' 'bout\n'Cause what I'm talkin' 'bout got niggas hella bags\nSophisticated crippin' with the ghetto swag\nThree-piece suit with a black and a yellow rag, tied in a knot\nRollin' down the Laundro got my eyes on the opps\nGot my eyes on the cops, got my eyes on the block\nFresh off stage, rich or broke loco, shit don't change\nWhere I'm from (Long Beach)\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, what you talkin' 'bout? (What?)\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\nIf it ain't what I'm talkin', then why we talkin', nigga?\n\n[Outro]\nFuck outta my face with that shit, man\n(Makin' this shit)\nIt's what we do\nRight on, right on\n(Makin' this shit)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e706b466d23f08adcaee1a620528b010.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
