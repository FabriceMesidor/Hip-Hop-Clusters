(one shot at love..)\nThat's all you get {*sniff*}\n\nJealousy - don't let it interfere\nDon't let it come in between\nThe love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God\nSo merciless and mean\nAnd it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships\nAnd pit two people against, one another\nAnd because of this God, the one you love so much\nWill no longer be your lover\n\nOne shot (one shot at love..)\nAww baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)\nThat's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)\nI mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love..)\nThat's all..\n\nI hope you understand what I just said\nAll I'm sayin is that you only get one shot at love in life\nAnd you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it\nCause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad\nTake it from me\nYou only get one shot, and I mean that\nOne shot\n\nYou only get you only get you only get one (2X)\nOne shot at love..\nYou only get you only get you only get one (2X)\nOne shot at love..\nYou only get you only get you only get one (2X)\nOne shot at love..\nYou only get you only get you only get one (2X)\nOne shot at love.. {*fades*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/35b951a9c90707d0d03de9bebbadefc6.999x999x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
