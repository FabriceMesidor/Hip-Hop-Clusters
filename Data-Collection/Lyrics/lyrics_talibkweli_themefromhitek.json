Time to let go\nHi-Tek, the beats is right beside the soundgarden\nTracks get in the vein like heroin the way heads be noddin\nOfficially, people love our company like they was misery\nI'm known to blast mc's with the cannon of history\nSpecifically the ones who forgot where they come from\nSo it's the light that they run from like roaches\nWhenever the truth approaches\nI attack the track ferocious, never lose my focus\nHold this true hip-hop, closest to my heart, and you know this\nNowadays it's hopeless and my diagnosis\nIs to grab the microphone and be the dopest, you can quote this\nNiggas sound like they injected with collagen\nYou followin these hollow men no honor when\nYou bite off more than you could chew or could be swallowin\nSorry man I ain't got no pity for you to wallow in\nQuit hollerin before you get stomped out with my Solomon's\nAll the way from Lynn Street, to?\nAlways bringin you hot shit, aiyyo we promisin", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/talib-pic.png"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
