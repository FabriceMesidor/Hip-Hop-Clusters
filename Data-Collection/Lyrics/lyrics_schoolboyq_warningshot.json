You silly motherfucker, I'm fire\nSmack the Devil over the cheek\nGave him a third-degree burn\nIced it down the same week and told him, 'You'll be okay'\nA lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day\nThey hydroplanin'\nThey hopin' that they catch they big break\nWhat are you sayin'?\nI feel I'm the one like a magician\nWith a stick inside his hand of a name of a messy cane\nI gets ignorant with you\nSnap your picture, bitch, I'm famous\nI came in this world with nuts in my palm\nAnd drinkin' Paul Masson\nIn a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron\nLocked him in a basement and amputated his shootin' arm\nNow that's a stretch, Ab-Soul\nLike the fifty-mile strip when I'm pimpin' these hoes\nCall me Dolemite, no, I take that back\nFound out he gay as a [inaudible] or the way that they rap\n\n[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]\nI wish I had the very first verse I wrote\nI'd spit it right now\nSo you can see the vast progression and the style\nStarted as a child\nNow I'm a grown man like Benjamin Button in his fifties\nFuck with me\nStill ain't learnt the power of a dollar, disregardin' Fif'\nNot cause I don't like him, just cause I don't save shit\nSo high on my horse\nIf I fall off I get kicked by a hoof 'fore I hit the hood\nAnd that was over they head, but I wish a nigga would\nDisrespect my intellect, I'm a cocky individual\nNo subliminals, try to attack and I'll react like chemicals\nThe doc should've brought him some of my mom's inner tubes\nCause now I'm in the view of millions, takin' interviews\nI got interludes better than your singles\nWon't stop till I got a better reason to [inaudible]\nAnd if any of y'all want a piece of the God\nOn 12/25 we send grief to your squad\nThe only problem I got now is label offers on the table\nLike a table cloth is but I'm cautious\nI'm like what Jaws is to crawfish\nThe big shot, that's why I talk my shit\nThat's why they on my dick\nLike them little tricks that I taught your bitch\nShe'd probably lick it if I unzipped these Dickies\nYou need to quit it, knock it off\nI'm in your girl ear like a cotton swab\nAnd anythin' I say, I'm a blame it on that alcohol\nLike T-Pain on a song with Jamie Foxx\nI'm here cause it's my time, you came to watch\nEvery day it's ceramics class, pass the pot", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/45efd40fd627a8f9c163ec2fd242c8e0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ScHoolboy Q"}
