I\u2019m all for the dough\nIt\u2019s money over hoes, bullet for the skull\nFucked up when you gotta put your dreams on hold\nAnd your homies don\u2019t see the bigger picture like you do\nTrying to navigate to a city that I outgrew\nFuck the world \u2018cause they doubt you\nHear your enemies, but watch them niggas that\u2019s around you\n100 MPH, getting closer to the exit\nHeard you took it off cause I\u2019m on to some next shit\nAm I headed in the right direction?\nOnly God knows, but I count my blessings\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Big Noyd]\nI got the pedal to the metal doing about a 100\nJake in the rearview, sirens going\nRed and blues flashing, life is on high speed\nOnly thing that slow me down this blunt and some good trees\nBut it\u2019s hotter than a pancake\nThat\u2019s life\u2019s struggle, it is what you make it\nBut me I\u2019m about the paper like a ticket\nIt\u2019s all about the dough, fuck the speed limit\nStacking change, stay in your lane\nDon\u2019t rub a neck, keep your eyes on your own thing\nCheck your blind spot before you make moves\nWhether left or right, nigga, watch what you do\nCause a wreck could happen in a sec\nPushing it too hard, you end up in treeyards\nSee me, I stay strapped like a safe-belt\nHe tucked under the seat, that\u2019s how we roll\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nAfter 100 meters, make a U-turn\nThen at the end of the road, Turn right\nAfter 200 meters - sharp left\nThen, you have reached your destination\nYou have reached your destination", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42d069fe8357b9423abc0b46d79ba08d.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
