Shit, I don't remember\n(Two, three, go)\nI know my temperature was set\nYou finally flew south\nThe bird gon\u2019 leave the nest, you're so chromatic\nAt least I had it (Uh)\nInstead of never\nOr maybe I'm too dramatic\n(Two, three, go)\n\n[Chorus: CeeLo Green]\nWhether it\u2019s rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now\nMy love's gone, my love's gone\nMy love's gone, oh, gone\nI guess it wasn't meant to be\nOr maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from\nMy love\u2019s gone, my love\u2019s gone\nMy love's gone, gone\n\n[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]\nGone, gone, gone, gone, gone\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]\nI know love is, is all I got\nI just hope to God she got good taste\nCould put you on some shit you never seen\nCould play a couple songs that you could dance to\nI hope you know she can\u2019t compete with me\n\n[Chorus: CeeLo Green]\nWhether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now\nMy love's gone, my love\u2019s gone\nMy love's gone, oh, gone\nI guess it wasn't meant to be\nOr maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from\nMy love's gone, my love's gone\nMy love's gone, gone\n\n[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]\nYou kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)\nYou kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)\nYou kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)\nGoing, and now I'm scarred for life\n\n[Interlude: CeeLo Green]\nMy love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)\nMy love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone\n\n[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]\nAyo, it's poison in that gumbo\nEmotion, feel Dumbo\nAsk me where my love go\nThat bitch walked outside the front door\nKnock, knock, knock, knock\nI'm not shocked, I brought this on me\nIt's my fault, you gon' leave\nLesson taught, see\nThe weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'\nMy stupid ass brought umbrellas\nI got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better\nNow it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve\nIs drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions\nYou got your thing, I got nothing but memories\nI know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)\nI'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that\nEverybody making a choice according to plan and\nWe had two different blueprints, but understood influence\nYou opened up early on, I thought I had a permit\nYou started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence\nThen my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant\nI'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease\nYou never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it\nBut I finally found peace, so peace\nIt was my fault, I reached\nThat contract got breached\nNow I'm back roaming the streets\nSo peace\n(Want me do it over? Everything)\n\n[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]\nI hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit\nIt really does, it crushes your soul\n\n[Part II: THANK YOU]\n\n[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]\nThank you for the love\nThank you for the joy\nBut I don't ever wanna fall in love again\nThank you for the time\nThank you for your mind, mind\nBut I don't ever wanna fall in love again\n\n[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]\n(Got my eye)\nI said go, go\n\n[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]\nThank you for the love\nThank you for the joy\nBut I don't ever wanna fall in love again\nThank you for the time\nThank you for your mind, mind\nBut I don't ever wanna fall in love again\n\n[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]\nAgain, again\nAgain, again\n(Got my eye)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/610384882ca6311db99de4fbfcdf2b46.421x421x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
