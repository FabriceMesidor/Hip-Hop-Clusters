That\u2019s you\nAnd we\u2019re still at camp as long as we\u2019re on the bus\nAnd not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us\nWe\u2019re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles\nI like you and you like me and I more-than-like you\nBut I don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t more-than-like me\nYou\u2019ve never said, so I haven\u2019t been saying anything all summer\nContent to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me\nAnd choosing to do so again the next day and so on\nA girl who\u2019s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh\nIs willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh\nBut who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be\nA girl who reads books that no one\u2019s assigned to her\nWhose curly brown hair has a line running through it\nFrom where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet\n\nBack in the real world we don\u2019t go to the same school\nAnd unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood\nWe won\u2019t go to the same high school\nSo, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something\nAnd it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something\nThe sun\u2019s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep\nWe\u2019re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop\nThat looks like a kid we know\nAnd then I\u2019m like, \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\nAnd all of a sudden I\u2019m telling you\nAnd I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming\nAnd your face is there and gone and there and gone\nAs we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway\nAnd there\u2019s no expression on it\nAnd I think just after a point I\u2019m just talking to lengthen the time\nWhere we live in a world where you haven\u2019t said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d yet\nAnd regrettably I end up using the word \u201cdestiny\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember in what context. Doesn\u2019t really matter\nBefore long I\u2019m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \u201cokay\u201d\nI don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive\nAnd I would leave in order not to spoil the moment\nBut there\u2019s nowhere to go because we\u2019re on a bus\nSo I pretend like I\u2019m asleep and before long, I really am\n\nI wake up, the bus isn\u2019t moving anymore\nThe domed lights that line the center aisle are all on\nI turn and you\u2019re not there\nThen again a lot of kids aren\u2019t in their seats anymore\nWe\u2019re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church\nThe bus is half empty. You might be in your dad\u2019s car by now\nYour bags and things piled high in the trunk\nThe girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time\nDisembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus\nJust as one of them reaches my row\nIt used to be our row, on our way off\nIt\u2019s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week\nAfter throwing rocks at my head\nAdolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise\nShe stops and looks down at me\nAnd her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can\u2019t really see her face\nBut I can see her smile. And she says one word: \u201cdestiny\u201d\nThen her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh\nAnd then she turns and leads them off the bus\nI didn\u2019t know you were friends with them\n\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over\nSo is summer, even though there\u2019s two weeks until school starts\nThis isn\u2019t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad\nThis is a story about how I learned something and I\u2019m not saying this thing is true or not\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s what I learned\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody\nSo I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always\nEverybody can\u2019t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them\nBut this means there isn\u2019t a place in my life for you or someone like you\nIs it sad? Sure. But it\u2019s a sadness I chose\nI wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy\nAnd got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit\nBut that\u2019s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus\nI still haven\u2019t", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00196af444633a4108e6dc544358985e.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
