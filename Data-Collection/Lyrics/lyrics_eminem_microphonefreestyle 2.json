My ass\nHe's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater\nYou're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass\nHe's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing\nMyself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing\nWith or without clothing, next to the decomposing\nBodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing\nWindows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing\nI think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine\nI was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing\nI'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring\nI need a drink, I'm standing over the sink hosing\nMyself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly\nI don't wanna think; this will make everything rosy\nBeverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies\nTotally frozen while I close in\nI'm yodelling \"Rosie, won't you come out to play?\"\nAnd no sense wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines\nIn the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers\nMy words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends\nGo to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em\nYou never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him\nThe neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than\nThe kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'\nEighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins\nCrazy turn of events  that he emerged\nTook over the world and reeled in all the children\nLured 'em into the building and killed 'em\nBuried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels\nAnd still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin\nCotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills\nThe Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'\nThere's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch\nMildred, he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed\nThere's no one as sick as he, MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
