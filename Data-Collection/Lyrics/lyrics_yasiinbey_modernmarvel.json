Ha!\n\nUnderstand this is real life..\nThis how it goes on, this how it goes on...\nIt keep going on, this how it goes on...\nGhetto people look alive, get free\nGet involved, remain to breathe...Ha! Wooh!\n\nIf Marvin was alive now, wow..\nWhat would I say to him?\nWhere could I start?\nHow could I explain to him??\nI know the minor world would probably look strange to him\nWould he feel like today had a place for him?\nGlobal imprisonment, sickness, indifference\nWhen he said, \"Save the babies,\" was we listenin?\nWhen he said, \"Mercy, mercy,\" did he really know..\nThat decades later we'd still be killin folks?\nOr did he hope that we would realize..\nThat we the first, the son of earth..\nThe moon and stars, the great beyond..\nWe black and proud, we brave and strong..\nWe raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh..\nAnd keepin on..?\n\nHa! Ghetto people look alive and free, ya get real..\nThis how it goes on, and you say you say\nThis how it goes on, and you say you say\nThis how it goes on..\nGhetto people look alive and free and breathe! Ha!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Got the beat!\n\nThere ain't nothin to be afraid of..\nGhetto people look alive and free, ya get real...\nThis how it goes on\nThis how it goes on, keep goin on..\nThis how it goes on\nNow breathe!\nMarvelous, marvelous, marvelous, Marvin Modern Marvel...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/338419572381e746b5f1aa0866d2d857.596x596x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
