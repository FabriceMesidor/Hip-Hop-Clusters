I'd say heroism\nWe are the dauntless in the midst of demons, we see in swarms\nSo mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed\nI learned to love from my mother\nI feel an angel around me, I know she hovers\nImpatiently waitin' for you to discover\nThat people all need each other\nWhen you see me, I'll call you brother\nNever mattered, whatever color\n\n[Chorus: Jordan Omley]\nNo, we won't go quietly\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\nWe should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\nBut we won't go quietly\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\nWe should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\nBut we won't go quietly\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nAnd everybody say, \"No, we won't go quietly\"\nNo, we won't go quietly\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nIf we didn't fear each other, we could stand near each other\nStrange Music\nYa Bwi!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9512e7de485fe45a8b0365fd80465887.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
