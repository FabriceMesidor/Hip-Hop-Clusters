Du Bois\nIf you see me pull up in the bubble you greet me with noise\nKeep your poise, but really you wanna see me destroyed\nAcronym for me is D.O.C., I'm the O.G\nDestroyin' all competition that's in my way because I'm G-O-D\nYou amount to nothin' if in my circumference or area\nThe Sagittarius in the Age of Aquarius\nYou act like you ain't know the veteran can go\nAnd I be killin' them, in some instances better than befo'\nThen I got ahh, crooked letter to the O\nSeverin' your throat, now they like \"Who let him in the do'?\"\nNo matter how you Google it then doodle it\nWhat'll really make you the shit is how I see you make use of it\nCrucifix and holy water won't stop the way he get\nSo crazy and sick, evil like I took a sip of Damian's fifth\nOff Canadian's mist, Arabian piss, a Ukranian's fist\nSpit so nice they be like \"It's an alien's gift\"\nYou pay me in bricks and I'mma show you a way we can flip\nOr I'm clappin' like \"What Happened to That Boy\" like Baby and Clipse\nCome talkin' shit 'bout what you do I'll bet you be the first\nThat might come up missin', I'll make sure that you don't need a hearse\nI'm on a mission, don't come through unless you bring in work\nI'm dissin', ammunition I'mma shoot until my fingers hurt\nThen I'mma shoot some more if I can squeeze\n'Cause you borin' while I'm soarin' like I'm Thor or Socrates\nWar as I conceive that the breath of horror I can breathe\nEven though you servin' defense I be scorin', droppin' threes\nAll in my grill-y like you can throw them thangs\nI'm insane while you prefer Novocain over pain\nFor talkin' shit tonight my bitch'll blow your brains\n'Cause he thought the weakness was kryptonite, it was Lois Lane\nI boss you like a parent apparently darin' ya\nScarin' ya if you're there when I get to airin' the derringer\nThe mini-carrier that's knockin' down your barrier\nBury ya, expose 'em like I threw a flare in your area\nCarry your body off to the woods and get rid of it\nYou're rottin' while I go get some pot and then take a hit of it\nThen I'mma try to come up with some different shit\nWhile I'm draggin', like if rap was a dragon I am the spit of it\nTwista", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22947d4f60e8349895bb1529f74a6530.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
