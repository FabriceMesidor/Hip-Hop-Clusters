So am I\nSo could we see eye to eye?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou must let go of that mind control that's coming out your television and radio\nYou must escape (say what) escape from here\nGet intelligent when you hit that shit and let it go (blow)\nFar from here, let it go (just blow)\nLet it go\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's DTF cause she's down to feel\nThat aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real\nAre you a freak, or what?\nI'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut\nYou crack me up\nAre you a freak? So am I\nSo could we see eye to eye?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou try to survive, you're under pressure cause you're running outta time\nBut this is not a chance you wanna blow, cause we gotta go\nThe deal is murder, you think long, you've been wrong, get it out your mind\nMake you move when you hear them screaming oh, cause I gotta go\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's DTF cause she's down to feel\nThat aromatic, now unlock it baby this is for real\nAre you a freak, or what?\nI'm just a squirrel tryna get a nut\nYou crack me up\nAre you a freak? So am I\nSo could we see eye to eye?\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy don't you sway, sway side to side?\nDip, dip, glide and glide\nSway, sway side to side\nDip, dip, do it one more time\nWhy don't you sway, sway side to side?\nDip, dip, glide and glide\nSway, sway side to side\nDip, dip, baby let that ride", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b70a8dcc62d2fed742fc6406b5d60520.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
