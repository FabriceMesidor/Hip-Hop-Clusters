When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together? Language. \"This world will become one, I have found the way. Race, tribal affiliations, national borders - even our faces will be irrelevant. The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again\n\n[Verse 2]\nFound a friend in the words and my words and it works\nTake away the pain, take away the hurt\nMake a way to make a change, make it sane\nSpecially if you plan on staying on this Earth\nLow to the lows, high to the highs\nEyes to the sky, strive to revive, dying to survive\nPool full of cries but it's cool, I'm still alive\nAnd every breath is every left soul\nAnd the family never kept whole\nIn the slum, want to quest to be the best of being less\nNever let go, the best road to the next level\nAnd the scenes where it's mean to do the right thing\nNot to be a good king but the best devil\nSo it's horns for the crown, torn from the ground\nRoses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days\nLook at them rain down\nI was brought here a slave\nBut I leave here a pharaoh\n\n[Interlude]\nAmerica is a country of liberty, a meeting of immigrants\nInstead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others\nSo the major sought a system that used information\nWords to control the subconscious\nIn his eyes, the greatest symbiotic parasite the world's ever known isn't microbial -- it's linguistic\nWords is what keep civilization, our world, alive\n\n[Outro]\nIf you are what you say you are, the coolest\nWon't you just shine down?\nYou are what you say you are, the coolest\nWon't you just shine down?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bef4cf108208bb4604a6547581b0aaf0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
