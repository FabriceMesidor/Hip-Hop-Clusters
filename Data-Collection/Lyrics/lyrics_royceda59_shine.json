I'm highly insulted\nThis is Royce da 5'9\", mind body and soul shit\nAll I have in this fucking globe is my shotty and flow\nI'd rather let the coroner outline my body in chalk\nThan let the fans order me 'round the clock and buy me in bulk\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm out here trapping\nWith this here sincere rapping\nI've been shooting straight\nSince two inch tape\nThis is for real classic\nAnd getting money was never part of my goals\nIt just came along with me shining my light on them hoes\nI've been out here trapping\nWith this here sincere rap\nFor fifteen years, I ain't leaving here without a classic\nI get money, get money money dough\nAll I came to do is shine my light on them hoes\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe move in silence, y'all ain't hearing us coming\nI was sent by God to provide that imperial sonnage\nYa'll assembly line of rhymers really don't want it\nI'll eat you for breakfast, one by one I got ya'll serial numbers\nI'm about to send a tweet out to my nigga Styles\nTell him he got the juice now\nCall my OG Scarface, talk some boxing with him\nPerhaps these new clowns, politic perhaps\nAbout a new him and Royce track\nI'm feeling like D to the O to the C\nWhen he got his voice back\nHa, I'm feeling like Cube in a fresh El Camino\nRolling key low g rolling through Detroit's back\nStreets waving to all my people\nI'm feeling more at home than Reese Taylor\nThis are what memories are made of\nI remember each grudge, each favor\nEach lie, each judge, each bailiff\nEach job, cheap labor\nEach neighbor, each caper\nEach Mosque, each Church\nEach pastor, pew, and casket\nEach future bastard double dutching  through the madness, singing:\n\n[Outro]\nJust shine your light on the world\nSo shine your light on the world\nNo matter anywhere you go, kid\nShining your light on the world\nDon't let the money make you thirsty\nDon't even let it be your goal\nJust let it come and keep on working\nAnd shine your light on the hoes\nCause I'm the hardest nigga out here\nI'd rather die than live a life of fear\nI know I got to be down here\nTo shine my light on them hoes\nHardest nigga out here\nI'd rather starve than live a life of fear\nI feel like God sent me down here\nTo shine my light on them hoes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/533ac062d389201c4e7eb9a973709ea4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
