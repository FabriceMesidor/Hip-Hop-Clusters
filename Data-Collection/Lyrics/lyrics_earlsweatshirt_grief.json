Get dude turned to dinner quick\nYou circus niggas, you turning into tricks\nI was making waves, you was surfing in 'em\nDealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit\nCut the grass off the surface\nPray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent nigga's shit\nBitch\n\n[Hook]\nGood grief, I been reaping what I sowed\nNigga, I ain't been outside in a minute\nI been living what I wrote\nAnd all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas\nMomma taught me how to read 'em when I look\nMiss me at the precinct getting booked\nFishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks\nSay you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy fleeting thoughts on a leash\nFor the moment, high as fuck\nI've been alone in my shit, for the longest\nSnakes sliding in the street\nMomma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them\nPigs, riding in 'em\nI'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em\nIf he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him\nThere's no time for that\nMaking sure my man wallet's straight\nLike a collar when you iron that\nThinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle\nI'mma wallow when I lie in that\nI just want my time and my mind intact\nWhen they both gone, you can't buy 'em back\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d86975ce40bd3532a1cb2b1c341d5537.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
