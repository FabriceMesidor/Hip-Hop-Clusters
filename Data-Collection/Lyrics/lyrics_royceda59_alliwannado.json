Niggas don't even deserve to breathe\nHow the fuck is you servin me?\nI'm the nigga with the pump ready to dump all nine shots\nUntil your body turn burgundy - want war nigga?\nYou don't wanna fuck with this, what's all of this\nYou might as well un-ball your fist\nYou think the real niggas fight with fists?\nLet me be the first to tell you that it's all a myth\nI ain't playin with y'all niggas, it ain't a game\nReal niggas recognize the real\nSo when I aim, I aim to hit\nAnd I came to spit shit you feel\nFeel this (feel me)\n\n[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs\n\n[Outro]\nWhat wh-wh-what what what, nigga {\u200b15X}\u200b\nWhat, nigga, what, nigga\nWhat wh-wh-what what what, nigga!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d86b45b993cdf0c53559e740521a4bba.500x494x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
