We had the champagne in the studio, of course\u2014compliments of the company\u2014and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last\u2014all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...\n\n[Chorus: Timbaland]\nCash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik\nC.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the\nGet the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar\nD-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill y'all (y'all, y'all)\nCash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik\nC.R.E.A.M.;
