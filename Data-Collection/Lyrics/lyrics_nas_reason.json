Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife\nHe's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night\nLittle bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz\nIn her pad while she slept\nThey said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister\nNigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next\n\n[Hook: Emily]\n\nEmily harmonizes as Nas talks:\n\"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what\nTry to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they\nKids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there\nTo all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what\nTryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah\nLadies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what\nWe do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and\nShit. Just man... man.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65c98702fc773f6dafd41563fe5c5485.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
