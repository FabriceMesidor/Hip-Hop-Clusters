Asking for that was my first mistake\nIn my hotel room my heart you'll break\nLay me on the bed and my soul you'll take\nShake that ass, earth that quake\nFinish it all leave it on your face\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me take your number down\nI'm a little too high right now\nI've been drinking I've been smoking all night\nBaby I ain't tryna chase you down\nLet me take your number down\nI'm a little fucked up right now\nI've been drinking smoking all damn night\nBaby I ain't gonna chase you down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah my head's kinda fucked right now\nBut I'm still tryna fuck right now\nLet me take your number down baby\nYou make me calm down baby\nCome over right now baby\nTurn all the lights out baby\nLove me down baby\nI'm off the ground baby\nWhen you're around\nYou turn my frown upside down baby\nFucked up right now\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me take your number down\nI'm a little too high right now\nI've been drinking I've been smoking all night\nBaby I ain't tryna chase you down\nLet me take your number down\nI'm a little fucked up right now\nI've been drinking smoking all damn night\nBaby I ain't gonna chase you down (yeah yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nBitch I am off of the ground\nBark at that bitch I'm a hound\nL-O-L catch me laughing out loud\nGet so high when I'm off of the ground", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
