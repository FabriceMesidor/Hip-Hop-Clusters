I'll squeeze you juiceless\nCatch you, hang you from many nooses\nBeen the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless\nYoung and I'm ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one guns, shottys thats looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops\nLazer-in on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch you's a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten\nBullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god\nCount your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin\nCannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do\nWhenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck\nI'm kurupted!\n\nI'm kurupted!\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it\nAt the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)\nBlunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance\nPractice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit\nWorthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT\nQuick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A.S.A.P\nComplete havoc, compulsive disorder, rhyme addict -- Slaughter\nHouse is full of Joey, Joells and Royces for ya'\nLive from the area code of Three-One-Oh, laughin' all the way to the bank with three Elmos\nThree six-fo's, One bottle of Goose, I'm the truth, you could put your hand on the bible and shoot\nI'm Kurupted!\n\n[Outro]\nSee a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends\nWest Coast legends, Young Gotti\n\nI black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory.
