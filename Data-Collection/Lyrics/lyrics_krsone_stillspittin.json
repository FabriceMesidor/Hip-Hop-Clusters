Word\nKnowledge Reigns Supreme, Over Nearly Everyone\nWhen you gon' get it? Aww man\n\n[Verse 1: KRS-One]\nWatch how I spit 'em, watch how I hit 'em\nInebriated rhythm, we get up all in 'em\nKRS you gotta get him, we the best we always win 'em\nThem cats won't admit I'm in the club rippin they shit\nI'm raw when I'm on tour you better be sure when you get 'em\n'Til you hit the floor and spin 'em, them elements do you live 'em?\nOr are you just usin 'em, confusin 'em and killin them\nYour touring is boring, your minimum ain't fulfillin them\nSo let's start drillin 'em, why we ain't feelin them\nCause we lookin and lookin and don't see that real in them\nCars we be wheelin them, minds we be healin them\nWith books and CD's, believe me we straight dealin them\nLive in the club them thugs hit the ceiling\nWhen they get the feeling KRS-One start delivering\nSo who's up? (Akbar) You live hip-hop?\nYo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got\n\n[Verse 2: Akbar]\nThis whole rap game is a gamble, some MC's can't handle\nFinancial freeze, your record company's at a standstill\nWhile I breeze through a sample, and lead by example\nFind fertile minds and drop seeds by the handful\nMan you ain't gotta hit me in my head with the anvil\nI grow wise, I recognize the lies and the scandal\nOnce you sign on that line, your career could depend on\nThese white collar crooks who cook the books like Enron\nSo I took an oath to speak no lie\nWhile mad rappers die over beef like E. Coli\nI guess you thugs won't get the picture until them slugs hit ya\nI ain't a hater, but sooner or later \"Love's Gonna Get 'Cha\"\nAnd if you don't know that, then you dumb fella\nAnd everything I said, went right over your head, like an umbrella\nSo who's up? (L) You live hip-hop? (Damn right)\nYo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got\n\n[Verse 3: L Da Headtoucha]\nCategorize me with the best clique, rhyme majestic\nWith it I get sick and mo' connected\nSo electric my energy is remembered I'm limitless\nMy mind screamin just against the rhythm, intense is the ism\nIn 'em I long salute the young and hungry to shine\nNightmares of lost time haunt taunt me to rhyme\nBeen isolated, waitin years to finally reappear\nCheers I made it, all praise due, Inebriated\nThese words are weaponry, huh, mental telepathy\nRocks for definite, reppin it, 'til the death of me\nPain left in me runs deep, and leaks through the speakers\nIn Jeeps and tape decks, then connects to your peeps\nWe keep it, thorough borough to borough, city to ghetto\nRock like, heavy mental on the, instrumental\nSo who's up? (Illin') You live hip-hop?\nGet on the mic and give it what you got\n\n[Verse 3: Illin' P]\nI got five on it, you want it, flaunt it without hesi-\nDues paid check the rezzy, the black film be\nThat of a blunt's ashpassed via the spectacular cast\nTo get at the mass and choose sets, listen\nI rep even when I be fingerin 'em, get it, probably not\nProbably thought I meant that snitch talk\nStarvin your brain, I never come with the simple and plain\nTo get at these thoughts, get on the train of\nCome mek mi learn ya bwoy, you nah fi toy wit de sum'n\nMicrophone check one, no frontin\nYou niggas is mimin your rhymes cause y'all ain't sayin nuttin\nSo mi dust off mi foot bottom pon unuh mat\nCause fi mi good will stay huntin'\nFi a new day, mon, unuh fi wake up\nIndustry fi get shake up\nMarried to the ghetto you niggas fi get break up\nAhh so who live hip-hop\nUpon de hip, me ride the Soul Train ock\n\n[Verse 4: Supastition]\nYo I'm not to be confused with these popular new names\nI been paid my dues I'm at the top of the food chain\nAnd I should get an award for slept on peeps\nSo this beat'll be perfect for my acceptance speech\nForever loved in your city, thanks to rap\nMy album's a continuous seller like fitted Yankee caps\nI'm like a demon, crossbred with a ragin bull\nI'm from the South but I relate more to \"Paid in Full\"\nSo focused on my grind, I'm potent when I rhyme\nTell niggas close your fuckin mouth and open up your mind\nIt takes more than a few weeks to learn\nI make sure rappers and microphones ain't on speakin terms\nAs far as you concerned, I'm losin my temper and patience\nNobody takes shit serious like an impotent rapist\nSo who's up?

(True dat, true dat)\nYo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got\n\n[Verse 5: An Ion]\nI'm aggressive, progressive, words young ticker be vital\nRip the game and the name to reclaim any taken title\nDirectly hand out stares to the needle as it rotates\nAn agent to decrepit from rigormortis in flow eighths\nNot even for a minute can you rap\nLet down by the sound that drowns the clowns even dare to step\nDon't ride the rhythm, I order you to jock\nYour claim to fame was holdin down but you can't hold cock\nDamn right we can fight, I stay with grudge\nWith no prior budge from the previous\nAnd when is it that fourth'll crack cranium, kids come in the picture\nKnowin that asshole and Ion and you ain't the perfect mixture\nLike Alice, diners become the impeccable haven\nThat any enter my zone must be stripped down and shaven\nI stand before you as a fiendish critter\nCreatin causin collision with a pen\nWritten that hatred of spaced-out squashed men like it was a sin\nThe only job payin me enough to snuff the rough\nShould have never planned the plan to make you perish\nLeavin your fan and your uncle and son with somethin he can cherish", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f300314f4b269cd7479d10c0e1cab7e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
