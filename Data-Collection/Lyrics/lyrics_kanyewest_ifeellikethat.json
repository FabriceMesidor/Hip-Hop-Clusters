{"songs": [{"title": "I Feel Like That", "album": null, "year": "2015-07-24", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWhile you're fast asleep\n\n[Verse 1]\nDo you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel like this\nI feel like this\nI feel like that\nI feel like this all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time\nI feel like that\nI feel like that\nI feel like that all the time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
