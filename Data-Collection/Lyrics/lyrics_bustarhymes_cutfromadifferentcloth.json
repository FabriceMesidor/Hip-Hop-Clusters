(wait wait wait) hold on! Let me continue to get you to the to grow on\nBeing that most of you lack the ability to make hits or so on\nGuess whos back the powerful impact\nSoon as I drop people wanna go run out in the streets and get dat\nAnd run right back to they truck and bust off the rappers sick from how I spit dat\nSo appreciate it now people made it this thing I do seem like its the greatest\nFrom a thought that was created successfully forced through all of the hatred\nBy givin you that special music that bring the heart of the now and the sequal\nThe soul of the hood and the votes of the people\nThe streets be the range and my bran while I struggle to keep a balance and equal\nBy givin yall bangers that everybody gon' love\nWe gotta master this, just had to captivate him and make him throw up\nNiggas rilin from stadiums to low clubs\nSee when I come and make my return I school you niggas\nObtaining that information you need to come and just study my statements\nNo replies, just identify me as one of the greatest, the greatest, the greatest\n\n[hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54314abfbbbf16253d72455428cc44e6.834x834x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
