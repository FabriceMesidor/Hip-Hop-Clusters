Disappear, God make an out!\n\n[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]\nNow, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall\nThe lights go off\nSay its going to be, alright\nIts going to be, alright\nCause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall\nThe lights go off\nSay its going to be, alright\nIts going to be, alright\n\nJust tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be\nTell me it'll be, tell me it'll be\nTell me it'll be, tell me it'll be\nTell me it'll be, tell me it'll be\n\n[Outro: James Fauntleroy]\nStay close to me, so close to me\nThat's how it's supposed to be\nLong as you've been knowing me\nYou been holding me down\nI'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully\nI watch over you, you watch over me\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be\nAnd we are, alright\nAnd we are, alright\nAnd we are, alright", "image": "https://images.genius.com/27fece6af1c9ca0717550d393fff7409.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
