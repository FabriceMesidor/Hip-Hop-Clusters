I ain't even exhausted\nYou can call me sick, you can even call me nauseous\nA sea of great whites, you are a dolphin\nIf I was you, I would be a little more cautious\nI'm way too high for you to look at\nThe future ain't lookin' promising for these rookies\nThis is target practice but I don't even pull the fucking trigger anymore\nCause it's just a waste of bullets\nCome and get these pussies, wipe them off the flo'\nI'm guessing they was hoping for some different results\nI'm guessing they was guessing cause they wasn't really sure\nBut fuck it, I guess I'mma have to let these niggas know\nSo I think it's time for these haters to get off my dick\nGot my own city, you can call it Bobtropolis\nEast side representers reppin' with authority\nAnd I ain't talking congressmen and I ain't talking politics\nLookin' for freaks, freaks lookin' for sausages\nBut we already know that, so that is all to get\nCheck the name tag, you know who the roster is\nATL brand, Hustle H.A.M squad in this bitch\nLike I ain't never had a mic\nFresh to death, I see you in the afterlife\nI eat bars, eat beats for my appetite\nYou wouldn't know about that, you never had a bite\nWhat I gotta do to get some solidarity?\nApparently, I need to speak with some more clarity\nNo luck needed, know no charity\nAnd I'mma grown man, don't need pussy to take care of me\nB to the O, I said it once befo'\nIf I ain't on your channel, go and look for the remote\nAlready graduated, yeah, you see the cap and robe\nBut now you couldn't see me 'less you had a telescope\nI'm Bedrock bumpin', three strikes sumpin\nCall me Jack-o-Lantern, I get head like pumpkins\nIt's nothin', roll up the stuffin'\nPut it in the oven, get baked like muffins\nIf you ain't know, I guess I have to introduce ya\nTo my side of town, somethin' you ain't really used to\nBody blow, uppercut, I do more than bruise ya\nKeep fuckin' with me and you ain't gon' have no future", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a78f31032d895aca13cd42cb8a1bac9f.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
