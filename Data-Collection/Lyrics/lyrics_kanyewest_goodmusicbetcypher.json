who the fuck up in here\nCommon, Don, Old G, battle rap, oh\nThat niggas know you can\u2019t really fuck with that\nPusha T, the Clipse just made a classic\nGood music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic\nRamadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting\nBig Sean is a don\nCyhi Da Prynce\nWhy you so nervous dog stop being tense\nIf you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common\nFuck that and thats just common sense\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nCame in the game, 8 years prior\n8 years later, your mans on fire\nMy Book of Eli, to all my subscribers\nPlay the two doors, street car named desire\nCame in Grindin\u2019, Ye\u2019 came Through the Wire\nMet at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired\n1st of the month, Trump to the buyers\nRed Toup\u00e9e on the coupe you've been fired\nSmooth criminal, no prior\u2019s\nMan in the mirror, check no liar\nStill let that \"butter fly\" like Mariah\nShow me the money the black Jerry MaGuire\nTom Cruise on that couch if that money right\nWest Hollywood feels like a bunny night\nWith GOOD company and better jewelers\nTo the Good Life, we GOOD music\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nMan, I wake up to a wet dream\nEvery day\u2019s a Friday and every nights a sex scene\nEvery week is fashion week and every day I\u2019m pressed clean\nDetroit\u2019s Angel, I even got red wings\nI\u2019m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens\nMy life\u2019s prom night and guess who\u2019s the Prom King\nThey having a kissing fight and I\u2019m Don King\nEverybody know I\u2019m coming soon like LeBron\u2019s ring\nI\u2019m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter\nSean Combs and Connery all in one\nWhoever told you sky\u2019s the limit is looking dumb\nCause I\u2019m 22 and I\u2019m moonwalking on the sun\nOh thats your girl?\nShe feelin on my \"whoa there!\", right next to a couple boaters\nAnd she tryna motor boat her\nAnd im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor\nYou might find banana clips \u2019cause it\u2019s Guerilla warfare\nLast year I was watching this from the couch\nAnd now I\u2019m here\nThat should let you know what I\u2019m about\nReaper black suit cuz my whole team\u2019s killing\nHad to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin\nMany tell me I\u2019m the man I ain't made it yet\nTell me who the baddest, I\u2019ll see if I seen them naked yet\nWon\u2019t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet\n\n[Verse 3: Cyhi Da Prince]\nI\u2019m Mr Got bread like Quizno\u2019s\nBetter known as MJ with the big nose\nI swear your artist couldn\u2019t see me on his tip toes\nOnly on TV I gotta take a quick pose\nLet me stop I forgot this was a big show\nAnd being dope made you broke I am piss poor\nI\u2019m big poppa plus I\u2019m 2pacalypto\nMy mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for\nHuh, I\u2019m doing this for hip hop\nIm coming after you, him and his spot\nStill tied to the streets like a hitch knot\nAin't nothing fake, I\u2019m not a Rolly with a tick tock\nAtlanta repper in the home of the Yankee\nRose wood suit on with the hanky\nI got rich from the zones of the stanky\nSo everybody know my money long, lanky!\nSo I\u2019m flexible stretching out my decimel\u2019s\nSwitching up the flow got the crowd going testicles\nCan\u2019t bleep it out cuz there wasn\u2019t nothing sexual\nI\u2019m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels\nI\u2019m impeccable they put me on the pedestal\nAnd if you bite me, it\u2019s good for you like a vegatable\nShows by the several, schedule full of festivals\nAnd if I ever do time than you know its federal\nUh, incredible, yeah\n\n[Verse 4: Common]\nF-f-fam fam fam I\u2019ma monster too\nYou don\u2019t see I do things that the monsters do\nThe incomparable, remarkable, articles\nAbout my audio technique, my technique\nI recognise games like the ESPY\u2019s\nCold to myself I say God Bless me the truth\nSo I speak live and directly\nYou, I will set free my mic is where my check be\nRah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro\nProlly in the metro just so I can get dough\nThe name is Common but the frame is special\nLeave requested from the years I\u2019ve invested\nArrested, develop, addressed it, envelope\nThe body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley\nGo home or go hard, at home is life hardly\n\n[Verse 5: Kanye West]\nThe plan was to drink till the pain over\nWhat\u2019s worse, the pain or the hangover?\nFresh air rolling down the window\nToo many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow\nI sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal\nLeast it came with a few toys like a happy meal\nThis game you could never win\nCause they love you then they hate you then they love you again\nGet away from me loneliness\nGet away from me misery\nGet away from me fake shit, I can\u2019t take the phoniness\nGet away from me wack tracks\nI can only make only hits\nI\u2019m an only child lost in the World\nWhere did the lonely kids go when the bell ring\nFeeling like hell rings\nBringing me back down\nChecking my background\nIts ironic whats happening\nImagine if I didn\u2019t have the ends\nI wouldn't have so many imaginary friends\nI\u2019m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk\nWonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk\nI swear to momma wish me and my father talk more\nI stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore\nI guess everything I hate about me I see in him\nAnd I ain't finna change, so we\u2019ll never agree again\nJust a few things pouring out my soul\nRosewood we could see her with our eyes
