I got a heart the size of Arkansas\nCount to five, these birds gon' hit the ground and they ain't from out the sky\nWent from having an outta-this-world-flow, to doing a video doing the coon dance\nTo watching' my good friend Eminem winning' a moonman\nI remember cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit\nLetting 'em stay with me, long story short, they tore up my corporate apartment\nWent from being a kid addicted to basketball\nTo being an ignorant nigga addicted to alcohol\nRound and round we go is how this movie would end\nSelf-proclaimed King of my city, not really just truly the King of losing a friend\nWho woulda thought this dude in the park who's true to his art would lose\nOr win just by giving his thoughts and views\n\n[Chorus]\nI have tried in vain, never had success\nSo it seems my life is nothing but a mess\nI have lost, my only friends\nNow it seems I have to start again, merry go around\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou would hear that Ryan's skilled might even hear Ryan kills\nYou will never hear Ryan Stills, here to put the \"i\" in ill\nMy mind is still like a merry-go-round spill\nLike leaving only guns to my kids when I'm killed, I got an iron will\nIntellect of Zion, I done went too high on pills\nTo triumph, to hiding from bills, to buying buildings\nThen I went from writing for Dre to wondering if my head was on straight\nOn the sidelines feeling forgot about listening to \"Forgot About Dre\"\nFrom there I went to about a bottle a day\nTelling who we know \"Get outta my face!\" okay I know what Kino said about Dre\nI look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake\nBut if it wasn't for him doing that, what would I be doing today?\nIf it wasn't for Cashis saying that he gonna beat my ass\nThen me and Em probably wouldn't be laughing 'bout us getting past it\nIf it wasn't for me being outcasted I woulda never been on the underground rapping with SLAUGHTERHOUSE!\n\n[Chorus]\nI have tried in vain, never had success\nSo it seems my life is nothing but a mess\nI have lost, my only friends\nNow it seems I have to start again, merry go around", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ef2ea2d0242f3b7c5b03da3554a04b1.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
