And if you don't then ponder\nHold up, pow-pow, there's a reminder\nI ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna\nI sweat money, and the bank is my shower\nHaha, and that pistol is my towel\nHaha, so stop sweating me coward\nAnd I would, die for ours\nRide for hours, supply the flowers\nThis is history in the making\nNow shut the fuck up and let me make it\n\n[Chorus: D. Smith & (Lil Wayne)]\nPlease don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying\nI'm flying, I'm higher\nPlease don't shoot me down\n'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher\n(I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now\nSo am I, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI spit Alcatraz bars, I know\nAnd D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know\nGot a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home\nNo more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket\nBitch I'm grown, fuck what you on\nNow watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne\nAnd if I jump, I'mma fly and look into the eagle's eye\nAnd see I am nothing like you, why?\nBitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me\nAnd if you shootin' for the stars then just shoot me\nBut your bullets don't reach Mars\nPaws, claws, because, I'm a beast, I'm a dog\nI'll getcha, my picture should be in the dictionary\nNext to the definition of \"Definition\"\nBecause repetition is the father of learnin'\nAnd son, I know your barrel burnin', but\n\n[Chorus: D.

I'm a bastard!\nAnd I'ma do it again, like nigga backwards\nThese niggas backwards, but they behind us\nNow watch me get high like time's up\nNah D, bring the drums back\nAnd watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that\nI get respect 'cause if I don't I'mma take it\nI see your boys hatin' and I see your girls naked\nDrum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb\nThen I pop another clip in, and aim at his vision\n'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission\nI'm aiming at a mirror\n\n[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]\nPlease don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying\nI'm flying, I'm higher\nAnd I've done it before\nPlease don't make me do it no more\nPlease don't shoot me down\n'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher\nWatch me soar\nWhere the fuck is my guitar? Now roar\nOhhhhhhhhhh\nPlease don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying\nI'm flying, I'm higher", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70a7ef69242915a9cd1c3f68031e4c0a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
