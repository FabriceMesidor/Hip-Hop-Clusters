I need it sorry, you don't need it more than me\nAnd bitch, I'm tired of this struggle, ducking and dodging them puddles\nWondering if God ever hear the prayers I said\nCause every time I got a new hustle, that shit done got me in trouble\nYou don't know how many fucking tears I've shed\nBut fuck it, I'm letting loose, and they told me don't bend the rules\nThis is my winter blues, you know what I'm finna do\nAnything necessary to make it up in the news\nAnd I'm taking every muthafucking thing that I pick and choose\nAnd I'm done with all the begging, I'm past that, all I did was get laughed at\nYou can go back track but you'll never get cash back\nAnd they told me I'm half black, but I'm white as a lab rat\nWith a mic and a gas mask, I'm a light for your trash ass\nAnd I might get the last laugh, better fight if you back stab\nWith a knife in your backpack, all my life I've been jabbed at\nBut I fight like I'm Mad Max with a knife with the yeah yeah\nYou know, you know what the fuck I'm talking about\n\n[Bridge]\nListen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings\nYou don't have any idea just what I had to do to get what I want\nAll I wanted was to make a decent living\nI can't even count it on my fingers how much shit that I lost\nWoo, nigga this is my job\nYeah, these are my thoughts\nWoo, I ain't never had shit\nBut for now you better give me what's yours\n\n[Chorus]\nDamn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit\nWhat's a man to do when he's out of options\nI ain't wanna do it but this\n(Shhh, hold on, be quiet, they're coming)\nOh no no no no no no\nOh no no no no no no\nOh no no no no no no\nNo no no no no no\nI said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said\nNigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said\nI said yeah, oh no no no no no no\nOh no no no no no no no\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou really got some nerve talkin' bout me like you're better\nCause you got your shit together and I'm really goin' through it\nI don't think you have a clue what it feels like\nDoin' dirt knowin' in your heart you ain't wanna do it\nI don't got one G bone in my body\nI ain't never gang banged, I don't know nothing about it\nI don't claim to be a thug nigga or Illuminati\nBut there really ain't no tellin' what I do when I get rowdy\nAnd I'm starvin' and my back against the wall and you ballin'\nEverytime I see you, all you do is flash hundreds\nEverything on fleek, I ain't never had nothin'\nI just wanna be you, wanna feel like stuntin'\nAnd lettin' loose and they told me don't bend the rules\nThis is my winter blues, you don't know what I finna do\nAnything necessary to make it up in the news\nAnd I'm taking every mothafuckin' thing that I pick and choose\nI'm done with that hating shit, the fuck do you think this is?\nDamn it, you made me sick, ain't no time for no babysit\nThis is the way we live and yes I'm okay with this\nYou think you all that and a bag of potato chips?\nCould jump off a crazy bridge, and enough of you idiot kids\nGo suckin' a lady dick, I would never just make amends\nWith none of you shakin' hands in public like yeah yeah\nLike get the fuck out of my face, dude\n\n[Bridge]\nListen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings\nYou don't have any idea just what a nigga had to do to get loose\nAll I wanted was to make a decent living\nI can't even count on all my fingers how much shit I went through\nWoo, what I went through\nYeah, what I went through\nUh, and when shit get real\nAin't really nothing that you can do, woo\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo, what's up, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you\nPeace\n\n[Brief Message]\nYo, who the fuck do you think you are\nTryna give advice to a child? My child\nNigga, you the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life, my nigga\nYou the last person that should be trying to give advice\nTo anybody about anything, let alone my fucking kid\nActing like some fucking role model or some shit\nNigga, no nobody wanna be like you, stop it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/895cf32a9779b29f3e18b6c7cb55b3e2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
