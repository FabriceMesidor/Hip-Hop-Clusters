OW!\n\n[Hook: Kid Cudi & Charlie Wilson]\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nSuch an easy morning, we on a ride\nAnd I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive\nTurn the radio down if they playing that bullshit\nThey don\u2019t want black people to think and drive\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nHe think he live, he think he cold\nHe think I\u2019m high, I\u2019m in thinker mode\nEyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts\nThe streets are like the high road that I go across\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nI mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets\nThe Phillip Lim remind them that it\u2019s Fashion Week\nAnd the weather wasn\u2019t barely hot\nDid I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?\nDid I mention G.O.O.D. Music and forever we hot?\nMotherfucker, are you ready or not?\n\n[Hook: Kid Cudi]\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\n\n[Bridge: Kanye West]\nThis goes out to the hardcore hip-hop\n(Can\u2019t stop, you can\u2019t stop)\nThis goes out to the all core hip-hop\n(Can\u2019t stop, you can\u2019t stop)\n\n[Verse 4: Pusha T]\nAs Ye flips the piano\nThe mood swings like the change of a channel\nHe\u2019s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel\nSelling kilos through your iPod Nano\nCocaine vandal, I induct scandal\nMoney drive you crazy, look at Marbury\u2019s handle\nVaseline face, reminiscent of my tires\nIce cream paint job, something like Breyer's\nEuro tank top, Dior-inspired\nSell it to you hard, no assembly required\nYuugh! In 2012 in 2010\nWhich makes this a time machine, not just any Benz\nFloss for the members of the gang with the 20 in\nWhile haters wish death upon me, that\u2019s many men\nYeah, and if he slam you on your paper route\nStop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out\n\n[Hook: Kid Cudi & Charlie Wilson]\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\n\n[Verse 5  Big Sean]\nNow tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right\nDon\u2019t worry, we gon' be here all night\nAnd you know a nigga rep that Westside (Westside)\nWestside, Westside\nSo t-t-tell me who the freshest of them all?\nThey claiming that they fresh, they ain\u2019t fresher than my balls\nA nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball\nEmcee hunting season, putting heads up on the wall\nI sneak peeked ahead while we headed to the loft\nMan, I always thought with the head inside my drawers\nI guess that's why in school, my grades went from A's to B's to C's\nAll over double D's, I be absent all week\nThis is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for\nMan, that\u2019s the fam, we let \u2018em in through the side door\nHold on, that\u2019s the girl you gave a wedding ring?\nMan, me and my niggas nutted on her everything\n\n[Interlude: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]\nAnd let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\nAnd let me hear you say ahh, la-la-la\nLa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la\n(As promised!)\n\n[Verse 6: Kanye West]\nNow put your hands up to the sky\nUntil the day in that we die\nAnd we'll be here all evening\nG.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend\n\n[Hook: Kid Cudi]\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\nAre you ready to go?\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready\n\n[Outro: Kid Cudi]\nI know the city getting ready for me\nI know the city getting ready", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52ad0cc13494562a97400330ada39658.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
