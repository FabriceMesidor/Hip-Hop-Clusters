Bitch, I don't mind dying, man\nI just ended up on every bitch's sex list\nGenie in the bottle, get a muthafuckin' deathwish\nThugga in this bitch, he say fuck y'all niggas\nBreaking buds down the size of a football nigga\nRed beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul nigga\nLet Nina bust in your face like a porn star nigga\nYeah I keep a Brian Pumper, no homo\nThe shit I'm on got the world moving in slow-mo\nMan, I told Mack I was gonna do it\nAbove the law, but under the influence\nMan, I was on the skateboard, kick push swagger\nGot my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow\nI had her ass up in the air\nI swear I got the largest clip in the world\nRight here in my gat\nAnd I wish a nigga play\nI'mma bust a nigga ass\nHate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass\n187 and a hockey mask, YMCMB gonna ball\nTil we fall. And this fuck all y'all\nGonna ball til we fall. And this fuck all y'all\nWe straight, sorry for the wait", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a22efe31e108ac84ea44f489ff2716f3.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
