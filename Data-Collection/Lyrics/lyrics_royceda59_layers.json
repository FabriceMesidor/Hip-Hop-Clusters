The real joy of being a human being is to be able to use your mind in the manner that the Almighty God has designed the human mind to do\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nTug of war and my mind's like a clash of the titans\nThoughts contrast so it's layers to my writin'\nGod fearin', but I'm Guy Fisher\nYeah, God hearin', but I'm gone fishin'\nI'm an artist, drug dealer, foreign car keys\nDrop jewels so these falcons like the Maltese\nBirds in the trunk so these keys, now they homin'\nLetters and numbers on the Coupe like it's Roman\nWoo, all black like the omen\nKim said it, yup, BIG wrote it\nSo I'm feeling like a Greek God when I quote it\nLightyears ahead, but I was caught up in the moment\nMoment of clarity, moment of silence\nBurner on my waist, yet I'm saying stop the violence\nSitting on that white horse, look at prince valiant\nDad shakes his head cause the worst waste his talents\nI philosophize for them Pitchfork scholars\nDevil on my shoulder and the pitchfork follows\nPoking at my problems, I know how to solve 'em\nWith a ski mask, automatic or revolver\n\n[Interlude 1]\nA slave is one whose power and authority is ruled over by another and whose sphere of freedom is limited according to the wishes of a master. Your power and authority is ruled over by another and your sphere of freedom of activity is governed by the wishes of somebody else\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nThem niggas wanna see me runnin', they know I won't\nThey say misery loves company, no, I don't\nAin't got no time for you to try on no Manolo Blahniks\nAll I got time to do is go back in time\nAnd pose with the Unabomber\nJust so I can go back in time a second time to photobomb it\nI live by a code of demonic, Illuminati, Obama, Hovanomics\nHold up, hurdles in life, I hop in a Turbo and roll around 'em\nI'm Doug E. Fresh in the flesh, I beat box\nI boo-boo-du-du between the sheets to seek the G-Spot\nI'm in bed with three naked ladies holding hands\nI'm in bed with three major labels\nAnd I ain't talkin' 'bout wearing clothing brands\nUnderground locomotive man\nPutting on a global show that no promoter can\nI philosophize with wise words from learned lessons\nIn my world mistakes turns to blessings\nThe hate turned to destiny\nI'm saying \"Lord Jesus\" while the Lord's most gorgeous creatures take turns blessing me\nI got your baby momma down on all fours\nWhen drama comin', I'm all for it\nIf it ain't about the money please let this be your last question\nYou players can jump if you want\nBut you half-stepping like Paul George\nI make the yay invisible in like a day or two\nThat's how the players do, my nigga, there's layers to it\n\n[Interlude 2]\nFirst in science, first in technology, wealthiest country on Earth, most powerful country on Earth is twenty sixth in education. So you have all been taken and you don't even realize that you have been dumbed to the point where you are like sheep\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nParanoid of poverty, hustle was the philosophy\nI seen a kilo, I swear it became a part of me\nLie, cheat and steal, I had it mastered by my teens\nStarted hands on, a nigga still pulling strings\nHotel suites, straight selling nigga's dreams\nMotel 6 as I let the beeper ring\nWas a water boy, but balling always in my genes\nSeason ticket holder, nigga sitting with the team\nFeds on the roof of the spreads in the juice\nSo suspicious of the cars, tuitions for the schools\nLabeled a mastermind, I positioned every move\nShots fired, now the deposition from the crew\nSmooth operation, but the money came in knots\nForty million there, I dare you tell me what I'm not\nI own fifty homes and wanna get fifty more\nCounting this fast money and fucking my bitches slow\nRozay", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/dd20ac528392f68e4406c4dc944de369.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
