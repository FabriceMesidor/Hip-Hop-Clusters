Who to love?\nI been layin' on the rough\nTryin' drugs for a month\nHopin' it'd keep me up\n\n[Verse 1]\nNo, this is not a bluff\nToo late to make me change\nI been feelin' like a castaway (Yeah)\nSittin' waitin' on your page\nThat you 'bout to pull up to the cave\nThen we practice fifty shades of gray\nBeatin', punchin' on the grain\nBloody knuckles, I been sippin' muddy\nI'm so numb now 'til the run-around\nAre you sendin' me? Are you comin' now?\n'Cause I know, soon, I'll be comin' down\nI'll be comin' down, I'll be comin' down\nDarker, darker in the back of the night\nI been rollin', rollin', I been feelin' so nice\nI been got it, got it, got it, feelin' so right\nWindin', windin', why'd you wind it so tight?\nI been runnin' from my face, so precise\nI didn't get it, got me happed in my ride\nI just run up on and smashin' the side\nThey're the counts, I been all in my city\nMy state of mind, I been feelin' so gritty\nAnd I, man, I, no-no-no, my nigga\nI know-know, my nigga, I know-know, my nigga\nYou know?\n\n[Chorus]\nWho to blame? Who to trust? Who to love?\nI been layin' on the rough\nTryin' drugs for a month\nHopin' it'd get me up\n\n[Bridge]\nHopin' it'd make a change\nTrade the bus for a Range\nDo that shit any day, they trade the game for they chain\nI been feelin', feel ashamed, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nWho to blame? Who to trust? Who to love?\nI been layin' on the rough\nTryin' drugs for a month, yeah\nHopin' that'd keep me up, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nNever bein' up, yeah\nI been rollin' in a cup, yeah\nRollin', rollin', in enough, yeah\nRollin', don't you call my bluff, yeah\nShooter shootin' at me, uh, yeah\nShooters, shooters stick you up, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
