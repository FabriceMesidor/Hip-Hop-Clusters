Who the best? They holla me\nNombre, Ho-lay shit, I don't spit crack, I spit cocaine crisp\nI ain't fuckin' with it if it's no payment\n'Cause everyone knows paid dues don't pay rent\nI'm dope like the coke that I'm laced with\nDreams what I'm chasin', flow hot it's chafin'\nThis is why I'm hot? No, that is why I'm blazin'\nDilla jacked Nick, I am shinin' like the diamond that I'm draped in\nBut I don't wear jewelery, it's HUF over Louis V\nExcuse the endurance miss, this critic thing is new to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/26aab12b83ba9717e49e2205dd583b44.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
