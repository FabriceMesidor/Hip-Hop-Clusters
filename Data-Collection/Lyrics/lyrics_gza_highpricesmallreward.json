Stupid!\n\n[Verse 2: Masta Killa]\nWithout a doubt, it's in the heart\nWhere the best darts were written\nSitting at the window of the Grand Old Earths\nYouths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat\nCause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach\nBroken homes breed seeds of no guidance\nLeft to wander the streets and experiment with devilishment\nViolent, felon offenders, supreme folders\nOne-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode\nThe battlefield haunting, the daunting\nWu-Tang dance, deadly emits six pence\nSpiral, rifle barrel pointed, elastic noose\nPlastic head wrap stifle, survival\nTribal, title - Secret Rival\nArticle subliminal message throwing\nBitch niggas hoeing on labels\nMic cables, capable of slowing down jets on deck\nFucking you straight through continuously\nJustice, the war of the critical penital\nSome long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat\nDrama builds, it's the street prophecies fulfilled\nBitter chill currents to the invited\nBang for the phones, live niggas on their way home\nSnatch poems from clones, we got it sewn", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bdda24520e7142d4154c6549b6d2d517.820x820x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
