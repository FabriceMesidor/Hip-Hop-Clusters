Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes\nIn this day and age, in this period of time\nTryin' to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr\nTryin' to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Fat and Bizarre\n[\u2026] That's why you beg to differ me\nYou ain't got no style, plus you lack delivery\nNot to brag, I don't mean to boast\nLook, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost\n[\u2026]\nYou're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone\nIf I put banana peels around this fuckin' microphone\nGo get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top\nAnd tear this building down\n\u2018Cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
