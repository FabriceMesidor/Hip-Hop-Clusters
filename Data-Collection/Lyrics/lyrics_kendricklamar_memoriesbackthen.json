I know\nWhen the lights go out and I'm in my bed\nI think of all the madness in my head oh\nAll of the things that I did back then\nOh when I'm in my bed\nI think of all the memories I've had oh\nAll of the things that I did back then", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
