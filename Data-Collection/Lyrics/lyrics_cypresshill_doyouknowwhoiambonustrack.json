(3x)\n\n[B-Real]\nI'm in a deep yo\nPeep though\nThings are on the fallout\nKids all lookin' to peel my wig back\nI figure that shit out\nThe other day\nThe rearview mirror\nWhen things are closer than they appear\nTear shit down hit the corner\nCut through the alley\nSeen a fine chick\nDidn't have time to rally\nI remember you but I gotta dip\nSkip the fuck out\nThese niggas are following me from behind haters\nThey can't fade us or eliminate us to get famous\nIt's all painless\nI'll show 'em what insane in the brain is\nMaybe they'll run, or find out what the rain is\nThey want beef fuck giving it to 'em shameless\n\n[Hook]\nDo you know who I am?\nDo you know my lifestyle I don't think so....\nDo you know who I am?\nDo you know my lifestyle maybe you don't...\nDo you know who I am?\nDo you know my lifestyle I don't think so....\nDo you know who I am?\nDo you know my lifestyle I don't think so....\n\n[B-Real]\nThey can't deal with the ruckus\nMotherfuckers get wicked in situations\nThat causes a nigga to react\nMore to the back hit the corner\nKnow what they say\nCaught a nigga live on to fight another day\nMaybe fight and not appear\nMaybe they want it\nMaybe you niggas following my attention\nI dispatch the troops quick didn't give 'em time\nDidn't give 'em a second to push me over the line\nBetween that the humiliation I saw my life flash\nGun blast, all out confusion\nThe smoke clears\nFoes crawlin' outta here\nSnap fingers like magic, they disappear\nThese bitches had it no question they're all bloody\nNever fuck with nobody who's crazy!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[B-Real]\nI'm in this world hell called life\nWillin' to risk it\nPop the disc and you ain't bustin' a biscuit\nFools think they heavy weight\nThey never wait\nLike a nigga tryin' to get pussy on the first date\nThey featherweight, whatever hate if you want to\nKill me in my soul will come back to haunt you\nYou never sleep, never get rest\nFeelin' the cold breath, you're the opposite of everlast\nYou never last!\nPass 7 days of madness\nAfter my soul path\nYour spiritual plane is weak, nigga you need to fast\nCause you're bitin' my shit\nMouths full but don't swallow\nMy shit's acid burning your stomach making you hollow\nBest learn who you're fucking with\nBefore you try shit\nYou might die with my name caught in your eyelids\nSee that, weave that, inhale the weed sack\nI be that nigga willin' to die for what I'm feelin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a8c7f66f1e008c7b9c607a9c9ae757c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
