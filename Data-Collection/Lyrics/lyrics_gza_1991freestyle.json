You begin to cease to control it\nYou fumbled, couldn't rumble, so then I stole it\nHow did you think you could make first down?\nIf you were boxing, you wouldn't escape the first round\nSave the bull, don't even begin to waste time, drop the mic\nBefore you reach fate, then you rhyme and realize\nYou were just weak from the start\nYou make demos, but really don't master the art\nI know ya know deep down inside you can't flow\nPlus, you're backwards, when I said red, you said \"Go!\"\nBut you should've stopped, because the red was the bloodshed\nBut you ignored the warning and you went ahead\nYou tried me, G, by setting up a match\nA fair one, meaning no strings attached, then bang!", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a739985b56e643a97770d00818e03963.635x384x1.png"}], "artist": "GZA"}
