D.R.E\n\n[Verse 1: Prophet]\nIt ain't too much I haven't seen\nTouched or been through\nAlways on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you\nBut I got million dollar deals to attend to\nTime is money and I don't have a second to lend you\nI am the one with the empire to run\nWest Coast messiah, best known for fire\nThrow up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired\nNo more lowriders and golden spokes on tires?\nSSTOOOP! I just had to detox\nNow I'm back on the block like classic Reeboks\nAs the beat knocks you can put it in the air\nCouple of my artists beefing but I wouldn't interfere\nMy style is innovation, trials and tribulations\nYou can't rush perfection so thanks for your patience\nGot on my troops, assembled in groups ready to shoot\nDressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that...\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like that, these cats are sick without me\nWhen you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?\nNever seen all you looking so lonely\nBut the Doc's office is open, prescribing you what you need\nGot my patients out there waiting, the line is out the door\nIt's a dose of what you folks have been out there looking for...\n\n[Verse 2: Prophet]\nIt ain't another nigga that can play how I play\nWho else can take a longer hiatus, get shot dead\nCome back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay\nYou on the road to success but you're going the wrong way\nWhat up Mo, I'm California's own, homegrown\nLight up and zone and smoke out till your brains blown\nMe and Nate Dogg, on the same song\nNow that's something you can definitely bank on\nTell me have you seen a, producer that's meaner\nOn beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina\nI had my fair share of courtroom subpoenas\nNow, trying to live my life a little bit cleaner\nChange is what I had to do\nI used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude\nMade a lot of dough, then got senses to life on death row\nI won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that...\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Prophet]\nCompton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya\nSo please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya\nY'all heard it first here, I've birthed the careers\nOf almost every hot rapper in the past 20 years\nYou would think dudes happily would name a school after me\nBut instead they see me at events and start attacking me\nBut my faculty is standing right in back of me\nYou must like sipping food through a straw like a daiquiri\nCome on, man... who you pretending to touch?\nWhen the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much\nBuck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch\nWe ain't tough nahhh... we just defending what's us\nI got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels\nThat's why I spot the fool, trying to stop my moves\nI'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses\nThat can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is\nIt's like that...\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
