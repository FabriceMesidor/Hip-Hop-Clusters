Please pay for me\"\nI make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding\nThen you can come inside like a hurricane warning\nI got a lot of sluts, I like to call Hopsin luck\nBut now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough\nI needed something new for moments when I gotta bust\nSo lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves\nI got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny?\nI'll stab you in the brain with a knife, you can keep that in mind\nYou talking shit inside your house? Cool, fine, fuck it\nI'll break in and stomp you out inside of it\nYeah, Hopsin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1620b55458e423f96bf6316d13418223.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
