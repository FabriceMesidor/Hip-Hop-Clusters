them studs thinking they can get close\nI know I got you tripping off the shit\nA nigga said off a overdose\n\n[Hook: Twista]\nI done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it\nMe overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing\nKill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees\nAnd snatching fees, now that I'm up in this game\nI done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it\nMe overdosing on weed and sending all y'all off into a thing\nKill off all enemies while making G's catch you off on your knees\nNiggas rolling me B's just so they can hang\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nC'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties\nThat's full of bitches where they let me rub titties\nBe able to pack a snub with me in case we get in some static\nAnd gotta start leaking blood from stud skinnies\nSo don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason\nI smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw\nIt can't be nickel or soft the way it's choking me\nPotency'll have me rocking mics\nAnd giving your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hooking the law\nYou're looking in awe, took what you saw\nGot the B's, pen and pad out the bottom drawer\nThen got to biting and formulating some shit you called your own\nBut take it to the rehab 'cause you got a flaw\nTo put it simple you ain't cold enough\nTripping out like you can't control the stuff\nLacking rhythm like you known to bust\nIn a different zone from us\nYou niggas need to sit the fuck down\nGet a swisher and roll this up\nIf you think I'm speaking too bold, what's up\nI ain't even on no ho shit, plus the mob is so thick\nI'm the type of nigga you shouldn't want to get up close to\nAnd take a smoke with\nIf there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick\nI be tweaking with speaking, releasing energy to show I know the ropes\n'Cause when it comes to this rap shit\nNiggas will choke 'til I'm ghost\nWhile I breath reefer smoke from my overdose\nTry to put me to the test, give me some Buddha bless\nI'll show you who the best\nRelease the vocal trilogy\n\nAlright, T, god damn slow it up, man\nMotherfuckers' done felt you, man, we can go to the next shit\nGod damn, man, you stopping motherfuckers and shit\nMan, I'm trying to get my zone on\nLet niggas hear what the fuck I'm doing man\nI mean, you done zoned man, let's go to the next cut baby\nMan, fuck that shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d3d24875934a3f4e43760767e5f7584d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
