Shit, I was into sneakers\nAnd fitted caps, side kicks\nMy same bitch, she a down bitch\nHad a little daughter, glad it ain't a boy\nKnew she'd bring me joy, so I named her Joy\nKiss her on her head, then I kiss her lips\nThen I kiss her cheek, lay her down to sleep\nTrials and tribulations helped me through my situations\nLittle observations stopped the cops from confrontations\nAnd the ghetto bird, and a nigga snitched\nBut I'm still dipping, shit, I ain't tripping\n\n[Hook: ScHoolboy Q over an incomprehensible sample]\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\n(BJ the Chicago Kid)\n(I know I'm not perfect\nBut I'll still make a decision that make my life still worth it, yea-ea-eahhh\nAnd sometimes it may hurt\nBut I know what you see ain't what it's gon' be, cause I know my worth, yeeeaaahhhh...)\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nGot a lil' older, nigga seen a lot of shit\nBeen out in Boston, even got to see the Knicks\nI've been to Dallas, slap a five with the bench\nBack to the hood where niggas betting on the six\nBut shit is crazy\nLil' Teisha and Tamika bout to kill they babies\nPregnant at the same time, and they think that shit is cute\nAlways running from the truth, bigger dream they must pursue\nAnd they babies wasn't in it\nJust going bout they business in the club\nShe off of Guinness, adioses with the lemon\nV.I.P. she dreams of, in the club looking for mean buzz\nIn a dress looking distinctive\nAss hanging, got that ass hanging with the biggest baller in the club\nAin't got a dub, but she want some love\nWasn't polite, but she feel it's right (feel it's right)\nLay it down, then he dimmed the lights, played it right for the night\n\n[Hook: ScHoolboy Q over an incomprehensible sample]\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\n(BJ the Chicago Kid)\n(I know I'm not perfect\nBut I'll still make a decision that make my life still worth it, yea-ea-eahhh\nAnd sometimes it may hurt\nBut I know what you see ain't what it's gon' be, cause I know my worth, yeeeaaahhhh...)\n\n\n[Verse 3: Punch]\nUh, ignorance is bliss, but to know is pain\nNo matter what we reap, we still sow the same\nThe concept of change is second-rate to change\nEither way around, the cycle still remains\nOut my project window, observing the wannabes blowing endo\nShooting dice on the corner, big homie roll up with his kinfolk\nUnfold a stack on 'em like, what they hitting for?\nSlamming the doors on his Benzo\nHe left the engine running, bumping something sounding like\nLate eighties R&B, trunk full of China white\nType of nigga ladies like, known dope dealer\nMoney, cash, hoes getter, slash stone cold killer\nHe can't sleep at night, his victim's eyes piercing through his soul\nHe wake up every time his eyes close\nThat's who them young boys aspire to see\nUnderneath the palm trees, that's who they dying to be\nBut I'm good\n\n[Hook: ScHoolboy Q over an incomprehensible sample]\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...\n(BJ the Chicago Kid)\n(I know I'm not perfect\nBut I'll still make a decision that make my life still worth it, yea-ea-eahhh\nAnd sometimes it may hurt\nBut I know what you see ain't what it's gon' be, cause I know my worth, yeeeaaahhhh...)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e5d39814aadb84f19c68cb7ca188a5d.950x946x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ScHoolboy Q"}
