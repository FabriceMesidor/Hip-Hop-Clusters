'bout you, shawty anybody get it\nSo 'fore you get robbed, get trapped by 80\nJust know Hustle Gang thug a hella lot\n\n[Chorus: T.I]\nAll we really know a kid pimpin', all we do is get fly\nVVS shine like the sun outside\nSomebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money\nTell that nigga \"You a mothafuckin' lie\"\nNigga hell you sayin'?
