Raggedy-ass precinct\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt was money on the table with the bricks\nI was in the livin' room fillin' on this bitch\nHeard my car alarm going off on my 6\nSo my dogs start barkin' and some niggas hit the fence\nSo I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window\nPulled the blinds down and took one hit of the Indo'\nThem niggas ain't doing shit, but stealin' my neighbors rims so\nWalked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over\nThat's what I'm rollin' with...\nNah, I ain't seen shit and I ain't snitchin' on nobody\nYeah, that's my four-five, but it ain't got no bodies\nThem two dead niggas? Them is nobody\nThey should have torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies\nI mean look at these pictures, shit is so sloppy\nCouldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti\nFeed a nigga to the sharks after dark\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, fuck this shit, I thought I told y'all\nIt was money on the table by the bricks\nI was at the kitchen table choppin' up some shit\nListenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little (*bullet sound*)\nSo I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'\nOh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fit\nSo I turn down all the lights and cocked my four-fifth\nSeen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it\nHow much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka?\nLet me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke\nBut shit, y'all got a nigga stressed\nI gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?\nShit, y'all bitches better get some rest\n'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami\n'Fore I snitch on myself or the 'hood, you understand me?\nYeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy\nNiggas runnin' 'round the 'hood singin' they should get a Grammy\nAnd you two motherfuckas should get an Oscar\nWith this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process\n'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs\nI watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years\nNo evidence, no bid, I don't know who split them niggas' wigs\n\n[Verse: 3]\nAlready told y'all, it was money on the table with the bricks\nI was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit\nThen I heard my dogs barkin', and some noise by the fence\nSo I ran to my room and reached for the four-fifth\nThen I seen three niggas by my back door\nLooked out the bathroom window and seen two more\nSo I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer\nGuess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
