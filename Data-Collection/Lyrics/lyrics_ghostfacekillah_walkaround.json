I don't know, I just don't feel right\nHavin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean?\nNah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son\nYou know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean?\nMy face feels numb, son\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nFlashbacks to me blowin' his brains out\nAll I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out\nOxy cleans weak 'round the chest area\nRighthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat\nAnd my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee\nBut I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach\nOn the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York\n'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk\nManhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib\nBattering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids\nNow my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz\nShe paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks cause of these pigs\nPlus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me\nI told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me\nI'll never eat up out a garbage can\nI'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan\n\n[Outro 1 {*outro 2 plays along with outro 1*}]\nI ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight\nBut I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off\nCops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert\nThey gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean? I don't give a fuck\nDon't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?\nIf I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it\nYo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype\nNiggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin'\nY'all niggas'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you\nMotherfuckers, fuck ya'll niggas, I ain't goin' crazy\nSleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck ya'll niggas, man\n\n[Outro 2]\nI walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze\nPeople talking to me and calling my name\nBut I don't hear a word they say\nI walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze\nPeople talking to me and calling my name\nBut I don't hear a word they say\nI know my Mother's worried about me\nCause they might have to put me away at any time\nCause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me\nShe oh! I believe she took my mind...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1bbc70540da138c70debc041f381d0f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
