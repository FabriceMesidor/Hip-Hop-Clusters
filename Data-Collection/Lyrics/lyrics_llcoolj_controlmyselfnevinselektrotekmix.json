got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nI could feel my body yearning\nThe room just started turning\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nI need everybody to report to the dance floor right now\nNo me puedo controlar\nAqui con el Se\u00f1or LL Cool J\nY aqui estoy... ya tu sabes\nUno, dos, tres, muevete!\nY'all know what this is...So...So...Def!\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nThe strobelights are flashing\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nThe club was far from empty (Uh)\nIt was crowded at the entry (Woo!)\nI slide right through like how I do\nThis girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)\nShe said her name Shayeeda\nI could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)\nWhen they tight and thick them jeans don't fit\nI'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)\nI could feel my body yearning (Uh)\nThe room just started turning\nDidn't want to go out on the floor\nBut this girl was so determined (Uh-huh!)\nMy brain began to sizzle (Come on)\nI'm sweatin' just a little\nOn the dance floor in the middle\nShe turned around and giggled\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself (Aww!)\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself (Haha)\nIt's hard to control myself (Come on)\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Me too)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]\nTemptation is a mother (Uh-huh)\nHow we lust for one another (Yeah)\nWe barely know each other\nYet we're wilding like we're lovers (Uh-huh)\nThe air is full of passion (Haha)\nThe strobe lights are flashin' (Yeah)\nThe hustlers throw cashin'\nThe bartender keeps splashin' (Uh)\nHer moves were so erotic (Come on)\nHer gaze was so hypnotic (Come on)\nI begged this girl to stop it (Ha)\nBut she continued to pop it (Woo!)\nYou know I know you like it\nLet me hit you on your Sidekick (Yeah)\nBecause the after party is at my body\nMeet me, you're invited\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself (Haha)\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Say what?)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J & Jermaine Dupri]\nShe licked, off, her lip, gloss (Oh)\nHer hips, tossed, back, and forth (Uh-huh)\nSide, to side, and up, and down (Hey, haha)\nShe touched, the ground, it turned, me out\nI'm battling desire (Uh-huh)\nLord help me douse this fire (Uh-huh)\nThis internal inferno\nHotter than a shot of Cuervo (Come on)\nHer top was short and purple\nBelly dancing in a circle\nWhen I feel like this I can't resist\nStop it, don't make me hurt you\nShe said\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make me leave my man\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nYou got, you got, you got\nWhat it takes to make this boy be bad\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard to control myself\nIt's hard for me to control myself (Say what)\nAnd to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya (Uh-huh)\nLike I wanna, like I wanna, wanna\n\n[Bridge: LL Cool J w/ Jennifer Lopez]\nZihZih
