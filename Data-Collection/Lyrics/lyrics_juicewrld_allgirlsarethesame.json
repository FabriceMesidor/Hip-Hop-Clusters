Am I livin'?\nIt's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I am insane, demons in my brain, love\nPeace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love\nNow I am insane, demons in my brain, love\nPeace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/21b0f0606d3fb424561f332e1425e1ff.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
