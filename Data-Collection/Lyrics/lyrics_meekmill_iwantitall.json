Thank god I live my life\nI'm in a GranTurismo 2 tone\nPassenger's a red bone\nWhoo! She's like the car cause she can't never keep her top on\nSee here, I was sleeping in class missing the lessons\nI was millionaire dreamin'. Fuck passing these tests\nMy teachers used to say I was lazy and second-guessing\nNow I'm laughing at they ass, blowing cash, and countin' blessings\nI understood the SATs, yeah, OK, but\nWhat about these million dollars these luxury Benz cuts\nThem Escalades on 26's them tires they thin cut\nYou mean to tell me you'd pass up steak and lobster for school lunch\nI made my first mill told moms I was leaving home\nThen I made 30 more god damn I was puttin' on\nI used to dollar menu and spectate at the mall\nBut now I'm buying that bitch out, cuz shit I want it all\n\n(Hook)\nCause I want it all\nI want it all\nYeah I deserve the world cause I hustle hard\nYeah I want it all\nI want it all\nYou know I'm on my grind cause I hustle hard\nI'm in it for the money and the cars, the clothes and the hoes\nThe diamonds on my neck and wrist froze\nCause I want it all\nCause I want it all\nHey\n\n(Verse 2: Meek Mill)\nFirst off where the money at\nCause I go crazy 'bout that paper I'm a money-ac\nMy hood prefer to walk but I be runnin' that\nSo far gone you would think I wasn't coming back\nSouth D and George Kush, we ain't smoking none of that\nYou be puffin on that Reggie Bush (cough cough) running back\nYou just bought a used car, you think you gon' stunt in that\nI just bought a Audemar and my shit it cost double that\nCrushing that\nStuntin' is my favorite sport\nEatin' without no playing fork\nOn the road to riches and I ain't got no plan on taking shorts\nSome people will call it greedy I just call it making sure\nIf I ain't got no food up on my plate then I'll be taking yours\nI know what I want, I know what I'm doing\nThey telling me different, I know where I'm going\nFuck talkin' about it, I'll show 'em I'm doing\nProgress in the night and ???\n\n(Hook)\n\n(Verse 3: Meek Mill & Lou Williams)\n(Meek Mill)\nMind on my money\nMoney in my pocket\nThousand Benny Franks\nMan you know nothin' 'bout it\nThat's money in the bank\nHe selling in my closet, winning no matter what\nLosing ain't a option\nI said, they ain't see my vision though\nAll I had to do was break it down like the vision though\nThey wanted that fake shit, I was on original\nThey ain't gonna get it for me I'mma go and get it oh\n(Lou Williams)\nOK a mill ain't shit\nAnd a problem ain't either\nKeep a couple of both long as I'm filling up arenas\nPhilly it's ice cold so punch yo heat keep the heater\nBig dawg on his hip, like an old school beeper\nI'm barely even legal but I'm 4 cars deep\nThree houses to my name my people stealing these streets\nThe hell with VIP, y'all ain't gotta hide me\nI'm on the dance floor shit, Meek he know where I be\n\n(Hook)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6929169de7116d41676151bdea5cc773.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
