Smoking something\nPlaying my newest shit, and you know its bumpin\nYou ain't used to it, you gon grow accustomed\nNiggas hate me cause they got no progression\nAll the realest niggas, they know and trust em\nAnd plus, your money's slow as fuck\nI bet soon as I roll one up\nThat they gon know it's us\nBefore I pass it, hit it twice and I hold it\nTrying to get my money to the point where I can't fold it\n\n[Hook]\nGoing away...\n\n[Verse 2]\nI made it happen, I made it happen\nAnd niggas got mad at me cause I did this shit off of rapping\nHear what they saying\nThey need no luck because I macked it\nAnd now I got my own gang, nigga\nI'm the captain\nYou know me player, ballin nigga and stackin\nAll the same with a passion\nAll cause I'm bringing racks in\nRemember when all those niggas was passed em?\nBut now they still call me the main attraction\nSome niggas want the power, I want respect\nSome niggas want the fame, I want the check\nI'm in Dubai wake up I'm in Tibet\nThem niggas had it, man, it's nothing short of savage..\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interview: Wiz Khalifa & Rob Markman]\nWe gettin' ratchet right? Let's get ratchet\n\nHow do you resolve that?\n\nThere is no resolution.
