Dee got the strap and she anxious\nHurry up 'fore she spank shit\nComin' round the corner spittin' rounds\nThey can't hold me down\nCaught them sucker-ass bitches outta bounds\nNow tell me how that sound?\nA double date laced with hate\nMake 'em pray for the judgement day\nNow tell me how that sound?\nA double date laced with hate\nMake 'em pray for the judgment day\u2014stinkin' beyotch!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI bet you that I got somethin' you ain't got\nThat's called courage\nIt don't come from no liquor bottle\nIt ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon\nI don't walk around like no G\n\u2018Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person\nI don't try to act like you do\n\u2018Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't\n\n[Refrain: 2Pac]\nEverywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier\nEverywhere I see, a soldier like me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aff64f752ccfff1d48590e5db3c0357a.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
