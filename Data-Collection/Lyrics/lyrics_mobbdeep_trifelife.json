livin' the motherfuckin' trife life\nStill have another day, right?\nIt's only right\nLet me put you on to what happened, son\nYou ain't gonna believe this shit\nKick that shit\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nIt's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty\nThat's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty\nShe asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever\nShe got a crew too and said that we should get together\nI said, \"Aight, just call me back in a hour\nSo I can take a shower and gather up the manpower\"\nThen I hung up the horn\nAnd I thought to myself that it might be on\nCause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)\nEver since I left the ho lonely in tears\nAin't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears\nIdeas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear\n(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions\nPlus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin\nShe might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners\nWaiting for us to get up off the train and surround us\nOr maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion\nBut this shit do happen to niggas very often\nSo fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to\nMy crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental\nWe put together five soldiers\nThe bitch called, my blood curdled\nTold me to meet her on Myrtle\nGot to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train\nWe put a plan together, just in case the beef came\nNow we Bed-Stuy bound\nFar from home and on unknown ground\nBut together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet\nFirst nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet\nIt took eternity, we reached our destination\nMy heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient\nWe finally got to Myrtle outside the train station\nI saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient\nBut hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up\nMy legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound\nTold my man, \"Eyes open 'cause it might go down\"\nSaid he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound\nEvery angle of the car was smoked out and tinted\nSo we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it\nIt might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we\nJetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me\nWord Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo\n\n[Hook]\nCheck it out, check it out, check it out, yo\nTrife life got me thinking like an animal\nNo doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo\nWhat can kill you is what you don't know\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nOK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib\nBut the bitch live in the Bridge\nYou ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know\nThe niggas in the Bridge be setting it\nYou thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat\nOn the 41st Side of 12th Street\nThe side where niggas don't give a fuck\nThe side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked\nOn your way, to apartment 3A\nWith a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days\nSon get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him\n(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)\nAight bet, so just hold it down\nWhile I cock back the long three pound\nYou're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming\nJust the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening\nYou're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye\nThought you was safe and got caught by surprised\n\"What's goin on?\", as I reply\n\"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide\"\nHe tried to play tough so I put one in his brain\nEven though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain\nCome through truck without heat, how you figure?\nWhen you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger\nBut fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken\nPut you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking\nNow we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn\nGetting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up\nGot the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up\nGet your motherfucking shit swoll up\nNow it's back to Queens to serve fiends\nMaking Cheese  by any means, my eyes on my enemies\nSipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit\nOne-time searching me but never ever find shit\nIt's the everyday, get the loot then breeze\nThough my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's\nBut all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave\nFuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease\nDon't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure\nI get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas\nPulling the trigger when the drama appears\n'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear\nSo yo....\n\n[Hook]\nCheck it out, check it out, check it out, yo\nTrife life got me thinking like an animal\nNo doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo\nWhat can kill you is what you don't know",
