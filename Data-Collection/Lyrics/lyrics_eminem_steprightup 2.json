I got a blunt and some Jesus juice\nWho needs an excuse these days\nThe way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face\nI can do anything and apologize for it later as long\nAs it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave\nIf I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day\nOn a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife\nFor the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice\nTwice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager\nBlaow-blaow, Shade uh 45, shorty, let me get your number, baby\nMaybe I can hump your leg or something?\nBut it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle\nIt's like this, because of that boob, right?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
