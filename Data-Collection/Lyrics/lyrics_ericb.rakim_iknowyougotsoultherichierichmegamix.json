Then you gotta have soul\n'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore\nTake the mic, make the people respond for\nThe R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be\nIf you wanna get on after me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/544b6274041065fc3d40982c5f03d4c6.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
