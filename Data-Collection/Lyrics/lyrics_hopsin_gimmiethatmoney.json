(oh my God)\nYou finally made it, I\u2019m so proud of you\u201d\nSo the next day she called me and asked to kick it\nFor the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it\nCome to find out she was never that terrific\nEspecially a week later when she asked me this shit\n\u201cHey um, Marcus, I really really hate to be a bother\nBut my rent is due, and I\u2019m like broke as fuck\nSo can you please lend me ten hundred dollars, please\u201d\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nMmm-hmm\nSee my ex girl think she slick\nMan let me tell ya how she tried to do me\nShe said she didn\u2019t have a vehicle to drive to work in\nSo she came and asked me for 2 Gs\nAnd although I wasn\u2019t that concerned\nShe said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return\nSo I committed and did it, thinkin\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t forget it\nBut she forgot it, now my stomach got a nasty burn\nI called her! And said, \u201cBitch! Where my money?! You got that?!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cNot yet, see my mom\u2019s mad\nShe said she isn\u2019t gonna pay, you can drop dead\n'Cause I got into a fight with her, she\u2019s a hot head\u201d\nI\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s between you two, not me!\nWhat the hell does that have to do with my cheese!\u201d\nShe said, \u201cOk, ok, stop please\nI swear I\u2019ll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks\u201d\nHuh, five weeks huh?\nIt\u2019s been three months and I ain\u2019t even heard from her\nChanged her damn number, shit\nBitch played me like a dumb motherfucker\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't even make friends\n'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money\nThey like, \"Let me have this, let me have that\nLet me have this\" and they keep on coming, man\n\"Let me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\nLet me get a dollar, give me that money\"\n\n[Outro]\nGive me that dough, Give me that money\nGive me that cheese, Give me that money\nGive me that yea yea yea, Give me that money\nYea yea, Give me that money\nSay yea yea yea yea\nBaby give me that yea yea yea yea\nGive me that yea yea yea yea!
