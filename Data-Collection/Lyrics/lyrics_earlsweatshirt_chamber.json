Of course my old level was gory grow grubbin. Don\u2019t tell me they don\u2019t hunt us for sport\nI chose substances\nNo cuddles, the bases is all covered. Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin. Choke up on the slugger for home run hitters\nNigga it\u2019s on. Chest up his head tucked on the floor. We pressed up on the boy. No more bluff-in\nCold summers, don\u2019t tussle with strangers\nSome of those keep one in the chamber\nThree spliffs had my wing tips clipped\nI was stuck in a hanger. Nigga\nMuffle my pen and muzzle my brain up\nReally I\u2019m just making sure my promise is kept\nChump confused if he know it\u2019s the end\nKept the truth and I\u2019m pounding my chest\nSee it through, keep a noose hangin off of my neck\nYou got the juice? Niggas corny as shit\nWe on the loose, niggas know what it is\nWe makin moves. You niggas corny as shit\nWe got the juice", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abe116b40a921476ff1094726c8d1a8.608x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
