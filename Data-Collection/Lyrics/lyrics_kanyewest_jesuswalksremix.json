(what?)\nYour worst dream is that you was gonna hear that\nIcon to rap is like John the Baptist\nPrepared the way for what I came to say today\nThey deceived us, having thinking Jesus\nReally didn't need us, when He loved the old days\nHe loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway\nEven those who re up for dope, every four days\nTo the strippers in broad day up in Norway\nTo the Detroit player gators in Marbres\nWith me, it's not just bars of music\nI walk with God, I got the scars to prove it\n\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus walks)\nGod show me the way, now the devil can't break me down\n(Jesus walks with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n\n[Outro: Mase]\nEverybody out there\nJust lift your hands right now\nJust say this with me\nFather, I thank you\nFor forgiving me of everything I've ever done\nFor Jesus walking with me\nFor dying for me\nRaising for me\nAnd all my sins have been forgiven\nI'm a changed man\nI'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich\nAnd it's all because of Him\nNow walk with me\nWalk with me, walk, walk, walk with me\nWalk with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e00085bf087c8e35e4d55ae683cbbcd7.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
