Does\u2005he\u2005matter?\nIs he in\u2005your life? Do you love your\u2005wife?\nThese are all questions to ask yourself\n\nDo you wear a white or a black belt?\nDo you care if you kid orders a chicken melt?\nThese are all questions to ask yourself\n\nOHHHHHHHHH\n\nI woke up and I said - Jesus I love you\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re black and I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re blue\nI went to my coworker and he said I can smell you\nDo you shower? Do you wear cologne?\n\nDo you even care if your penis is showing?\nThese are all questions to ask yourself\n\nThis morning I drank coffee. Spilt coffee\nDon\u2019t cry over spilled milk don\u2019t cry woman\nI looked up and Jesus said don\u2019t cry woman don\u2019t cry woman\n\nOOOOHHHHH\n\nBlack lives matter if you open your eyes\nIs my death about my wife or my life?\nYou wanna know the size of my penis? What\u2019s the size of your knowledge\n\nJust fell off my scooter. You asked me if my knees hurt. I looked up at your eyes and you smelled of reefer. I took you in and showed you Jesus. It\u2019s not I love Jesus. It\u2019s we love Jesus\n\nYou tell me you\u2019re not racist. Why haven\u2019t you seen crazy rich Asians?\n\nYou gave life of pi a 6/10 - would you like it more if there was a white guy named Ben?\n\nCheck your socks for congruence - don\u2019t you know brain matter is fluid? You can still go back to school Darnell you can still go back to school Darnell\n\nYou hit me up on FaceTime - asking for hoes on FaceTime why don\u2019t you man up and face time? Or give your mother some face to face time. MAN\n\nYour whack rap and your ad libs are making your mind weak\n\n\nMy wife is a pterodactyl\nShe spin my dick like axel\nNo whites v blacks this ain\u2019t no battle\nAll you youngings get a ride to church like cattle\nI\u2019m the saddle and you the horse\nI don\u2019t fuck with whores\nI do my chores\nAnd of course\nI\u2019m on course\nI got force\nI drink coors\nI write cords\nYou look in the mirror but you don\u2019t see her\nIt ain\u2019t clear\nYou don\u2019t have vision\nYour superstitions\nLike my circumcision\nEat the foreskin bitch\nDon\u2019t tell on your mommy bro don\u2019t be snitch\nIf she is witch you can\u2019t wife\nYou don\u2019t wanna see her boobs you wanna see her mind\nAnd I don\u2019t mind to see a movie with some whites\nBut I don\u2019t like it when the whites see me and start some fights\nIt\u2019s not alright it\u2019s not okay\nI don\u2019t care if straight or gay\nYou know what I\u2019m trying to say\nI\u2019m on my way man\nReese\u2019s pieces Jesus piece Rest In Peace\nYou hold your soul man just go and pee\nI watch you hittas like cinemasins\nI eat raw chicken like it\u2019s cinnamon sticks\nYou bish\nMy penis is real if you wanna see it brother\nI wake up in the morning I call my mother\nWhen is the last time you called your mom\nYou banging girls like rom com\nMy pubes like Pom Pom\nAnd my dick is circumcised\nI\u2019m young sir cum wise\nI\u2019m J.Cole and I got old flows my flow is but into a bowl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db1a9643a028d62543e44c90da3a6ad.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
