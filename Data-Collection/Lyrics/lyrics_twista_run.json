Put yo hands on the car\nYou must be one of them tight big niggas that's old\nBut I'm from the bigger number with the rhythm and roll\nI hit blocks, dip cops\nKept the knot, dropped the Glock, ended up on Wilcox\nIt don't even matter now cause I done throwed them rocks\nWent through a house that I don't know like I was Goldie Locks\nI broke a sweat\nNow I'm smokin' dro in a Lac\nI'm throwin' a pack\nShit, I ain't never goin' back\nIf I happen to go to jail, niggas better tryin'\nI make a getaway cleverly and never see time cause I'll RUN\n\nHook", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b61c84cf38b4d4f2133ce851fe5c6b1c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
