I'm dying to eat steak, with a mill in each safe\nA crib with a gate, so my kids can be safe\nTrying to fly straight, but these chances I take\nCould end a good night or ruin a nice day\nAnd watch it, you gonna see, you're barking up the wrong tree\nJust cuz I'm a seven time felon, homie\nIn addition to the lies snitches telling on me\nThat don't mean you can put the dope they was selling on me, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68262ccdcbffb87427d31b0d6085c2e3.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
