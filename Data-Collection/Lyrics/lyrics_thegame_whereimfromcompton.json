The true rap vet, pull up in two black Vettes, just me and Tommy\nA bunch of bounty hunters behind me\nDo it the ski mask way, I'm a legend in the making, go ask Jay\nBars smokin' hot like roaches in the ash tray\nKing amongst kings, just remember one thing\nMany tried and died, I'm speakin' on niggas that wanted my bling\nPull first, blast, I ended up takin' they shit\nBack to the studio, turn it up, back to makin' them hits\nI got two sons, two guns, used to beef with these two bums\nThought about lettin' off two shots to watch his crew run\nContimplated puttin' money on they head but it's just rap\nHit Nas, he told me \"don't get down like that\"\nIt's time to strategize, fuck bitches have 'em feed me grapes\nBut all I could do is think about this 40 eatin' your face\nYou mothafuckas just don't know how the beef was erased\nI ain't call him, he called Jeezy, Jeezy called so we straight\nFor now, but I still got one brow to the ceilin'\nAnd a loaded Glock .45 that's ready for peelin'\nI make a call, more killin', you make it out, Lord willin'\nSee life is a card game and I'm the mothafuckin' dealer\nI see you, where the killas? See your chain, where the millions\nWalk with me, I'll show you where Benjamin Franklin is livin'\n\n[Hook]\nCough up a lung, where I'm from\nCompton son, ain't nothin' nice\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fuck with the Kayslays the Clues, Drama the DJ Poohs\nWhether or not they fuck with me, I'm like Jay I will not lose\nBeen winnin' since the beginning, before Dre, before my records was spinnin'\nI was down in that chowls fuckin' the finest women\nAsk your favorite R&B bitches, pick one\nAny one, I dicked 'em, never licked 'em, she looked good till she spit cum\nUsed to bang her like a kick drum, she'd be screamin' and shit\nYellin' my name, just think ten years back I was dreamin' this shit\nThinkin' 'bout whippin' a sports car, you know the Beamer is sick\nBlowin' out the sunroof, gangsta leanin' and shit\nMaybe I'm trippin' cause gangbangin' was all I knew\nGrew up in a Crip neighborhood used to wanna be Snoop\nAfter my brother died I could've swore I would end up in blue\nWhoever knew young Jay would turn out to be a Piru\nStole a red rag from the liquor store and started a crew\nWhere gangbangin' is just somethin' to do\nMothafuckas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm from where the old people say \"put your gat away\" and they bang Donny Hathaway\nAnd the O.G.'s is trippin' cause lil niggas ain't wear they rag today\nSame 'hood where Game good\nSee yellow tape and white chalk where the lames stood, all the news reporters blame Suge\nSome niggas ain't from here and need a ghetto pass to come here\nWhere Old English is more than just a dumb beer\nGrew up across the tracks but I been on this side for some years\nWitnessed too much pain to tattoo it all in one tear\nSome niggas move away and never ever come back\nThey say Compton died with Eazy, guess who bringin' it back\nNo disrespect to other rappers I just made it here first\nInverse my verse you silly mothafuckas makin' it worse\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd823b680b687dac4f58ed6122bbab9b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
