At the time I never thought you was it\nI do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this\nA song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest\nAnd show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect\nFor women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife\nIntentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right\nNow every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret\n'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness\nI'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest\nWelcome to my life this is how painful my stories get\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow use this track as a lesson\nAll you guys out there who have some aggression\nTowards your woman it don't have to get hectic\nThat crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it\nI can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested\nThe only thing I could do is just make a track with a message\nAnd hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected\nI never meant to be that type of guy\nBut I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside\nI can cry at any moment just thinking about it\nSometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with\nI should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid\nSomebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it\nThe grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely\nShe won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me\nI'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me\nI swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nShe said, \"You never loved me, you just controlled me\nIf you fuck around I'm calling the police\"\nBut all I wanted to say was I'm sorry\nOh, how I wish that could tell you\n\n[Hook]\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you\nYou're gone, you're dead\nYou'll never know that I was sorry\nJust leave me alone, stay out my head\nI wish that I could tell you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
