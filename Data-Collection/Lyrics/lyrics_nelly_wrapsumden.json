We get that good herb and swerve\nTill the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd\nThat's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden)\nMake a nigga clap something, get all mad and slap something\nYo, grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors\nSee I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers\nSay dutch time, roll up it's clutch time\nAnd I burn mine, don't you ever, ever touch mine\nFire it up, dog, but watch out for 5-0\nEyes low from plenty Henny and hydro\nFuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich\nGo platinum and do some shows, and get blowed\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo\nIf I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more\nBut since I don't some might consider me slow\nDon't worry though\nI keep the pants sag, bubble eye hands rag\nEyes glassed smoking fill from the hash\nChoking after that but don't the blunt pass\n\"What we doin' today?\" Same shit we did last week\nWake up in the morning and yawn and roll up\nBag up and make some runs and roll up\n5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up\nOkay, made a left so continue to roll up\nDon't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them\nBut guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again\nCatch my second wind and start in on my next bag\nThe type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y\nAyo, this is no lie-ie-ie\nMe and my niggas gettin' high-igh-igh\nYo, if you look up in the sky-y-y\nYou might see us floating by-y-y", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7380d9314a012fbb969df4eb6d7ec650.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
