And cherry picking\nEvery lemon from your berry system\nThen proceed with the pack feeding\nWhen I was young I had visions of another world\nSneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother, hurled\nIncense smoke made vortices and other curls\nCasting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls\nI like my pancakes cut in swirls\nMoroccan moles and undercover squirrels\nI like cartoons, southern cities with large moons\nFaith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms\nApologize for my weird mix\nWhat taste like hot dogs and tear drips\nAnd looks like pantomime and clear bricks\nAnd smells like shotguns and deer piss\nThey on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard\nFirst part of a party, that I throw in parts\nOne minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts\nBut that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars\nI run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards\nFrom popular mechanics to overdosing hearts\nPaint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes\nNerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake\nA word game back up plan that can dam lakes\nBackup the wordplay playing at the man's states\nMeans I can still be the man if the dam breaks\nAnd when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face\nMy peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base\nThe unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine\nThat hovers above cities like weather men\nAnd maybe weather woman\nWhatever better to tell ya weather comin'\nI prefer girls to reign all over the world\nAnd not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance\nOr rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining\nOr rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man\nBut reign like Queens that reign over made man\nAnd not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen\nBut Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave\nSo you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, \"Hey man!\"\nAnd not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless\nYou gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress\nAnd treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements\nAnd especially when you're recording\nCause that's the portion that's important\nWhen I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than (poor)\nIt's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots\nCrying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops\nDeep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots\nA little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop\nAnd a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop\nAnd fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box\nSo the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops...\nThen it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox\nThen heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot\nCause he want what we got, like yeah\n\nThen forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey\nThen spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery\nNot scorching, nor sorbet-y\nFrom the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery\nComing down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall\nA more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll\nA river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival\nSwimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol\nSomebody give them the volleyballs\nIf you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's\nHomie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws\nComing out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras\nThe fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call\nMy rap position, was black condition, and activism\nAmmunition for abolition, missions attacking systems\nBut they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision\nAre we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?\nOperating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison\nChicken hackin\u2019 down-lowed updates that lack religion\nOr are we more...\n...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings\nPreoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?\nI sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings\nUhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it\nUnless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest\nBelieve all that, unless you Jewish\nLife is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus\nAnd I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris\nThe water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change\nMy chair position, or conditions of my porridge\nSubmission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus\nKeep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest\nAs I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form\nBury the hatchet, like how a bird born\nAs I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation\nHaving conversations with flavorful combinations\nSlave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands\nAnd two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood\nAnd, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks\nGiving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults\nRoad runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across\nAnomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir\nWildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor\nLevitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides\nBuckaroo roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides\nA thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes\nAnnouncing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies\nChocula Counts, by the count of five\nRefrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters\nIncinerator chutes and the manual for Contra\nAssorted memories from my childhood\nAbsorbing energy from the wild woods\nElectronic combat Konami sign contract\nChinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact\nChicago, spray gun aficionado\nEfficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano\nWho\u2019s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano\nDudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo\nPolarize envy of the older guys\nBlack obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives\nSub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well\nSound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells\nDodging rain and catching hail\nFaces need samurais to catch the L\nSpecial research vessels made for catching whales\nFilet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails\nRewrite history, liberty needs a better bell\nMaybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail\nSmarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale\nOr maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools\nTo announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school\nJust like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool\nCuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool\nYeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools\nSlipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel\nTechno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules\nWill have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood\nRoller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes\nOverweight taster of kings food that kills crews\nOblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu\nSimple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness\nReal still til' he realize his realness\nDefeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance\nYeah!\n\n[Produced by Wiz Buchanan, Keyz and Quality Kid for GITM]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a7f3f4969064ab39741b2f0bce0af3c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
