(Bullshittin')\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]\nHey, blow out your candles, make a wish\nWhat's a life if you never take a risk?\nAin't a place too far, ain't a dream too big\nAin't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (let's have some fun)\nAin't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun\n\n[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]\nIn my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y\nSabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)\nLong story short, that's one of my longterm goals\nMy anatomy is platinum, gold is old\nLettin' my hair swing like Pootie Tang\nI done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades\nAcute to cute bitches, niggas with drums\nNiggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade\nBut can't we all just get along?\nLike Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day\nShe say \"Soulo, you so crazy and deranged\", I say I know\nRoll that weed nigga! (Shake that ass hoe!)\nMost Dope, Top Dawg off the leash\nSounwave on the beat (Wizzo) and our key is anarchy\nYour confidence is caca compared to a kamikaze\nStill wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia\nSoul!\n\n[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]\nWhen I was just a kid\nDreamt that one day we'd all get rich\nNo more problems and no more tricks\nI set my sights high cause in my lifetime\nMan, I've seen some shit\nYeah, I swear to God\nI've seen some muthafuckin' shit\nWhatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

(In this)\nSwear to God, seen some shit\nLight a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nIn this lifetime, be the time of your life\nIt's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike\nAnd as a child, I was curious my mind was the dirtiest\nCurse words were probably my first words, affirmative\nMy home run derby shit, was makin' profit out the park\nEven the brightest mind will hang around at dark sometimes\nI had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize\nHad to write my wrongs, the day's short, the night's is long\nI'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish\nFrom gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger\nI'm a monster with the heart of a lion divide and conquer\nWalk on water, it won't be long till I flyin', that's my departure\nI'm a goner\nShootin' down from the sky with the eyes of an archer\nBetter find that thing you die for\nI don't know why what I get so high for\nI'm a problem and as hard as I try hiding from karma\nYou'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes\nThere was a time...\n\n[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]\nWhen I was just a kid\nDreamt that one day we'd all get rich\nNo more problems and no more tricks\nI set my sights high cause In my lifetime\nMan, I've seen some shit\nYeah, I swear to God\nI've seen some muthafuckin' shit\nWhatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?\n\n[Bridge: Mac Miler]\nTake your time\nDon't close your eyes\nLife happens in a flash\nAnd you don't wanna miss that\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]\nHey, blow out your candles, make a wish\nWhat's a life if you never take a risk?\nAin't a place too far, ain't a dream too big\nAin't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (let's have some fun)\nAin't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun\n\n[Post-Hook: Mac Miller]\nYeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)\nHow'd I end up in a place like this?

What's the difference?\nNothing at all! (Never mind us)\nAye, let me just add one more thing, Josh\nAye, aye, watch that shit man, you almost burnt me nigga!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3fafe062032c4ec3d42f4b11c25a02a1.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
