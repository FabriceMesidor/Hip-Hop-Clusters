I just wanted me a piece\nSlice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased\nThese boys snort lines, I'm fine just sippin' wine\nAmsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind\n\n[Hook]\nI'm Berry Gordy to the streets\nWith a kilo, so that boy had been a beast\nI wanna be there when each one of my kids born\nRoyal blood, hundred acres each to live on\nReal nigga to the day that I'm deceased\nEven then I pray I'm livin' through these beats\nDope boy, you can tell by my sneaks\nBurnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf\n\n[Verse 2]\nBorn in the bricks with the short end of the stick\nAlways runnin' late, quick to show up with your bitch\nThe Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish\nAll stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and\nRed carpet event, the marijuana be lit\nRed or blue, do you, as long as you're gettin' rich\nCrack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange\nRolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change\nThese niggas actin' like they want a war!\nWhen it come to whackin' niggas I done won awards\nNigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?\nI'm ridin' in some shit only I can afford\nShouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport\nAmsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour\nI'm laughin' at the people who label me poor\nNow I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn\n\n[Hook]\nI'm Berry Gordy to the streets\nWith a kilo, so that boy had been a beast\nI wanna be there when each one of my kids born\nRoyal blood, hundred acres each to live on\nReal nigga to the day that I'm deceased\nEven then I pray I'm livin' through these beats\nDope boy, you can tell by my sneaks\nBurnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf\n\n[Outro]\nI'm speakin' on unwritten laws, the code of the streets\nI'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him\nAnd do what the fuck you want to do\nNiggas like me, you gotta get permission homie\nAnd that could take a long time!\nIn that time, I'mma handle my motherfuckin' business..\nUgh! Ugh!\nIt's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam\nWherever the fuck I'm at\nIt's a no go\nWe green light you bitch niggas\nRozay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52547754f795d4ff94def40716ed3a2e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
