Is that an album? Shutup\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor your spot, for your top\nI'm off of mine\nI'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it\nI did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford\nCan you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?\nNext it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston\nI do this often, and shouts to Austin the video's awesome\nThey wanna know more, they wanna know why but he flossing\nNow you know I'm lying now you know I'm offing eat em up lunch em\nIf you fuck up better punch em' is that still a freestyle?\nIDK I eat cake, I still cake, with my bitch\nRipping off the top, throw up the fists for niggas that still rapping that bitch\nAttack shit all and stack shit, it's still so fun to play in my car\n\n[Outro]\nI'm coming for your spot, bitch\nI don't give a fuck about you or any of your shit that you...\nI'm coming for your spot", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db1a9643a028d62543e44c90da3a6ad.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
