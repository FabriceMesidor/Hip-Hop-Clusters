Yo, Ice is on the ground\nThe assassins, when they heard this up, stepped back and mixed in with the crowd\nGloom broke into hysteria, spot went wild\nA lot of bitches yelling and crying, while fake niggas smile\nI heard voices of my loved ones said I leave the party\nGod kisses my face as I leave my body\n\n[Interlude: Deuce Fever]\nYo, I wanna see what the fuck's happening!\nYo, yo, back off my man, man! (*Sample of L.A.P.D. sirens*)\nAwww shit! y'all\n\n[Chorus: Ice-T X2]\nThe game is real, anyone can get touched up\nGet moved on, left in a plunger blood\nNo matter how gangster you are, how deep your crew\nNiggas can get you if they want to\n\n[Verse Two: Mark Live]\nYo.. yo.. yo.. attack mode\nLook, listen, it's the general.. code\nGully and gutter, I roll with some box cutters\nI'm bringing.. fucking Jersey City niggas\nWe got.. tons of triggers, for tons of niggas\nWe walk and talk a lot, we run some niggas\nNo glitter and glades, it's guns and niggas\nNightclubs or your social clubs\nBackstage with your membrane, on the side of your freeway\nIt's ugly, the bomb squashed blonde bitch for our shit\nIt's M-16s switch off clips\nBullets ripped fleshy death right through your kids\nExcept your bids, except all that shit you did\nUhh.. you can't hide in the town houses\nWhen two niggas are nine-ing like two ounces\nScarface Colombia, Walker Tah's style surrounding, your white bitches out\n\n[Chorus: Ice-T X2]\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nNow, if you faggots got some questions about how real this is\nA straight Strong-Arm, half of you niggas in the biz'\nYour bodyguard, bitch made, motherfucking fake ass whores\nCan't even roll for dolo, walk through your own hood solo\nNiggas push up and change-snatch your logo\nThe truth is.. no homeboys are brought through\nYour own crew is destorying you\nSo now you're carrying guns, you know, you won't shoot\nYou copped a new whip, had to get a bulletproof\nYou wanted to be Rap-Star, now, you're too shook to move\nCause the streets say the words, you kid gotta prove\nLiving a lie, you might die, in this game of hot caption whores\nCheck your rearview you're being followed\n\n[Chorus: Ice-T X2]\n\n[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]\nEat the dick, if it be.. we gonna shoot from a block away\nWe keep with heat, and turn your face into a plot to play\nYeah, we spray out your feet and watch you burn in a flock away\nNerd, niggas stop and pray\nHeard, they can't drop the lay\nWe come out, run out, one route to Dun-house\nWe're about to blow his wig off \"yeah yeah\"\nNigga we jump out, pump out, dump out\nInfront of the Dun house with the sun-hounds\nShit to peel off and I'm.. running the trot like crooked cops\nTaking capes, pushing weight, while I shipped this back\nFrom California to the.. Hill Tah, Comille fitting dots\nActiville for them bills and he'll get drop\n\n[verse Five: Smoothe Da Hustler]\nLook I.. show guys and buyers we're not kidding\nI know the size, brothers stick-bys, when we start spitting\nThey go beside rocks and dodge with guns ticking\nBut it's devilish regardless the art is squash business\n\n[Chorus: Ice-T X2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/44e03781386ef22a962df8d6b6e26c72.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
