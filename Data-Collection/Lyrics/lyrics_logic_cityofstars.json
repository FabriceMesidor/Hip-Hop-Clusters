I penetrate it and innovate it\nWhile they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated\nI'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated\nBitch, I dominate it\nYeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID\nChilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E\nNot many get to do what I do, and now enemies\nThinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me\nBut let's get back to the music, I'm gone\nOutside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise\nLivin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet\nFuck all these cats on the internet\nI love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop\n'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot\n'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes\nPac did the same shit, just on a drum break\nNow, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game\nWe all people, all equal\u2014now let me let off, yeah\nNow let me let off\nTougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify\nTalib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by\nTwo words, Mos Def, in my headphones\nBlack on one side, now I'm in another zone\nSwitch flows, fuck 'em up\u2014play the game, run 'em up\nYeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck\nAll the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal\nAll the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?\nRacism on television and magazines\nPaying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn\nCountry don't give a fuck who I am\nJust a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand\nAnd I am, here's to the Roc\nThe .45 Glock that my older brother pop\u2014shot\nAnd I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop\nStop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap\nI am, livin' like I ain't got it\nSpit the flow so robotic, man, who gives a fuck about it?\nMaryland 'til I die, but I had to get the fuck up out it\nI love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b9b6844bdd8ebfbe10235ad54d885cfa.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
