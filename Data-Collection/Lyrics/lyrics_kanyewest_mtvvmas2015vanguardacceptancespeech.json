It\u2019s beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design.\n\nFirst of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I\u2019m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, \"Oh, you\u2019re not that bad after all.\" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?\n\nWould I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y\u2019all know y\u2019all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it\u2019s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.\n\nThe, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn\u2019t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy\u2019s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... \"SexyBack\" album, and bro\u2026.Justin I ain\u2019t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, \"He deserve to win Album of the Year.\"\n\nAnd this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I\u2019m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!\n\nI still don\u2019t understand award shows, I don\u2019t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don\u2019t understand it bro. I don\u2019t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don\u2019t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!\n\nTwo thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite. Y\u2019all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen tonight, I don\u2019t know what's going to happen tomorrow bro.\n\nBut all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don\u2019t never, you know what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We\u2019re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we\u2019re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m finna lose after this. It don\u2019t matter though, it ain\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.\n\nAnd yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President.", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/4e451665e8bb95c7925b8bbfadd49270.600x334x1.png"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
