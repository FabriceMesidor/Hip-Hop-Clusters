I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?\nKnowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?\nPlus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing\nAnd probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string\nBut I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you\nI'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92\nSo everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you\nAnd maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues\n\n[Hook]\nCause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here\nI remember how it was, how it was when you were young\nYesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now\nDon't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more\n\n[Outro]\nYou fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck\nAnd by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun\nIf you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch\nNext time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it\nYou wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot\nYou fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt", "image": "https://images.genius.com/80fdb6f9c162a3849e2c111cba08a234.500x476x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
