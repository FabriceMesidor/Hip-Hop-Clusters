Not why?\nWe fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high\nFuck it, everybody to the library\nGot a new batch, some blue, booberry\nStuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day\nIt's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines\nRichie Valens ?\nI'm so lifted, like a parachuter\nMy grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller\nSlip away, dip away, almost had to throw a wholezip away\nBut fuck that, this the Taylor gang, what you on dog\nShit I'm on everythang\n\n[Chorus]\nNever have never will\nYou niggas never have never will\nYou niggas never have never will\nI said you niggas never have and you never will\nYou niggas never have and never will\nYou niggas never have and never will\nBig Snoop and young Wiz smokin' kill kill kill kill\nYou niggers still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas\nHoller at me when you graduate\nWe'll be posted right by the four hundred building\nRoom four twenty, follow your nose\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c99dd335733f9c3cf16f57c9f589cfb.361x361x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
