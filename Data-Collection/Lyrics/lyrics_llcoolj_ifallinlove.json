I want \"One More Chance\"\nI got questions, you got the answers\nYour body is a {?} but you have to master\nI'm not your slave but I'm willin to play\nI'll search for oil, start drillin away\nTurn off your iPhone, we chillin and hey\nWe'll be sippin Patron, couple gallons a day\nLet's take our clothes off, bombs away\nPick a song, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo or Ray J\nTo get you in the mood, now you ready to play\nCome to my house, put your clothes away\nThere's no commitment, you don't have to stay\nJust come with me, I'll set you free\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Interlude: LL Cool J]\nWHAT CAN I DO?!\nI'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!\nWHAT CAN I DO?!\nI'M IN LOVE WITH YOU~! (Stop playin girl)\n\nThe more I look at you, the more I get\nHypnotized, my nature rise\nBefore your eyes, I know you're sick\nOf all the lies and alibis\nFrom other guys, when I'm watchin you\nI get energized, I realize\nWe need surprise, variety\nIs the spice of life, so I eat you up\nLike apple pie, I like your flow\nYou're the star, this is your show\nSpeed it up, take it slow\nPush it out, take it low\nThat helps a love like this to grow\nIf you're feelin me girl let me know\nI know that you are respectable\nBut this type of healin is sexual\n\n[Chorus] + [Interlude]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
