down the block, they showin' pictures of me\nStash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet\nFirst one with the Rollie with the hundred carets\nI'mma make it work, I'mma make it work\nDiamonds all on my hands, know I make it work\nI'mma make it work, time to make it work\n100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work\n\n[Break: Rick Ross]\nDo your job and I'mma do mine\nFrom the dice to the diamonds\nMatchbox to the penthouse\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nThey askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me\nRidin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me\nStash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet\nFirst one with the Rollie with the hundred carets\nI'mma make it work, I'mma make it work\nDiamonds all on my hands, know I make it work\nI'mma make it work, time to make it

with meI clip niggas\nCheck this I get money ain't told no snitch nigga\nYou mad cause I'm on now get my dick sucked like a rich nigga\nMove work like '88, cuban link like '92\nMove weight like Ricky Lake, my chick, 10, 5 times 2\nDo I have to remind you what that 45 and that 9 do\nPull up in the Maybach with that thing back and recline you, pussy\nI'mma make it work, I'mma make it work\nPussy

Hardaway\nCross nigga y'all fraud niggas, I fade away and you ball away\nPlease tell me where shawty stay please tell me where shawty live\nYour boyfriend be past tense cause my stroke game might pass your ribs\nOh, oh fuck 'em up, oh, oh, fuck with me\nBlue oh, she comfortable with you she 17\nI'm the man to see when you in DC\n[?] Trel in the [?]\nI'm either Malcom or Martin shawty I still talk to my enemies\nMMG you end the beef MMG we still a team\nI've been rocking with the 3rd ward since new Girbauds and Soulja Rees\nBosses out call Ross out and [?] get the Porshe up\nCall the hood get a black bottle like a nigga got an endorsement\nGive her dick cause she gorgeous can't give her my joystick\nYoung Bre keeps gunplay still down for that extortion\nThey want shit I got\n\n[Hook: Rick

room like it was Set It Off\nDolphins 75% fuck all the politics\nBetter take us to the playoffs so I fuck your bitch\nShootin' dice with all my woes, we at the Superbowl\nI'm like the title, I'm the one these niggas shootin' for\nObama let my niggas go, change all the crack laws\nWhen movie come on boy, we rebuildin' the match box\nOn my knees at night, prayin' all my niggas safe\nAsk God bless a nigga with a bigger safe\nBlue cheese got it drippin' out the shoebox\nTake off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac\nI show my abs like I'm 2Pac\nTake off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nThey askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me\nRidin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me\nStash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet\nFirst one

I'mma make it work\n\n[Verse 4: Rick Ross]\nPulled up in Miami and told you niggas I'mma do it big\nHundred rooms, still addin' on to my crib\nEverybody take a loss, I gotta make it work\nI done see niggas have to tuck in they shirt\nI got the (?) my nigga I'm bout to flip again\nHundred mil off shore accounts and start over again\nI blow the dice, drop the diamonds, and just let 'em roll\nGot her heart beatin' fast but we fuckin' slow\nCrippin' every major city, keep it to yourself\n(?) young nigga wealth\nGet me a motor with no trannie, I'mma make it work\nWatch me pull up in a Caddy baller alert\nIt's a cold game, it's why we pull the minks on\nBlack market so we gotta out the rings on\nI'm on a different thing let these niggas sing more\nThe pinky ring, the diamond watch, the
