I shoot but I don't do it with cameras\n(Nope!) So you can call me Malcolm\nYou can all witness what I be doin' to all of these rappers (yes!)\nWith y'all sloppy tactics; don't try to copycat me\nIf you ain't tryna box me back\nAnd watch your back, don't take another look into the eyes\nOf a nigga that's willin' to ride 'til he blind\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck a hook... fuck a hook...)\nChka-chka-chka, Royce... 5... 9!\nYeah, and it's on\n(Fuck a hook... fuck a hook... fuck a hook...)\nChk-chka-chka-chka\nI will rhyme all day, yes!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll show you the back of your brain\nSlap you with the back of the gun\nClap you when the rappin' is done\nI aim to hit, I pack MACs, accurate ones\nChange the clip, I send rappers back where they from\nChangin' fast, the game I ask is not a sport\nI'm tired of bein' a fuckin' day late and a dollar short\nAnd I'm back! All of you rap niggas hide your mics\nI'm ridin', dyin', and I ain't flyin' by on them bikes\nI'm walkin', talkin', you eye me you dyin' tonight\nThis iron is showin' you the shine designed by Christ\nAnd I am the head reaper about the sick shit\nYou about to see dead people without the \"Sixth Sense\"\nAnd yeah, takin' food off my mother's table'll\nGet you killed regardless like my brother's label\nMy heart and arteries a part of me that'll test the truest\nWe can do it, put your vest into it, yeah\n\n[Hook]\n(Fuck a hook... fuck a hook... fuck a hook...)\nChka-chka-chk\n(\"You don't wanna play with him today\")\nYeah, No!\nYeah, hardcore!
