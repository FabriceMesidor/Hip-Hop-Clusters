Ludacris is almost out of his deal\nI'm over ten million sold, every album is crack\nAnd for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my back\nMad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom\nThough I make big money, still handle small problems\nThe ramblin at the mouth, I don't play that shit\nI'm the best and I ain't really gotta say that shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57e6650f3864beef0e227e02f76d83b0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
