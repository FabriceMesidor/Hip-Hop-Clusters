health\nLet's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself\nCause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and\nWhich I create, cause that's my mission\nSo listen close, to what we say\nBecause this type of fag claims to never be gay\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI knew you was jealous from the day that I met you\nI upset you, cause I get respect, I bet you\nI'm even liked better by your niece and nephew\nAnd now you hate Fred because Lethal left you\nPeckerwood mad cause his record went wood\nNo respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods\nGot in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood\nAnd said, \"Heck, country western rap records are good\"\nSo he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes\nHe can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both\nPuts an album out and rules for part of the year\nThen Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere\nIt's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year\nNo one's tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair\nSittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear\nSo you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea\nFigure you can diss me to jump start your career\nI punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear\nAnd fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew\nLike I'mma say they names so they can be famous too\n\n[Chorus 1: Eminem]\nYou just a Quitter and you bitter cause I came along\nAnd the days of House of Pain are gone\nAnd if you talk about my little girl in a song again\nI'mma kill you, I'mma kill you\nYou just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along\nAnd the days of House of Pain are gone\nAnd if you talk about my little girl in a song again\nI'mma kill you, I'mma kill you\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nHeart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke\nTo the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke\nAnd I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth\nThe reason why you dissed me first and I answered you\nYou said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you\nLike I ain't notice you, bitch, I had a show to do\nLike I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you\nYou better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two\nBack in '94 Limp opened the show for you\nRocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you\nTook your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too\nSo you fall in a slump and get all emotional\nSo now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings\nConfused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick\nMr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker\nBut never last, and Everlast is a\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nQuitter and you bitter cause I came along\nAnd the days of House of Pain are gone\nAnd if you talk about my little girl in a song again\nI'mma kill you, I'mma kill you\nYou just a quitter and you bitter cause I came along\nAnd the days of House of Pain are gone\nAnd if you talk about my little girl in a song again\nI'mma kill you, I'mma kill you\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAight look, so this is what we ask of our fans\nIf you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass\nHit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him\nKick him, spit on him, treat him like a ho, bitch-slap him\nDo it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp\nDo it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid\nDo it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it\nHe's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin\nShit in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's\nAnd he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets\n\n[Interlude 1: Eminem]\nAyo, fuck this, cut this shit off\nAyo Head\nThat's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker\n\n[Part II: Hit 'Em Up (Remix)]\n\n[Intro 2: Eminem]\nKill Whitey (hahaha!)\nKill Whitey, Detroit\nKill Whitey, yo, yo\nKill Whitey, haha, look\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nFirst off, fuck your songs and the shit you say\nDiss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay\nYou claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White\nSo fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight\nPlus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip\nWhitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead\nI keep 'em comin while you runnin' out of breath\nSteady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest\nDilated, go ask your people how I leave ya\nWith your three CDs nobody sees, when they released\nEvidence, don't fuck around with real MCs\nYou ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks\nI let you faggots know it's on for life\nBut Everlast might die tonight, haha!\nFat boy murdered on wax and killed\nFuck with me and take a heart pill, you know\n\n[Chorus 2: Eminem]\nGrab .380s when you see Slim Shady\nCall the doctor to heal your heart\nThey shocked you back to life at the clinic\nBut you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up\n\n[Interlude 2: Eminem]\nHahaha, yo check this out\nYou faggots ain't even on my level\nI'mma let D12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots\n\n[Verse 5: Kon Artis]\nYo, get out the way yo, get out the way yo\nWhitey Ford's heart just stopped\nEminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack\nWhitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin' back\nLittle faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are\nAt your own restaurant, while I'm servin' ya\nDrop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops\nCall the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch\n\n[Verse 6: Kuniva]\nHa ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik\nWhere's your House of Pain now? It's only one of you Erik\nYou a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round\nWith some killers from 7 Mile to the muhfuckin' Belle Isle Bridge\n\n[Chorus 2: Eminem]\nGrab .380s when you see Slim Shady\nCall the doctor to heal your heart\nThey shocked you back to life at the clinic\nBut you 'bout to get relapsed any minute, honkey, I hit 'em up\n\n[Verse 7: Eminem]\nGot in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still\nThis ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin' killed\nWith his chest open, tryin to throw a fuckin' punch\nBut you just chokin', having a stroke\nAnd now you learn why crackers never earned a dime\nCause you suck, motherfucker you should learn to rhyme\nTalkin' about you packin' pistols but it's funny to me\nYou ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me\nI'm a paleface killer whale\nOn his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail\nErik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?\nThat shit was obvious, you probably was gay\nNow it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop\n49,000 copies the week your shit drop\nWhile my sales making records break\n2.5 million scanned by the second week\nMotherfucker I hit em up\n\n[Verse 8: Proof]\nI'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave where bullets tear you in half\nFuck the music, we got a Uzi for all you fags\nGet the shit out of our stereo, Dilated, you violated\nNow you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you\nErik's irons get choked up and yoked up\nAll you underground bitches get your throats cut\n\n[Verse 9: Swifty]\nWhat the fuck, is you stupid? I choke Whitey Ford\nWith his fucking guitar cord and stuff him in cardboard\nChopped up in a box, with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart\nD-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch\nKeep your restaurant locked and block your door\nCause we hit 'em up like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur\n\n[Verse 10: Eminem]\nYou a, Black Jesus, heart attack, seizures\nToo many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases\nWhite devil, washed up honkey\nMixed up cracker who crossed over to country\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nYo, ayo cut this shit off\nSheeeit! Fuck him!\nThat's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done\nThat's it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise\nI just believe in kicking a man while he's down\nGoddamn!
