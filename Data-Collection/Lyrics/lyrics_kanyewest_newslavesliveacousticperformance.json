Fur coat? A diamond chain?\nAll you blacks want all the same things\"\nUsed to only be niggas, now everybody playin'\nSpendin' everything on Alexander Wang\nNew Slaves\n\n[Bridge] (2x)\nYou see there's leaders and there's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\n\n[Verse 2]\nI throw these Maybach keys\nI wear my heart on the sleeve\nI know that we the new slaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nI know that we the new slaves\nI see the blood on the leaves\nThey throwin' hate at me\nWant me to stay at ease\nFuck you and your corporation\nY'all niggas can't control me\nI know that we the new slaves\nI know that we the new slaves\nI'm 'bout to wild the fuck out\nI'm goin' Bobby Boucher\nThey throwin' pussy at me\nI know that pussy ain't free\nI know that pussy ain't free\n\n[Verse 3]\nNew slaves\nAnd your brand new car\nNew slaves\nWith your brand new job\nIts still a new slave\nNo matter who you are\n\n[Bridge] (2x)\nYou see there's leaders and there's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\n\n[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]\nI won't end this high, not this time again\nSo long, so long, so long, you cannot survive\nAnd I'm not dyin', and I can't lose\nI can't lose, no, I can't lose\nCause I can't leave it to you\nSo let's get too high, get too high again\n(Too high again, too high)\n\n[K\u00f3bor J\u00e1nos]\nEgyszer a Nap \u00fagy elf\u00e1radt\nElaludt m\u00e9ly z\u00f6ld t\u00f3 \u00f6l\u00e9n\nAz embereknek f\u00e1jt a s\u00f6t\u00e9t\n\u0150 megsajn\u00e1lt, elj\u00f6tt k\u00f6z\u00e9nk", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2079d2b823446e61aa3170f774661154.500x281x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
