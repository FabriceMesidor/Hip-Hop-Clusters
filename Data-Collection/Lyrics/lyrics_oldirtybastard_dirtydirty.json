You out of your mind\nCuz I stay on track, like transit line\nKeep it nappy or braided up\nDirty in the cockpit, blazin' up\nStop frontin' when you made it up\nTellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up\nHah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites\nStill trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss\nYou know why niggas don't give you much respect\nCuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat\nKnow Dirt, like bow know death\nWhen I'm huntin' down, birds of rap\nHate Dog, cuz I ate your cat\nAnd you can eat my ass and have a coke with that\nUse a spoon, unless you want a fork\nPull my dick out, watch the room get dark\nStay high with the zombie walk\nGotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks\n\n[Hook 2X: high pitched female (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]\nDirty Dirty, you tell me how you do it\nIt look so easy, like there was nothin' to it\nBut they don't understand, about the Dirty M.C\nIt's the....
