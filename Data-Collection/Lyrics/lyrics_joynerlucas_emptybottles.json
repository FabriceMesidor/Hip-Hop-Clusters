Fuck, I messed up, I tried my best\nI admire my best cause they say the best things come straight from the chest\nAlmost caught a bullet went straight through my chest\nSo thankful vest and thank to the chick who played me and made me realize I ain't shit\nJust a nigga trynna make it and if I got imma take it, if you got it imma chase it\nImma robber in the making, but my head keep ringin'. Heh\nSomebody talkin' about me again probably just another nigga trynna out me again\nProbably just a hater that just won't allow me to win\nGot me sippin' on this bottle of gin, thinkin' bout my role model again\nBut what would my nana think if I was following him?\nStaring at these twin hollows again damn\nWhat a nigga gotta do to make life worth livin'?\nIs worth life livin',  I ain't like most niggas Iont think that\nMe and you cool, I mean we used to back when you was you and I'm still the same\n\nA lot of people change, with a whole lot lose and a whole lot to gain that's just game, that's just the game\nWe all gonna break, I stay rollin' up, I hate growin' up\nBut wait hold it up, damn look at yo smile, I love it when you smile\nYeah, I love it when you smile, it reminds me of a child\nIt remind me of a child, it remind of the belt and I probably like you cause you remind me of myself\nI'm all grown up, you all grown up\nDon't cry though we been through a lot, so what?\nWe can make it through whatever, that's what I used to tell you, whenever you was down\nBut now it's whatever and everytime I talk to you, shit, it's whatever, whatever\nBut I can't say I wish I never met you, but I wish I never wish I let you get the best of me ever\nWhatever, might as well say goodbye to yourself cause in the end\nAll a nigga really got is himself, true, I used to be down with O.P.P\nUntil other people's personalities told me some otherwise but otherwise don't quote me\nShow me, I never let a nigga control me, that's O.D. what\nAnd Imma tell you like, Barack told me\nHeh heh listen check, I gotta call em' like I see em\nLil cousins only two swearin' next time imma teach him\nKids only three cursin' that's what y'all teach em\nTurn around and beat him kinda hard to believe it\nCut friends off cause Ion't really need em plus Iont really seem em\nAnd iont wanna be em\nI want a relationship, but I don't really need it now\nCause I got two reasons, Iont trust nobody and you ont trust me either and I don't blame you\nCause I don't trust me neither, anything you could do, I could do sweeter\nAnd revenge is sweet, sweet like sugar, Ice tea can't (unavailable)\nI don't want to hear all of that shit, word", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c85e5ff7768da914af18e07c14fca52.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
