bringing pain like two bad nurses\nIn the pain from these here motherfuckin' verses\nRidiculous thirstses involving hearses\nTo the dirt shit first picks and usin' autos to work with\nSlugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)\nI\u2019m hitting it with an expert kick\nAnd burst 'til the earth split leave you hurt bitch\nShow you how worser than worst get in the zone\nSee the vein when the pain repel\nAnd then they closin' the curtains bitch\n(When adrenaline's pumpin')\nI don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit\nI'm a misunderstood nigga, and I'm off my square\nHigh got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit\n\n[Twista]\nWhat can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel\nTo make me wanna jump off of the edge?\nI\u2019m charged up like Scarface gettin' shot up on the ledge\nNo pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head\n(So tell me what it said)\nRetaliate with lethal repercussion\nI feel the reefer rushin'\nTo go into thangs like it's a wicked stick\nTook the Benadryl, hot like I'm finna steal\nTo get the kickin' shit\nFor niggas and bitches that I kick it with\nI was born to get you pumped up\nIt's like some lead bust\n'Cause I give motherfuckers a head rush\nThen yo' heads bust when you jumped up\n'Cause what I said must've got you geeked\nMy eyes red, puffed\nFrom smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die\nMake me wanna slip the clip on the side\nAnd if you act a bitch on the side\nIf we have to then the whole Westside'll let the shit go on\nAnd ride when the trigga bust\n\n[Hook: Twista & Yung Buk]\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nPullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick\nI'm ready to start shit\nStarted buryin' some heads like an ostrich\nUnload the whole cartridge\nAnd throw the shells in the garbage\nThe hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve\nWhat I've accomplished\nYung Buk's my accomplice\nLocated his existence with my sixth sense like a compass\nAnd started on a journey to establish to stop this\nWorshipped in the hearts of all the niggas to get 'em charged\nWhat's the real reason?\nAll you haters tried to murder me, so now it's kill season\nAnd even though I'm still bleedin'\nI'ma keep comin' because I'm still breathin'\nAnd y'all can't trace me\nI'm burying my victims in the wall like Gacy, too lyrical\nAnd since the snip of my umbilical, these flows been critical\nMy music is miracle, it's like I'm biblical\nKill like I'm nuttier than Buddy Love\nAnd still wouldn't leave a bloody glove\nAnd start the truck up\nAnd speed the fuck up\nGetaway, smokin' the blunt up\nAdrenaline pumpin' veins, erupt, I'm pumped up\n\n[Yung Buk]\nAnd I'm calibrated at 360 degrees\nSee that's 300 niggas that's gon' die\n'Bout 60 slugs to do this deed\n(Psycho Drama)\nWe too much for the industrialist to fuck with this\nOn the brink of fuckin' up some shit\nDismantle, deduct some shit\nIt's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do\n(What niggas got nerves to do)\nSo I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you\nThen think what I'm on the verge to do\nAnd I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo' curtains fool\nFrom killin' the verses fool\nI be one of the worstest, dude\n(You the who?)\nI'm the worstest\nLook about 9 millimeters above your surface\nUnleash these thangs then I defeat yo' purpose\nBitch you hurtin'\n\n[Hook: Twista & Yung Buk]\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\nLet your adrenaline rush\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\nLet your adrenaline rush", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d3d24875934a3f4e43760767e5f7584d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}],
