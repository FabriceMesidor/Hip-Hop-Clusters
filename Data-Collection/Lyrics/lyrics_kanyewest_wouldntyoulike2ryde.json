Dep\nThen I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina\n\n[Hook]\nWould you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"\nLike a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"\n\n[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]\nMalik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name\nThe most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game\nI give you words spit with flames\nStay to myself and let nerves mix with lames\nConnoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame\nI used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb\nBut my job was to hustle 'dro\nNow an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow\nNever a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe\nNow you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go\nI would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends\nBut the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side\nAnd I no longer like you\nFuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nDeep as the ocean is the motion of life\nThought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife\nNot knowin' you was trife\nStiflin' a nigga's growth\nAll you wanna do is shop at River Oaks\nWatch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke\nI'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope\nThought my real nigga quotes would make you truer\nYou ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor\nThe sex is good, but you ain't a shooter\nThere's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper\nI look through the mirror and see my reflection\nIt ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend\nReturned to my Bishop Juan ways goin' Wild West like Kanye\nWherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit I'm grown\nBroke broad I'mma leave your ass alone\nYou still wanna ride though\n\n[Hook]\nWould you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"\nLike a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"\nWould you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"\nLike a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away\n\"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends\"\n\"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b7758602aa6883d6e056a8f30703a549.591x591x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
