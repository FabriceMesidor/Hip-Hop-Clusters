Play like Jasmine Guy and try me\nI'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G\nThey got my homies in a jail cell\nAnd it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell\nI got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers\nAnd nuttin but love for each other\nSo motherfucker make a motion\nI give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean\nTemperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga\nBut they hate it when we pop the cops\nThat's when they gettin' petrol\nYou better watch your step or you'll be left on death row\nBut I learn to look ahead of me\nStay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy\nWe blowin' up precincts and OOOH\nYou can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too\n\n[Hook]\nIt's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do\nAnd stay a crooked nigga too\nAnd maybe then you'll see the truth, OOOH!\nBut until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too\nIt's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do\nAnd stay a crooked nigga too\nAnd maybe then you'll see the truth, OOOH!\nYou can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aff64f752ccfff1d48590e5db3c0357a.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
