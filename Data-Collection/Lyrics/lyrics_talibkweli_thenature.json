Don't nobody talk no more they all text message\nDrivin and typin, not payin attention, missin they next exit\nDependin on navigation they ever know where they goin\nThey stayin stuck in one spot they not growin\nI'm so over cryin, waitin and hopin playin the blame game\nThe game changed me into +A Different World+ like Dwayne Wayne\nI'm gettin high just to maintain (yeah)\nTake my music like a drug and drop the needle in the same vein\nI get a rush like I'm tweekin off blow\nExcept it ain't via the nose it's from deep in my soul\nThe street slang I be speakin in code\nKick in the do's, freakin the flow 'til the speakers explode\nWe in control, the people know I speak the truth\nThe power of my roots is thicker than sour sop\nAnd they so strong they bustin out the flower pot\nFamily tradition is to tell 'em you love 'em\nWhile your family livin from granny in the kitchen the little man in prison\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Justin Timberlake]\nI'm just tryin to get back, to what really matters\nI'm tryin to search my soul to find out, what I'm after\nBut the more I find my voice the more they try to make it harder\nSo mom and dad don't forget to warn your sons and daughters\nAbout the-na-ture-of, the world today, the nature of the world today\nThe-na-ture-of, the world today, the nature of the world today\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYeah, it's all natural baby\nIt's how we put it there\nYeah, Brooklyn to Tennessee\nYou goin up with me\nYeah, yeah, break it down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36dc52e92a9d27102149cf08b1a7f326.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
