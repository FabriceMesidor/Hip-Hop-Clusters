Can I get a do over?\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nAiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend\nCheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking\nShe broke down and cried, and it hurt so bad\nHer friends went and told her I was a brand new dad\nOf course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag\nMy excuse was I couldn't cum like that\nShe warned me of days like this, if this should happen\nShe'll be out, and we'd be the ones sharing the napkin\nSilly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions\nDon't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothin'\nBut brought to the world, innocent, two month old little girl\nBut what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo\nIt's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew\nThrowing a baby up to someone I hardly knew\nNah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo? I lost my jewel\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nAiyo, I wrote this right here, on the bus to Rikers\nRight next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers\nFor mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain\nAnd the worst time to leave you, now\nI'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me\nI appreciate your concern and support for me\nMost important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible\nThis the truth spilling out of my guts\nIf I, would of took the chance to see\nWhat was place right in front of my face\nFor sure, nine out of ten times\nMy actions wouldn't allow me to be so naive\nAnd blind, to carry out these mistakes\nI'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun\nFor me, my rep on the streets like touching the sun\nYou like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you\nThanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]\nShe was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block\nThrowing out my Timbos, and all my clothes\nShe said, F*** my, apoligies\nShe said, the lies won't fit those\nAnd I said, baby, now let me explain\nI know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing\nSo take all the time you need and desire\nAnd if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Ghostface Killah]\nHello baby, I'm sorry for everything that just been going on lately\nYou know, I've kinda been stressed out\nI've been thinking about the things I did to you lately and\nNot listening when you was telling me to chill\nNow I wind up in here, it's like\nYou remember, listen boo, listen\nThe way you rub my face, the way you talk to me\nThe way you look at me, I know ain't no girl in the world gon' ever give me that\nLike the way you gave it to me\nSo right now I'm pleading, and this is my word on everything\nI'm on my knees, babe, just take me back, give me one chance\nI'm asking for a do over...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea54fa933d61e534fbf14d9509cc7146.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
