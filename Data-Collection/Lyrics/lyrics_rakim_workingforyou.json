I know I've got explaining to do\nI've got some problems but none of them pertaining to you\nIt's mostly money, bills, warrants that's just naming a few\nI ain't complaining just let me win the game and I'm through\nI get my shit together stop living off the corner\nGet the majority of my priorities in order\nAnd in my goal is find a way to get you out the slums\nSo we can roll through the neighborhood without the guns\nAnd the grind my days is limited, sinning and crime\nTime is money but you wonder how I'm spending my time\nAm I really stacking paper or I'm bending a dime\nThat's propaganda try not to let that enter your mind\nYo hon, you listening? 'Cause when it come to flipping ones\nAnd getting bundles in the jungle I've got tunnel vision\nJust stay focused there's a lot of road\nI bridge the gap to get a lot of dough\nJust help me with this pot of gold\nCause you was there when the feds hit me\nWe took our vows in the penals\nSo you could do my bid with me\nPrivate, visits to jail you had a kid with me\nNow it's time to get the crib with me, live with me, come on\n\nI've been working for you doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time) (X4)\n\nIf you don't hear from me, call the priest and don't think papi cheating\nIf I ain't there something happened to me, the block is heated\nJust go in the ceilings and the boxes and the closets keep it\nI hid the yearly profits we get in the Sealy Posturepedic\nI got to leave it drugs squeezing guns and the ghetto\nLast thing I wanna do is leave you a young widow\nBut the scent of papi's easy Miyagi still on the pillow\nSo I'mma find a way to survive and stay alive\nDon't let the Lexus scare you just let it just prepare you\nI spraying nine's some thorough plus I'm extra careful\nGot something good waiting for me you know I'll be there boo\nIncredible head to toe plus the sex is rare too\nGot you the cranberry Benz you say yeah I'm happy\nBut you don't want nothing if you can't have me\nSo I'mma switch the gig when I get rich from this\nThen go legit and handle businesses, kiss the kids\n\nI've been working for you doing all I can (all I can)\nAll the time (all the time) (X4)\n\nI ball for you, score for you, mall for you\nI say I'm sorry, but at times I was wrong for you\nGet into your beef for you, plus, I be loyal\nI go gutter free for you, even flush a key for you\nRight now, I'm ready to change my lifestyle\nPipe down for you, lay the pipe down for you\nEven call free for you, all week for you\nLay off the heat for you, stay off the street for you\nI'll take you out for lunch, anything you want\nWithout the front for you, put out the blunt for you\nMake sure you safe and sound, stay around for you\nYou gonna love the way your man lay it down for you\nHey, yo, hey, ma, everything is\u2014uh huh, you got to know it\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a5928958bdda95a9493e76a22eeb4be.588x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
