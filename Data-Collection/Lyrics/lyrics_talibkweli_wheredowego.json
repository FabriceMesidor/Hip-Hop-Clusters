What do we do?\nNowhere to turn, nowhere to run and there's nothin new\nWhere do we go for inspiration?\nIt's like pain is our only inspiration\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYea, I see a place where little boys and girls\nAre shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl\nNo one to hold 'em while they growin\nThey livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world\nNow, if I could help it I tell it just like it is\nAnd I may say some things that you don't like to hear\nI know this: that people lie, people kneel\nPeople die, people heal, people steal, and people shed tears\nWhat's real, blood spills, gun kill, the sun still\u2014rise\nAbove me, trust me, it must be, morning\u201atime\nWake up, the stakes up\nEverybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew\nBut when the karma come back for what you do\nIt's too late to make up\u2014some excuse\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nI come from people who stronger than time and space\nWherever there's competition you gonna find the race\nI find a place in my heart for this hip-hop\nAnd pump blood through my vein my skin get hot\nI take you very serious and make you write more\nIf I don't celebrate I got nothing to fight for\nI'm tight raw, excite y'all like nightfall\nI'm tight y'all, I walk the street like y'all\nAbout action, talk is cheap, right y'all?\nYou start yappin' think about the beef you might cause\nThe trouble you could get into\nYou don't study, you not prepared and cats is testin you\nWhat you gonna do when you gotta face\nThe manifestation of the words that you put in space\nThey already there you can't take 'em out\nThe studio gangsta inside you tryin' to break out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYea, I see a place where little boys and girls\nAre shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl\nNo one to hold 'em while they growin\nThey livin' moment to moment without a care in the whole world\nNow, if I could help it I tell it just like it is\nAnd I may say some things that you don't like to hear\nI know this: that people lie, people kneel\nPeople die, people heal, people steal, and people shed tears\nWhat's real, blood spills, gun kill, the sun still\u2014rise\nAbove me, trust me, it must be, morning\u2014time\nWake up, the stakes up\nEverybody want the cake up, to break up with the crew\nBut when the karma come back for what you do\nIt's too late to make up\u2014some excuse", "image": "https://images.genius.com/639d018fa60e7677cf3ab227ccd69dfc.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
