In a fitted hat and a hunch back\nStandin' by the clearance coat rack\nIn some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs\nYeah\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nShady in the place to be seen\nAnd i got what it takes  to rock the mic right\nStill not gonna cater these punks\nFuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b2fc4394cc56a6f77214822bce31cd00.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
