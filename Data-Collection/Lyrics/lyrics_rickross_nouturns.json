You better stay there\nYou switch sides? You better stay there\nSwitch sides? You better stay\nSwitch sides you better stay there\nYou switch sides? You better stay there\nSwitch sides? You better stay there\n\n[Verse 1]\nTunnel vision, it's time to stumble on 100 million\nI still remember niggas pissin' in the project buildings\nIt's do or die, mama say can't have no feelin's\nCause the pretty boys in caskets never been appealin'\nThat diamond ceilin', all you hear is SUUUU\nIt got the bitches like OOOOO\nPhotographic memories, millionaire tendencies\nI still be havin' dreams of niggas killin' me\nSwitchin' sides, you should be happy just to be alive\n40 shots ready to show you niggas how we ride\nWeather man weapons we use, them bitches never jam\nWalk up on you, pull up on you, won't leave no evidence\n\n[Hook]\nAin't no U turns on the block\nIt ain't no U turns on my block\nAin't no U turns on my block\nAin't no U turns on my block\nIt ain't no U turns on my block\nIt ain't no U turns on the block\nAin't no U turns on the block\nIt ain't no U turns on the block\nIt ain't no U turns on the block\n\n[Bridge]\nSwitch sides? You better stay there\nYou switch sides? You better stay there\nSwitch sides? You better stay\nSwitch sides you better stay there\nYou switch sides? You better stay there\nSwitch sides?
