No\nWhoa, like the opposite of go\nThat ain't how it's supposed to be or butterfly\nBut for the sake of rhymin', let's just say butterfly-ee\nThe truth stings like Muhammad Ali\nI tell 'em, tell 'em don't homicide me\nI'm just a little old hope with his back against the ropes\nFightin' for his fans and fightin' for his folks\nBut the boos from the crowd can become so loud\nIf I can block 'em out then, I could knock 'em out and\nDance around the ring but until then I'll sing\n\n[Hook]\nI'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me\nIt is what it is and it's how it's gon' be\nUntil I get there\nTill I get there\nAnd yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect\nBut all the ups and downs will soon be worth it\nWhen I get there\nWhen I get there, whoa, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nDoctor, doctor please, the fame ain't painless enough\n\"That's cause you ain't famous enough\nYou got a little game but your name ain't ringin' enough\"\nHe said \"Take two of these, put some change in my cup\"\nI said I wasn't poor, he gave me some more\nPrescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door\nOut, ouch, I'm tellin' you this all from a therapist's couch\n\"Tell me about your mother, what she's all about\"\nPrescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce\nDamn, jeez\nThe world is so cold, I'm glad I bought these skis\nWent right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees\nRendered unconscious, they rushed me to a concert\nInstead of green jello and maybe chicken soup\nThey fed me magazine covers and video shoots\n\n[Hook]\nI'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me\nIt is what it is and it's how it's gon' be\nUntil I get there\nTill I get there\nAnd yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect\nBut all the ups and downs will soon be worth it\nWhen I get there\nWhen I get there, whoa, oh\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd when I finally make it, I'ma stunt so hard\nEvil as Knievel, I'ma jump so far\nWay up in the atmosphere, I ain't comin' back\nBe a jerk to them jerks, yeah, that'll make 'em hurt\n\"Huh?\" said a young boy in the mirror\nA young version of me, so I started to tear up\nHe said \"You need to cheer up, your mind need to clear up\nYou're already here, just be yourself from here up\"\nThen he disappeared and I felt something familiar\nSomethin' I was taught, somethin' I had lost\nIf you are afraid or fear that you gon' change some\nAll you gotta do is just remember where you came from\n\n[Hook]\nI'ma keep it cool and I'ma do me\nIt is what it is and it's how it's gon' be\nUntil I get there\nTill I get there\nAnd yeah I got flaws, I know I'm not perfect\nBut all the ups and downs will soon be worth it\nWhen I get there\nWhen I get there, whoa, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/753d2e5aab56bd4374aec0b94269dfc9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
