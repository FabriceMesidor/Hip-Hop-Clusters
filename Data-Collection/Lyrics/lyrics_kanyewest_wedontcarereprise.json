It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through\nYou know, and people are human\nThey wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do\nThe other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax\nA lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in\nThe toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in\nSo, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)\nSo you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;\nYou have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job\nSo, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know\nTryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...\nThat they try to bring their kids to school...\nThat they try to make a difference.\"\n\n[Answering Machine]\n\"Next message.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd039262fbee95c9aa27b3639c26fe5f.711x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
