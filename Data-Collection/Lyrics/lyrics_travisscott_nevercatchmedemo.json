I doubt it\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nNo, no, no, no\nAll these diamonds shinin'\nAll this gold on me, all these foes on us\nHow do I dodge these zombies?\nThey want my soul from me\nKnow that I'm gone, but one thing:\nThey will never catch me\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh)\n\n[Verse 2: Travis Scott]\nNow it's snap time, disrespectful rap time\nTurn a nigga flat line\nWannabe-trill nigga, nap time (Uh)\nYou feel me?\nWe don't want that here no more\nCause we don't wanna ride\nI did it all on my own and I did it on time\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott with Tinashe]\nNo, no, no, no\nAll these diamonds shinin'\nAll this gold on me, all these foes on us\nHow do I dodge these zombies?\nThey want my soul from me\nKnow that I'm gone, but one thing:\nThey will never catch me\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off (Never catch me)\nFalling off, falling off\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh)\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
