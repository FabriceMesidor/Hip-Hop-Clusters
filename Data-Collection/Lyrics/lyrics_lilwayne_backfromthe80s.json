That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote. My favorite movie, if you wanted to know, if I ever said it, I never said it, it's Sixth Sense, so don't ask me why, I see dead people, you know what I mean, so I got the fuck away from them dead bitches", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3622689a5172c789024942436b11dce2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
