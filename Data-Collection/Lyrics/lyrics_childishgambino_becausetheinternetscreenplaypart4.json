HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nThe Boy wakes up. He's in a gown. His eyes feel heavy. The TV is on in his room. \"Golden Girls\" to be specific. One of the ladies just said something funny cause there's a lot of laughter\n\nSitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying \"don't go there\". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated. Now they're just sounds monkey descendants make when amused to cue other monkey descendants when to make the sounds at home\n\n...my eyes feel heavy\n\nA nurse comes in\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WHITE GUY NURSE: Hello Mr.[EDIT].

It's the truth. But also, they know. We're not friends. There's a mutual benefit to our relationship, but I can't trust them for shit\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0WHITE GUY NURSE: Then why save you?\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Cause their lives are far easier with me around.

JET PLANE - EVENING\nThe Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window\nHis father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories\nHe wanted to be cremated\nThe Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden\n\nSome girl named \"Hello_Pity_\" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all\nSo he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was \"fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol\". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures\nThe rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty\nThis girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The \"fuck you\" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like \"my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!\", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time\n\nINT. STRANGE OFFICE - NIGHT\nThe Boy is sitting at a desk, across from a solemn man. An urn sits on the left side of the desk\nThe man slides it over to The Boy\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SOLEMN MAN: I'm sorry for your loss\n\nSilence.
