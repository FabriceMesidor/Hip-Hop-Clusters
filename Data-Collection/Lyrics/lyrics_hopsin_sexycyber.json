We could try my place?\"\nPete's like \"Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?\nI really love you Lauren and I know you trust me\nBut it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things\"\nShe says \"That's fine, I'll see you at twelve\nUntil then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well\"\nShe takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff\nMake-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up\nNow it's about time she heads on out to Teej\nShe text messages Pete, \"Hey, I'm about to leave\"\nAnd she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats\nThat she almost left her house without her keys, geez\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet\nShould she go in without him, she hasn't decided\nShe doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it\nSo she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids\nIt's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite\nShe decides to go inside without him and have a bite\nThen her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it\nPete says \"Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it\"\nLauren says \"Why? What happened? What is it?\"\nThen Pete says \"I just heard my grandmother's real sick\nAnd I have to go and give her a visit\"\nThen Lauren says \"It's okay baby, go handle your business\"\nShe loves him too much so it didn't really bother her\nShe hops in the car, pulls off, somebody follows her\nBut she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud\nAnd she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album\nNow she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out\nSoon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down\nShe drops her keys, the man picks 'em up\nThen drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck\nHe slapped her, then put tape on her mouth\nTo take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud\nHe's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick\nThen he yells out \"Bitch, Pete never existed!\"\nHer heads spinning, then she just faints\nThe man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped\nFrom that day on nobody ever heard from her\n'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her\nHe tossed her body in a off-road ditch\nHe said to her \"see you at the crossroad, bitch\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nCyber, cyber\n\n[Chorus]\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl\nCyber, sexy cyber\nSexy cyber, I love her\nSexy cyber, sexy cyber\nShe's my sexy cyber girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb33e7a89a5050dc08095e21c220cc15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
