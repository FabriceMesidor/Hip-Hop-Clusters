Walker made the straightening comb;\nBut you won't know this is you weren't shown\nThe point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh\nCause we're just walkin' around brainwashed\nSo what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man\nWe need the 89 school system\nOne that caters to a Black return because\nYou must learn\n\n[Hook]\n\n\"Alkebulan\" is the original name\nOf Africa, now stripped of it's fame\nIt's good to know that in ancient times\nEgyptians developed all sciences of the mind\nTo the point where they ruled the planet\nBut Rome, Greece, and Persia wasn't havin' it\nThey attacked, and won the war\nBut it wasn't enough, they had to get to the core\nCause in that time it was Alkebulan\nThat ruled religion, politics, and man\nIn order to destroy the Egyptian race\nThey had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet\nSo they proceeded to ban it\nThen replace it with Christianity\nAnd it's, been that way, all the way to today\nLearn what we teach; hear what we say\nBut here comes the K-the-R-the-S-the-O-the-N-the-E\nThe BDP and we rhyme intelligently\nLet me continue with Theodosyius\nA Greek ruler not known to most of us\nHe, in the fourth century A.D.,\nCalls the Egyptians fools you see\nTwo years later, Justinian rules\nSix A.D., was it for schools\nAs a result, ignorance had swirled\nOver Christian Europe and Greco-Roman worlds\nThis went on for a thousand years\nOf ignorance, stupidity, and tears\nNow comes the seventeenth century hardness\nEurope, began to come out of it's darkness\nSo Johann F. Blumenbach, a German\nCame out of nowhere and started confirming\nWhite supremacy and men of colors\nBefore this time, all men were brothers\nIt was Johann, who went on to say\nThere are five different colors in the world today\nThat's caucasian, malayan, and mongolian\nAmerican-Indian, and ethiopian\nYet, the ignorance gets scarier\nHe believed whites were superior\nAccording to his idiotic fountain\nThe purest whites were from the Caucas mountains\nJ. A. Blofener, and H. S. Chamberlain\nBoth supported this outrageous racism\nThis went on to what the master race should be\nAnd why they killed the Jews in Germany\nHere is the reason why I'm so concerned\nBecause you, must, learn!!!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50c0b1be30bf41d8a7d5c0fb1cdcfd6a.350x350x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
