Shot up the movie theaters?\nTimes Square '88, whose crew was in it?\n(Photographed was?) sittin' on wood wicker chairs\n40oz in the lap, givin' off wicked stares\nPunch out kings, bustin' pistols in the air\nHangin' out a Cutlass Supreme window like \"Bitch, come here\"\nGirls cussing back at us with the fattest asses\nLike, \"Who you calling bitch?! Little black bastards!\"\nWe had to wave the flag, here come they baby dad\nDrug dealers in the crazy Jag looking crazy mad\nThey all thought they was sparkle, fucking killer men\nBut we was all Black seeds as Fred Williamson\nIt was so simple, now I'm reflecting in this gold Enzo\nFace it, my favorite trinket was that Teddy Riley guy bracelet\nSo now it's fly shit I'm draped in, customized shit I'm makin'\n\n[Repeat Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f5d18a63c2183358f999befe39d7497b.478x478x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
