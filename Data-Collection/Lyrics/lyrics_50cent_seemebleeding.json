They wanna see me bleeding\n\nHow did I get in here, life is a livin hell\nThe walls are closing in it feels Like im trapt in prision cell\nThey pray for me to fail\nBut in my face they wish me well\nBut still I persevere\nDeal with hand I was dealt\nThey neva gave me nothing every thing I got myself\nSo they can't tell me nothing Still they all in my grill\nTry to claim that they real\nTry to tell me they love me\nBut noone was ever there\nThey wanna see me bleeding\nI never been scared\nThere ain't nothing I fear\nLook in my eyes and u can see the soul of a man\nThey just dont understand\nI walk with my gun in my hand I bust up in the air\nGive niggas a runnin chance\nA soldier in the trinchez A wreisel in the fire\nSee im that young nigga OG's hate to admire\nIts the hate that inspires\nMy love for getting rich and im'a die tryin\n\nThey wanna see me Bleeding\nWhen Times get harder\nI Grind harder From the Bottom souls of my feet\nThey wanna see me Bleeding\nMy Blood's always thicker than water\nEven tho,the waters run deep\nThey wanna see me bleeding\nThrough tha Pain,i just grit my teeth\nThrough the flames I just take on the heat\nThrough my vains runs the heart of the street\nAin't nothing changed I\u2019m a stay on my G`s\nSo what they want from me? They wanna see me bleeding\n\nMan im ready to ride\nWhy they want me to die\nThey wanna live my life\nI can see the hate in they eyes\nSomebody tell me why\nWhen I look in the sky\nHe dont ever look down\nI guess that he dont hear my cries\nPlease show me a sign\nThat I got enough time\nTo get outta the grind\nA gettin in the shine\nI\u2019m tryn to hold it down\nBut I ain't worried man,what goes around comes around\nThey wanna see me Bleeding\nMy backs against the wall\nNiggas is all talk come on talk no bite niggas is all bark\nIm the light in the dark\nI ignite like a spark\nThe pimpin in me will never die Preach what mama told ya\nGo an get what u want and remember the south cause u never know where u goin if You dont know where ur from\nSo I lifted the trunk and chunked the deuce sideways break them boys off\n\nThey wanna see me Bleeding\nWhen Times get harder\nI Grind harder From the Bottom souls of my feet\nThey wanna see me Bleeding\nMy Blood's always thicker than water\nEven tho,the waters run deep\nThey wanna see me bleeding\nThrough tha Pain,i just grit my teeth\nThrough the flames I just take on the heat\nThrough my vains runs the heart of the street\nAin't nothing changed I\u2019ma stay on my G`s\nSo what they want from me?
