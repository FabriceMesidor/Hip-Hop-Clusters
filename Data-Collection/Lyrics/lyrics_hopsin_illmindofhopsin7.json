I\u2019ll just expose the truth\nI'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you\nBut who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof\nAnd I\u2019m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I supposed to do?!\nThere\u2019s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions\nBeggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen\nI can\u2019t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted\nThese ain\u2019t wicked decisions, I got different intentions\nI've been itchin' to get it, I\u2019ve been given assistance\nBut the whole fuckin' system is twisted\nNow I\u2019m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian\nAnd I\u2019ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction\nBut I can\u2019t buy it, it\u2019s just too hard to stand beside it\nI need an answer, and humans can\u2019t provide it\nI look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it\nIt\u2019s truly mind-blowin', I can\u2019t deny it\nIs Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?\nWhere\u2019s the Holy Ghost at? How long\u2019s it take a man to find it?\nMy mind\u2019s a nonstop tape playin' and I can\u2019t rewind it\nYou gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!\nI\u2019m frustrated and you provoked it\nI\u2019m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it\nI have a fuckin' brain, you should know it\nYou gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment\nIt was a mission that I had to abort\n'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source\nIt\u2019s gon\u2019 be hard to put me back on the course\nNext Jehovah\u2019s Witness to come on my porch\nI swear I\u2019m slammin\u2019 the door\nA lot of folks believe it though, but I\u2019m not surprised\nHumans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac\u2019s alive\nI ain\u2019t tryin' to take your legacy and torch it down\nI\u2019m just sayin', I ain\u2019t heard shit from the horse\u2019s mouth\nJust sheep always tellin' stories of older guys\nWho were notarized by you when you finally vocalized\nNow I\u2019m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes\nAnd somehow let the Holy Ghost arise?\nSounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!\nShow yourself, and then boom, it's done\nEvery rumor\u2019s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you\u2019re the One\nI\u2019ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun\nAnd all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge\nI\u2019ll donate to a charity that could use the funds\nFuck the club; instead of bitches, I\u2019d hang with a group of nuns\nAnd everyone I ran into would know what I came to do\nI wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you\nI hate the fact that I have to believe\nYou haven\u2019t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve\nAnd I ain\u2019t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees\nWith an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me\nI don\u2019t know if you do or don\u2019t exist\nIt's drivin' me crazy, send your condolences\nThis is me reachin' to you, so don\u2019t forget\nIf Hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it\nI\u2019ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit\nMy gut feelin' says it\u2019s all fake\nI hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith\nThis isn\u2019t a small phase, my perspective\u2019s all changed\nMy thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day\nAnd in my mind I make perfect sense\nIf you aren\u2019t real, then all my prayers aren\u2019t worth a cent\nThat would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is\nAnd I could sit in church and say \u201cfuck\u201d in the services\nMan, what if Jesus was a facade?\nThen that would mean the government\u2019s God\nI feel like they\u2019ve been brainwashin' us with a lot\nSo much that we don\u2019t even notice that we\u2019re stuck in a box\nMan, everything is \u201cwhat if?\u201d \u2014 why is it always \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nPlanet Earth \u201cwhat if?\u201d, the Universe \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nMy sacrifice \u201cwhat if?!\u201d, my afterlife \u201cwhat if?!\u201d\nEvery fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect\nI\u2019m fuckin' done! I\u2019m fuckin' done!\nThis is my fuckin' life and I\u2019m livin' it, I\u2019m havin' fun\nIf you really care for me\nProve that I need to live carefully!\nBut I\u2019ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside\nFor an afterlife that isn\u2019t even guaranteed\nWe are you, and you\u2019re us \u2014 stop playin' games!\nMy life\u2019s all I got, and Heaven is all in my brain\nAnd when I feel I'm in Hell, my ideas are what get me through pain\nDo as you please, and I\u2019ll just do me\nI\u2019m a human, I\u2019ll stay in my lane; Ill mind\n\n[Hook]\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power\nIt's us, find power\nLive life, mind power", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/07e4fcc91215270d9360cf774cb946f5.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
