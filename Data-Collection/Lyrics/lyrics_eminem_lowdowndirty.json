It's self-inflicted\nDoctor slapped my momma, \"Bitch, you got a sick kid\"\nArrested, molested myself and got convicted\nWearing visors, sunglasses and disguises\n'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis\nI'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful\nHearing voices in my head while these whispers echo\n(Murder-murder, redrum)\nBrain size of a bread crumb\nWhich drug will I end up dead from?\nInebriated 'til my stress is alleviated\n\"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?\"\nIlliterate, illegitimate shit spitter\nBitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder\nJumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her\nUsed to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler\nSmoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler\nSniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler\nY'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?\nBring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\n[Verse 2]\nI lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons\nWith a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds\nNothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits\nDoing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets\nWhere's the weed, I wanna tamper with it\nI'ma let your grandpa hit it\nLace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it\nFuck it, maybe I'm a bum\nBut I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum\nSo what I'm on is way beyond the rum\nOr any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage\nWent up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich\nWalking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich\nDandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch\nYou just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast\nGot shit popping off like bottle cap tips\nGet your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips\nSlap dips, support domestic violence\nBeat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence\nI'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?\nIf all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling\nBlitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England\nI'm out the game, put the second string in\nThis Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)\nDelinquent, choking microphones with broken English\nMake your mama be like \"Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?\"\n\"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it\nIt's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit\"\nIt was predicted by a medic, I'd grow\nTo be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic\nPathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing\nPanicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin\nFrozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue\nI think I'm dying, God is that you?\nSomebody help me, before I OD on an LP\nTake me to ER ASAP for an IV\nMotherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop\nThey say that's where it lives\nThe closest they gon' come is 2Pac\nIt's politics, it's all a fix\nSet up for these white blue-collared hicks\nIt's to make a dollar off of black music\nWith a subliminal ball of tricks\nFor those who kiss ass and swallow dicks\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed\"\n\"Low down dirty even\" I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nAnd ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\n\n[Produced by Da Brigade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/672f82b07e927570becdf0e67c91fc5e.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
