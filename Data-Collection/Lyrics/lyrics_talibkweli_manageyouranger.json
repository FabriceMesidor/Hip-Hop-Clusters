It's Anger Management y'all\nYou see, the tour ain't comin' to Brooklyn\nSo it's my job to bring Brooklyn to the tour. Yeah\n\n[Verse One]\nWe're gon' show you how to manage your anger\nBefore you do damage to a neighbor or a stranger with the banger banger\nMayday mayday, danger danger\nA lot of these rappers in the closet like wire hangers\nIt's '05, summertime, gettin' scarier and scarier\nDrug dealer's business still control America\nThe block to the boardroom, a tomb to the courtroom\nWe find dope, we smoke, we shoot and snort too\nFiends, come for more coke like free refills\nAround the way, they move enough white to make ski hills\nWhiter than the cast of One Tree Hill, we ill\nWe got angels in Heaven all jealous of our free will\nLook at 'em, they ain't got no respect for what He created\nThey live life, get to go to paradise and don't appreciate it\nBut they don't know this life is Hell on Earth\nFor what it's worth, it ain't about the ideas but who ? (Clinton Sparks)\nSome will rap between a rock and a hard place\nTorn between spirituality and the lifestyles to partake in\nTrust, my adrenaline rush like a car chase\nFlames bust out the neck when I'm speedin' up my heart rate\nTryin' to find a dark place for me to pull my songs out of\nInspiration based on things I ain't proud of\nI could rap about faith and repentance\nBut then it's me shoutin' out, \"Message\" like I'm Keenen in Don't Be A Menace\n\"Ain't don't nobody wanna heart that shit.\"\nSo said the pussy nigga at the label who be scared to go near that shit\nBut it's cool\nI don't depend on them to make me a star\nAnd they scared cause what I spit will expose a fake nigga's heart\nNow here's a bar {crashing noise}\nLet me tell you what's gangsta\nWhen you doin' God's work cause it needs to be done, not for the thank yous\nLet me tell you what's thugged out\nWhen you show niggas how to get paid without goin' the drug route\nLet me tell you what's hard\nBreakin' the cycle that got our sons and brothers fillin' up the prison yards\nLet me tell you what's real\nWhen niggas say what they feel\nAnd that'll eliminate most of these niggas with the record deals\nI hurt your feelings, it took longer than you expect to heal\nThe beef is fake, imagine how soldiers in the desert feel\nI'm like a veteran with special skill\nComin' from the home of the original gunn clapperz like Tek & Steele\nCut shit out, ? feel\nSpit so hot that the flesh will peel\n\n[Outro] [Talib talking]\nHaha.
