My grammar\nWith stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day\nAnd crack the back of that DJ\nI'm strappin and attackin a pack\nAnd whatever happens after that just happens, FACT\nFlamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy\nFocus on the syllable formats and the cash G\nG for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill\nOdd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills\nWe built and killed style and skill\nWhile poetically recriminate you like a child I will\nGet ill, and switch to earn\nCause I prefer to slur but not blur\nBlurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it\nBe seated I'm undefeated dem not see it\nObserve me then beat it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's get back to the point quickly, get with me\nThe voice from New York City is too witty\nI come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter\nFake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me\nNowhere, that I ain't been to\nYou can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through\nDisrespect the teacher I gots to get you\n*cause they can't MC*\nBut what you really sayin\nYou sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying\n\"Yo Kris you hit too hard\" stop playing!\nSwitching and swaying\nDay in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out\nBefore you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out\nThe last thing you heard is \"Who let the K out?\"\nNo grey area\nEverything is black and white we took the gray out its scarier\nEither you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience\nBut lyrically there ain't no stoppin\nI'm droppin a lot in your noggin\nCause I know that you're lyrically starvin\nCarbon, your name, battle battle\nEverybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE\nWho knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure\nI feel for ya soldier\nI hate to say it but I told ya so\nYou know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One\nIs the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo\nYou want a fresh style let me show you slow\nYour blow, I'm not your foe\nBattling me? No no no no no no NO!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Mad Lion: Outro]\nIf a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!\nBDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue\nGeneral Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah\nRepresent the hardest crew, you know how we do\nAnything tess, dead! Gun shot to dem head\nGwan *echoes*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78316fa7efcf948425107910e5b3a92b.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
