I guess it's for Nas to Ether him\nY'all awaiting an MC burial\nThis is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio\nWhat does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual\nExtreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world\nMan that is righteous, faithful and keeps law\nWill surely live declares the sovereign Lord\nAnd you are none of the above\nSee, you a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love\nAnd ya wanna know why I don't gotta answer niggas\n'Cause I truly understand these niggas\nScared of me so they talk about family members\nLike I can't point out your grandma to niggas\nDamn, you was my man like crew, dog\nDon't make me change your body frame to blue fog\nThe Q is the borough of true dons\nAny disrespect, nigga, we choose arms\nWill it be Gilmore or Crowes?\nNigga act like ya know\nYeah\n\nYa betta take it slow\nMotherfuckers act like ya know\nMess around and body ya self\nDon't body ya self", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8024cdd6806066555424f236d22aa443.641x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
