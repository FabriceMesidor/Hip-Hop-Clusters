What they call you?\n- Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy or Byron Dean\n- Yeah, I've been feeling that really JD swag lately\n\n[Verse: A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg)]\nLord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece\nBust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Alright!)\nUh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas\nI'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads\nThey all surrender, better call for niggas\nCome at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge\nI'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em\nI order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em\nGet a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds\nI want all you niggas dead (Yeah!)\nYou want oil nigga money, royalness, and bread\nRoyalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead (Grrr! Yeah!)\n\n[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]\nNow I'm only up again\nKick... kick a man while he's down\nLooks dead; can\u2019t be safe to say it\nEverybody's getting punished\nLooking down to sell with you, how have you been?\nProbably an undercover, had them undercovers with you\nPeople buying and selling for you\nI'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell\n\n[Outro: A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg)]\nLord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece (Booyah!)\nBust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Bop, bop, bop, alright)\nRep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef (That's right, booyah!)\nBlow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets\nJimmy Dean\n(Alright!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3054c642a320e82b70b35c53ad1cc8d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "A$AP Rocky"}
