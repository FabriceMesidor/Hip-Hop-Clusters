Nah, kidnap his mom, first\nTold you, when things get worst, nigga, things get worst\nCats be saddling, when the gats splattering\nOl' Dirt, caught one through the lower abdomen\nStraight through the back, like the javelin\nWord, son, it had to been, still here, battling\n\n[Hook 2X]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/035d8c96b903707a3cfd550d89c33684.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard"}
