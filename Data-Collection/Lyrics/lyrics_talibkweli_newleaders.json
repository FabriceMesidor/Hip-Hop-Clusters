(yeah)\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh (hey, hey)\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh (yeah)\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh (come out)\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh (uh, ay, ay)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nClap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey\nClap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nWelcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid\nThirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake\nBe the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you \"gay\"\nSuch an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say\nDon't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs\nLike spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up\nI know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck\nYou told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love?\nThere's gotta be more, some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor\nI've been through a door, I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for\nThe music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it, like it was pottery or\nThe mouth with the law, twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw\nFree as the diamond you found on the floor, I furnished the rhyme with the proper decor\nI burnished the nine in my mind with the galore, so they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door\nTo top it all off, if your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce\nThat's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all, I done forgot what I'm following for\nEnough about y'all, now back to me, ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty\nThese new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece, so when they hear me rap it's catastrophe\nCause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef\nI don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nClap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap clap clap clap for me hey\nClap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap clap clap, now bring it back\n\n[Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming (yeah), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\n\n[Verse 2: AK]\nOh lord\nEver since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen\nTo rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium\nMartin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus, though as funny as it seems it remind me of us\nThrough the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust\nDo it for the children without a ceiling to live up under\nTimes getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder\nIf all our people spreaded love instead of evil\nWe would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal\nStay true, I gave you my oath, what would the ancient God my nigga Thoth\nThrough all the books and the screens I was taught, I look at myself and pretend to learn the most\nOur leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers?\nIf you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nClap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap for me uh (put your hands together)\nClap clap clap clap\nClap clap clap, now bring it back\n\n[Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (catch up)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming (wake up), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah, catch up)\nGot enough followers (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nGot enough followers (what), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\n\n[Verse 3: Issa Gold]\nAs I change the so called predestined course of my life\nAdvance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light\nMoving these intricate insecurities out of sight\nMoving myself forward from the darkness into the light\nI take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity\nThat plague millions of young innocent souls like me\nGave me the genius mind state necessary\nTo feast off of mother's unlimited figurative tree\nOf life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it\nSomething like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions\nAs I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism\nI wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism\nWould you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions\nIn light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision\nAnd now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)\nAnd now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up)\n\n[Chorus: Talib Kweli]\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming, catch up with us cause we leaving\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (uh)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders\nWake up cause no you're not dreaming (no), catch up with us cause we leaving (yeah)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nI'm looking for some new leaders (ay), I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\nGot enough followers, I'm looking for some new leaders (ay)\n\n[Outro: Talib Kweli]\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh\nNana-nana-nana ohohoh", "image":
