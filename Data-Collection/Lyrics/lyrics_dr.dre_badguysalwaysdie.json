It's on you\nDo you recall when you and Snoop was a group?\n(The Chronic)\nWell, all we gotta do is find a map to part two\nAnd plus I know who's got it\nWho?\nSome old dude who's got 26 plaques\nAnd he already sold two\nLoaded up my saddle, got ready for battle\nHid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel\nWe rolled two miles until we hit the spot\nAn old ghost town that everybody forgot\nA place where they used to smoke chronic a lot\nSlim grabbed the shotgun\nDre, here's the plot\nThis is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless\nHe's going around saying he took the game from us\nLet's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'\nHe ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach\nHe's got mechanical legs, he spins webs\nPlus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads\nOur mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs\nAnd we can put him on his back down a flight of steps\nI drew two guns, spun them on my fingers\nKicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'\nI could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a \"G Thang\"\nAnd a verse from \"Keep Their Heads Ringin'\"\nI said, \"It's Dre's day,\" and started to spray\nIt's 1800, he pulls a AK\nHollow tips started flyin' every which way\nThat's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge\nI fired the first shot, spun his body around\nHe hit the ground and landed upside down\nDre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold\nI grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ride like a cowboy toward the sun\nAnd life ain't fun when you're on the run\nGot your gold and you got your gun\nThe life as an outlaw just begun\nGot your shotgun by your side\nGot your horse and you got your pride\nYou ride 'til there ain't no place to hide\nIt's sad 'cause the bad guys always die\nYou ride like a cowboy toward the sun\nAnd life ain't fun when you're on the run\nGot your gold and you got your gun\nBut life as an outlaw just begun\nGot your shotgun by your side\nGot your horse and you got your pride\nYou ride 'til there ain't no place to hide\nIt's sad 'cause the bad guys always die (Always die)\n\n[Outro]\nThe Wild, ha-ha\nThe Wild West\nHa-ha, ride, ha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/67be58a5622b416a7f512d91c9ee314c.1000x979x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
