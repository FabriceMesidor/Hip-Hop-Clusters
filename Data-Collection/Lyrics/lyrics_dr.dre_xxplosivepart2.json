Everybody's jiggy now\nIs the hustle that good in\nEverybody's city now? Or do they act good?\nI pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep\nAnd when I snore it sounds like\nI'm sayin \"Wheres my money?\"\nI ain't playin, I'm out there\nLike, \"Wheres my honies?\"\nYou gotta be a pimp to understand\nJust how I'm layin\nFuck a Lex Bubble, I'm rich\nAnd after this\nI'mma be rich all over again, except double\nSee, you ain't so hard if you ain't burnin rubber\nIn somethin with numbers after the dot, you ain't no star\nMe and my whole crew, did either shot a nigga\nOr been shot, and if you chuck us out, ain't no scars\nHint: steppin to me is suicide\nAnd that basically means that you can die\nTrue superfly\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nMy lifes in the fast lane\nThats when I knew I had game\nWhen class came I had hoes\nBut didn't know they last name\nIn school, when you niggas was tradin clothes\nMe and my niggas was tradin hoes\nLike \"What they fadin fo'?\"\nCarry my books you ho\nI had 'em slavin, yo\nI get scarred then I played the ho\nLike \"Way to go\"\nControllin the halls\nHoldin a black Mack-11\nUnder the black leather\nPlatforms, a hat with a feather\nI was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi\nAll we did was throw parties\nAnd show up with Gold Gotti\nHandsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from\nCuz you could only be the man in the shit\nThat I was banned from\nMake this shit seem easy\nFiends need me\nMake the most conceited chick\nIn this bitch seem sleazy\nPleased at what I'm doin\nAnd to all yall pimp niggas\nPimp on, and I'll see yall at the reunion\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
