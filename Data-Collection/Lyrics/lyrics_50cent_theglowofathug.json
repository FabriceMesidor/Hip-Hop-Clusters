Hmm, should\ufeff I?\nGhetto as I wanna be, I say \"What up dude?\"\nWhen I breach you serve you bricks, through time to beat you\nSend you back if you headed to your people\nThrew out my chest when I make power moves like I'm right on the L\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou wanna, party with me, come on, party with me\nOh, you don't wanna party with me, it's aight with me\nShorty, what's your favorite champagne, Cristal, Moet or Dom P?\nLighten up, get a bottle boo, but it ain't on me\nI'm caught up, in my ghetto way of thinking\nFrom the ice, to the minks, to the champagne we drinking\nBig boys is playing Benzos with AMG kits and 20 inch Lorenzos\nFollow me, round and round, the club\n3 and a quarter drop-tops with hard tops\n20 whips for chip; that's it. Average joes who flip bricks\nMy team flash keys like they grow on trees\nWhen it's hot, park the whips and ride bikes\nIf you [?] through traffic on the turn-bikes, aight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3ac0369e9af7e95b4d1574832fafebfe.430x430x1.jpg"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
