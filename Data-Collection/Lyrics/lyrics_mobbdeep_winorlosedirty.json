We outlive labels, and distributors\nWe run laps around e'ry artist on your payroll\nThen hop up in a Range Rov', jet black\nWith the black rims, killin yo' bitch in her a-hole; uh-oh\nHere I go again, whether I, win or lose\nBut losin' ain't a option girl\nMy destination is top of the world, top of the world\nHere I go again, here I come, win or lose\nBut losin' ain't a option girl\nMy destination is top of the world, top of the world\nHere I go again, whether I win or lose\nHere I go again, here I come win or lose", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42d069fe8357b9423abc0b46d79ba08d.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
