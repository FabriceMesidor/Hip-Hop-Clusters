Fuck on rock or bammin' Obama\nI'mma fuckin' bomb ya. Have to be something with your mamma and Osama\nBin Laden, that nigga been hidin'. Probably been ridin' in the dirty\nEating on my dad's white stuff, like Mcflurry\nNigga's can't burn me. I am not a book, you can't learn me\nBut don't fuck me, you cannot yearn me. I am not a fucking check, you cannot earn me\nWhat the fuck else rhymes with earn? Bernie\nBernie and irk, irk and Kirk, and Kirk is fucking Berk and Berk is fucking Bobby\nBobby's fucking auntie, Johnny. Johnny fucking nanny, auntie. Johnny's fucking Chuck, and Chuck is fucking Bobby\nSo, it's like a threesome, with eighteen more fucking people\nI'm a fucking zero, your a fucking two plus eight, six. I can't count, that's why I won't amount to shit\nBut I got a big dick, and it's growing. And my fucking lyrics keep flowing\nAnd my mother fucking spit keep getting on my fucking clothes and the camera\nLens. I am in the mother fucking camera bends\nI don't make sense, but I could give a damn if your bitch is a man. If your mother fucking head hurt from working all day\nIf your momma's dead, she be sucking dick and fucking pussy blunt ashtrays with your uncle\nFuck 'em, fuck you. If you looking at this, fuck you\nHere, you is a mother fucking queer\nShout out to Odd Future, Peas 'n Carrots. We gon sit down and say cheers. I just though of that right now\nActually, I thought about that two minutes ago. We can go find a ho, or a slut, or a bitch, open up her legs and probably bust a nut in her hair\nSpit up on the lens, lens up on the spit. This camera's shit\nHopefully, some nigga's will get me a cannon\nBack to my first line, bammin Obama. Fuck you and your fucking momma\nAnd your momma's cousin, they be buzzing, they be smoking, and then they coke, and then they drink, and then they play Young dro in a Lincoln. I'm winking\nI'm lying, and your bitch is lying. Because the bitch got shot, and her fucking mom's dying\nNo, she's not dying, I'm lying. Her fucking uncle bobby just got shot with a BB......Gun, nigga's better run\nMy dick's a gun, and it's about to cum. Blow you in your mouth, yeah, I blow it in your mouth\nGet it? No, you don't. Yes, you will, no, I won't\nFuck, I'm running out of breath. Need a fucking, inhaler before I fucking, inhale ya\nThis shit is recording, now I gotta save you like I'm jesus Christ, but I'm not\nAnd hopefully the nigga behind me don't have a knife. I'm home alone, and I got my own bone, this is my own song\nActually, I'm going home tonight. Actually, I'm lying, I ain't right. Yep, yeah, eah\nNo, I'm going theres, to the house\n\n[Final verse]\nI'm from Hawthorne, the dirty dirty. Where niggas get stabbed up, where niggas get rabbed up in rasbeads\nAnd when I say rasbead, nigga's get raped. No homo, we're not fruity, we're not rasbead\nWe're the other b2k members. We're not fucking white winter, like December. We're low so, like fall in like September, or October, or November\nI thought I told you, fuck. I'm sick of fucking rapping, I'm sick of fucking clapping, for you mother fuckers that's rapping\nSaying that I freestyle, bring the pain. Nigga, this is not a freestyle. I'm not stupid, your not Lil Wayne\nThese nigga's say, fuck I'm not gonna get up into it. Because these wallet chain niggas gonna get me into it, and I'm a say screw it, but I'm not gonna chop\nBut I'm not Mike Jones, and I'm not Mike Jones, Mike Jones. Who? Shut the fuck up\nHere's a dick, dad, you can suck up. But actually, I don't give a fuck up\nI'mma a be a man about it and hopefully, suck it up. I'm talking about your dick, fuck it. You love it, no, you fucking hate it\nAnd you fucking rate it, and degrade it, and discard it. Fuck it, I'll catch you niggas tomorrow\nOdd Future. Happy Days. Bicano, and Casey Veggies.
