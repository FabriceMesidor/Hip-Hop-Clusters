She wanna be my\n\n[Chorus: LL Cool J (Richie Sambora)]\n(Baby) any time of day\nGet off the bus, girl, we running away\nSo you can be my (baby)\nLet's take a roll in the hay\nLet's go out in the yard to play\nYou wanna be my (baby)\nAll night and day\nLet's go, put the books away\nYou gon' be my (baby)\nNothing left to say\nThat'll only take my buzz away, hey, hey\n\n[LL Cool J]\nShe likes Hip-Hop and Rock & Roll\nHer lifetime goal is a movie role\nShe lookin for a man that could give her a break\nLike Usher or Justin Timberlake\nI'm really not sure if her breasts are fake\nCause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake\nWe drink some beers inside her dad's Camaro\nShe shot me in the back with cupid's arrow\nWe finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back\nPulled up her dress and she made me eat that\nI'm drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty\nTruck stop bathroom at 7:30\nOrder some dessert, muthafuck if it's early\nHead spinnin around like roller derby\nEverything about her says you dont deserve me\nI hope im worthy, for you to be my\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nIn the back of the pickup clothin ripped up\nHow about a cornfield, shit gets more real\nRunnin and laughin, music blastin\nSide of the road bent over crashing\nMouth all dry, I've been pumping herb\nIf you see my mama, dont say a word\nThe cops wanna know why my words are slurred\nDon't ask me officer ask hurr\nWanna another drink baby she like surr\nWanna hit the club she like I dont curr\nShe all in the rearview doin her hurr\nHairspray and lip gloss everywhurr\nThis all happens on an average day\nYour life is the shit, girl I'm here to stay\nI never had a girl make me feel this way\nEven though I had to pay, you gon' be my\n\n[Chorus 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
