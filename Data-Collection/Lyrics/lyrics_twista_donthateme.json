Tailors\nYou ain't one of them get higher than helium playas\nOr three tone? Gators\nYou can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us\nLame, greedy instigators\nCan't see how you mad just cause she date me\nI could never let a girl make me\nThere's plenty women out here dog so don't hate me\n\nDon't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me\nIt's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me\nI didn't even know she had a man\nShe said she didn't have a man\nShe said she didn't want a man\nSo don't hate me\n\nDon't be mad if yo' girl wants to leave with me\nIt's not my fault yo' girl is really feelin' me\nI didn't even know she had a man\nShe said she didn't have a man\nShe said she didn't want a man\nSo don't hate me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
