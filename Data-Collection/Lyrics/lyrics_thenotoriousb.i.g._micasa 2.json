Kelly]\nNew York to Chi\nPerfect combination\nKells, Biggie\n\n[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]\nYou see, I don't sweat these hoes\nI keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds\nBitches just like to play the merry-go\n[Yeah we know, drop the scenario]\nIt was me, Dee, the MPV\nThe blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-Tang\nM-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch\nDee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit\nLight the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp\nNeedless to speak, the Gee's obsolete\nDon't sleep! Banged the skins in a week\nOn the creep up the avenue\nI seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?\nThat's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee\nNow she fuckin him and fuckin me, see\n\n[Hook: R.

(Ooh wee)\nI'm not lookin to find a wife (Find a wife)\nJust someone to make a friend of mine\n\n[Hook: R. Kelly]\nMi casa, you casa (Oh)\nI ain't lookin for no wife\nI just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)\nHit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha\nDo the pussy good, I might do anything for ya\nGirl show me how to work that thing (Wo-oh)\nYou make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)\nBaby baby, can't you see?
