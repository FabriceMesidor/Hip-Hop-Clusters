No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote\nThis is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke\nRiley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike\nShe won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite\nApprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin\nMake Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes\nWrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound\nThat doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns\nThis my album, and when your parents try to come around\nDo the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down\nAnd when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud\nTell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud\nThen start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down\nBut call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour\nTell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower\nBut make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power\nThis is the shit that is makin' me cynical\nThe clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical\nFuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll\nO.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general\nSo when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal\nThe coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll\nLife is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll\n1-800-fuck-this-shit\nSeven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold\nBut when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul\nIt's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals\nOut the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol\nAnd a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime\nIn a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine\nWolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time\nThe fuck I give is the same as the next line\n\n[Outro]\n(Fuck everything) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nSo the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/610384882ca6311db99de4fbfcdf2b46.421x421x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
