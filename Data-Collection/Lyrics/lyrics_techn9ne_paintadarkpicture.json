underworld that is just as real\nBut not as brightly lit... a dark side\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI don't really give a fuck of what you think of me, I had it up to here, yep\nFollow me into another dimension of insanity's right here, step\nI know you're feelin' I'm lovin' you\nWhen I'm kissin' and fuckin' you, in a minute I'ma veer, left\nAnd by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover\nAnd then I finish when you're near death\nI'm sorry, but I mean it\n'Cause when I got to chewing on the bitch I got bulimic\nUp in her like a gynecologist, with a penis\nAnd when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish\nBad as a demon I cannot get rid of, I really rely\nOn the feeling of the sex and the red of a woman\nCan I take a bite of your cerebellum?\nI think it'll really get me up if I could be sucking your serotonin\nI'd rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trust in me\nBetter yet I just make her the suffer who taught me and mocked me and fucked with me\nMaybe get up in the club and shoot it up and make 'em panic at the disco\nKcuf uoy, fi slived era, tahw uoy pihsrow\nI can paint a dark picture\nYou don't want me to start with ya\nDon't want me comin' up with the heart, hit ya\nChew you up and if you really tart, spit ya\nAfter the brain, I put the lemon moraine in\nBlood of a dame, is what I drain my fangs in\nTakin' the spirit and then the body it came in\nAway from the sun and forever you can remain in\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away\n\n[Verse 2: The Dirtball]\nWhen I'm all up on a pallet o pain\nWith blood of my name, in vain sun up in it\nI'ma break it down the walls\nAnd try to stop me from poppin' my gun up in it\nSkits onta me honor me for the time\nNever given to the rhyme in another mind lookin' like a nice guy\nBehind the face be the beast of another motherfucker that be heard the least\nSo many hear me when I say they can\nThat I remember everybody that laid me astray, yo fuck 'em\nNobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuck 'em\nI'm to sick that I never checked outta my mental-ward working in Sweden\nBurying the bodies, this song made my memory feed 'em\nGhost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them\nI don't even wanna talk about it\nBut I do it for the demons and the devils alive\nHopin' that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time\nWhen I make a move when I'm comin' through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme\nDevoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine\nPicture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin' from a meat hook\nYo I'm bangin' on a meat hook it's the twist\nThis chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a main hook book\nI'm tellin' everybody I'm not doin' so well\nI'm feelin' my noggin to you better watch ya self\nSub-noise when I'm bangin' on a tech set\nBest believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse everything\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI'm your worst fear, I'm your favorite\nI'm your acquired taste, will you savor it?\nIf it's blood thirst, will you run from it?\nNo need 'cause I'm inside of you, when the sun is lit\nYou cannot escape me, I'm your last resort\nWhen you have an eager, you cannot report\nI am the void of sunshine, malicious, vain and heartless\nIf ever you need an alibi, rely on me, I am\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\n(Darkness) I can write a verse and take the sun away\n(Darkness) Say goodbye to light because it's gone today\n(Darkness) Ain't no smiling, happiness is done away\n(Darkness) Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away", "image":
