Drunk! Drunk!\n\nCheck it, I got the speakers going hammer\nGot heaters that'll sleep ya, whole\nFam in past tense like some week-ago pajamas\nI know my way around here just like I designed a compass\nWhen your girl come around here\nI feel like I jumped inside her trumpet!\nI got it locked like I cut my vocal sessions in the vault\nEspecially when it's dark, I get desolate with thoughts\nI'm getting green like Brian\nPumper under water with his\nWhole jewel collection on\nWrestling the Hulk\nYou should respect this like\nYour ancestor, to step up\nTo try to keep up is too much damn pressure\nI flow with God speed - I know\nYou playing catch-up\nMy checking account sound like Gilbert Godfried\nSinging a duet with Fran Drescher\nHigh notes! I go from water flow to pyro\nI'm damn near assault-proof\nAssault me and end up in the coffin speechless\nHands laying across you\nYou'd rather be running in the run of the bulls\nFeetless, wearing a Santa Claus suit\nGet it? You can't describe me\nI'm not a jolly good fellow\nBut still can't deny me.. get it?\nY'all need to be working on your murkin'!\nGot so many bodies on me they call me:\n\"Person on my person\"\nYou can throw my bitch's pussy up in the air\nAnd make sunshine\nLater with your bumper sticker punchlines\nI spark - fuck some words! - hitman\nAs soon as you up your face\nYou can call me Mark Zuckerberg\n\n24 bars!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/892233b049a8da052593a9b4030be708.988x988x1.png"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
