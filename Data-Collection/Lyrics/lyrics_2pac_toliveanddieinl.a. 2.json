Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?\nAutomatics rang free, niggas lost they way\nGang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood\nBut recognize and it's all good\nWhere the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out\nSnoop Dogg in this mothafucka burned out\nM.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn\nDogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn\nGot them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B\nThey got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me\nNeckbone, Tray, Heron, Buntry too\nBig Rock got knocked, but this one's for you\nI hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A\n\n[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]\nTo live and die in L.A., it's the place to be\nLet my angel sing\nYou've got to be there to know it\nWhen everybody wanna see\nAnd my angels go\nTo live and die in L.A., it's the place to be\nTo live and die in L.A\nYou've got to be there to know it\nWhen everybody wanna see\nLet my angel sing\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nThis go out for 92.3 and 106\nAll the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit\nMakin' my shit sells quatruple quitraple platinum\n(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)\nThis go out to all the magazines that support a nigga\nAll the real motherfuckers\n(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)\nAll the stores, the mom and pop spots\nA&R people, all y'all mothafuckers\n(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)\nL.A., \"California Love\" part mothafuckin' two\nWithout gay ass Dre\n(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)\n(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2b8d1860db20385b8f73b10bec2ad841.555x555x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
