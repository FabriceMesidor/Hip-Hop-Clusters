I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s still you\nHow can I tell if you under a spell? Did the fake you kill you?\nBetter pass the mic in the afterlife\nIf so, let me spit flows, good enough to offer to God as a sacrifice\nBorn again like I passed away, castigated for being honest\nCaught bail like a castaway, cause I feel like I\u2019m swimmin\u2019 on an island\nWhen I\u2019m gettin\u2019 introspective: that\u2019s radio silence\nWhen I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 up program directives: that\u2019s radio violence\n\n[Chorus: Amber Coffman]\nYou were the one who wants to slow me down\nI\u2019m a criminal when you\u2019re around\nWhat makes me think you would love me?\nWhat makes you want to unplug me?\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nBorn this way, woke up like this\nThe midpoint between science and religion\nIs tryna find out what the meaning of life is\nOctober 3rd, '75, my birth is a blessing\nAin\u2019t no spoken word could ever describe how the flow get better\nI live on the edge, I\u2019ll send you a postcard\nFuck a phone, I got a chip on my neck that\u2019s a close call\nTurn the lights off, see how we glow in the dark\nOr we growin\u2019 apart or tryna survive the flood like we in Noah\u2019s Ark\nWe battin\u2019 down the hatchets and we set sail\nTryna get far away from inhalin\u2019 them chemtrails\nMy intel says they makin\u2019 people out of the stem cells\nThe gun's our sunflower seed, we love to spit shells\nWhen them super soakers get let off, it don\u2019t end well\n\"I ain't know you like to get wet, dawg\", like Denzel\nThey hype it up like marketers, sparklin\u2019 like a fish scale\n'Til you chasin\u2019 a high like Captain Ahab after that big whale\nIt\u2019s criminal\n\n[Chorus: Amber Coffman]\nYou were the one who wants to slow me down\nI\u2019m a criminal when you\u2019re around\nWhat makes me think you would love me?\nWhat makes you want to unplug me?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3: Myka 9]\nBorn this way, Capricorn, L.A. on the day of January 15\nDr. King, his dream torn from a warm womb formed from the clay, existing\nShifting from the essence, uplifting in the presence, just drifting, gifting\nThrough this mortal coil, with mystic lessons from the sage\nCalifornia spoiled a blessing, blissed up, my first breath in outer space\nI kissed death in the face, no identity complex, it gets left in its place\nI\u2019m proud to say, no aborted torment to my rejection\nMiffed, dismayed and somewhat befuddled\nI struggled to hustle and come up when the blood corpuscle boils\nI'm pressin' issues, it's business that's mixed with pleasure\nIt's plizness to play and get paid during this clone war for DNA\nYou should know more about the donors confessing my doula from prenatal\nI'm off fire, water, elixir of liquor with soft or hardcore drugs in my system\nSicker desire to be delivered wisdom, pour black, white sexy texture of lovers\nLike jungle fever, wild zebras to make this fetus, brother\nThe son of my father, I want to hear my one Shawki and my daughter Aja\nLecture selections in musical meters in physics, you should explore and visit more\nExquisite shores and districts, take a breather\nBelieve in your epic eye memory, you are descendant of natural leaders\nExtended from before the Nephilim, Bethlehem, even Eden\nAnd new testaments, Heaven-sent, energy, books, messages read them\nScriptures, look at the various sizes of giants in Egyptian pictures\nStonehenge endured the mathematics of Mayans and megalithic structures\nEvidence frequencies Vedas, we're just the latest reproduction\nCreated out of pure star dust and made in his image but God is greatest!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25f545688171433c422bdbaf45bd1392.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
