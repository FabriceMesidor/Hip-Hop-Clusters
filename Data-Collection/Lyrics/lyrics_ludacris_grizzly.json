(grizzly!)\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)\nDon't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)\nIt's almost time..\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow if you gon slang then I hope you got dem pillars\nAnd if you gon bang then I hope that you a killa'\nAnd if you in the army, be the best you can be\nAnd if you down with my clique den you best be a G\nIf you wanna run track then you better be the fastest\nWanna be the champ? all opponents get they ass kicked\nIf you wanna rap then you gotta kick flows\nWanna be a real pimp then you gotta pimp hoes\nStop fakin', stop frontin', hurry get up off yo ass\nAs the clock keeps tickin' and another day pass\nWe all in competition but who really want it most?\nSo if you gonna drive fast put yo pedal to the flo\n\n[Hook]\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)\nDon't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)\nDon't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you wanna get rich you betta get up on yo grind\nAnd you better hurry up we ain't got that much time\nIf you wanna be a baller be the MVP\nAnd if you wanna be on top you should envy me\nYou wanna be the best teacher, know that you can get taught\nWanna be the best thief, you betta never get caught\nIf you fed up with the game, young playa, don't play\nBut if you gon do something better do it all the way\nStop fakin', stop frontin', hurry get up off yo ass\nAs the clock keeps tickin' and another day pass\nWe all in competition but who really want it most?\nSo if you gonna drive fast put yo pedal to the flo\n\n[Hook]\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)\nDon't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy! (dizzy!)\nDon't be a bear be a grizzly! (grizzly!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow make noise! Make noise!\nMake noise! Make noise!\nPut ya hands in the air and make noise! (make noise!)\nMake noise! Make noise!\nMake noise! Make noise!\nPut ya hands in the air and make noise! (make noise!)\nCause we some soldiers (we some soldiers)\nWe not sober (we not sober)\nN we gon party like its almost over (most over)\nCause we some soldiers (we some soldiers)\nWe not sober (we not sober)\nN we gon party like its almost over (most over)\n\n[Hook]\nThe world's spinnin' an I'm dizzy!
