I don't have control\nI need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone\n'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho\nDo I even have a soul?\nMy thoughts are so unimaginable\nMy brain just hasn't grown\nSince I climbed through my momma's vaginal\nAnd I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro\nSuck a dick and swallow a massive load!\nBitch, I can explode at any moment\nDon't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen\nYou talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption\nA raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then\nYour gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin\nNo cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up\nIt's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us\nAin't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts\nIt's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?\n\n[Hook]\nI must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe world has fucked me, it's time to get even now\nThey say I'm the one no one wants to be around\nGuess it's my deceivin' smile\nGuess it's because I been treatin' people foul\nMakin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out\nThis is how I handle all solutions\nThere's no false illusion\nFuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick\nWhere's the fire? I'm walkin' through it\nY'all ain't got the balls to do it\nI'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive\nWith my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate\nI'ma operate on my enemies\nChop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates\nI'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate\nUsually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state\nThe pain I have's everlastin'\nWon't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits\nThe hell is happenin'?\nThe condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine\nMake sure you say this shit to whoever's askin'\n\n[Hook]\nHe must be on somethin'\nLately I been actin' kinda cuckoo\nMomma said I got a screw or two loose\nI must be on somethin'\nThe doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood\nI ain't just been feelin' like I used to\nI must be on somethin'\nI been lost and ain't nobody found me\nTo be honest it ain't safe to be around me\nI must be on somethin'\nThis shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones\nFuck it, man, Lord knows\nI must be on somethin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/538c208e6d573914c37ce0417736d005.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
