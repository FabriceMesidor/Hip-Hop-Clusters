Why is water wet?\nWhy did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?\nStand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck\nIronman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable\nNoriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago\nSpine-tingle, mind boggles\nKangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough\nGive me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so\nI ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th\nBuilt with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don\n\n[Verse 2: Killah Priest]\nI judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me\nLounging between two pillars of ivory\nI'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece\nOur poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak\nI'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm\nMy eye's the visions, memory is the film\nOthers act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud\nThey act wild and couldn't budge a crowd\nNo matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit\nClutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip\nAnd throw all types of fit\nI leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips\n\n[Verse 3: RZA]\nAiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building\nNo time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children\nA hit was sent from the President to raid your residence\nBecause you had secret evidence and documents\nOn how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent\nDominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew\nThe year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu\nSix million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu\nOr the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus\nYou can see the weakness of a man right through his iris\nUnloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil\nUp boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl\nOnly plant the seed deep inside fertile soil\nFortified with essential vitamin and minerals\nUse the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow\nRolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144,000 chosen\nProtons Electrons Always Cause Explosions\n\n[Verse 4: GZA]\nThe banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet\nMoney feed good, opposites off the set\nIt ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree\nI got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed\nI'm on some tax-free shit by any means\nWhether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM\nI learned much from such swift cons who run scams\nVeterans got the game spiced like ham\nAnd from that, sons are born and guns are drawn\nClips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn\nDisciplinary action was a fraction of strength\nThat made me truncate the length one-tenth\nWoofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps\nRZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps\nScarred trying to figure who invented\nThis unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted\nNow watch me blow him out his shoes without clues\n'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70ce905afa9b4ece8c671d3ed66e1a51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
