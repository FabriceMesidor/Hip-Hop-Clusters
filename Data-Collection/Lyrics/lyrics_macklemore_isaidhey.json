Stand the hell up\n'Cause I wanna hear somebody rapping who's got it inside their cuts\nNow you can get intricate, displaying your fancy cadences\nBut if you're not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit\nI said \"Who's going to teach the kids?\"\nYou wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims\nAll the money in the world can help you look like a star\nBut money can't buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars\nAnd I like nice shit too\nBelieve me, I got a closet full of Nikes and whole bunch of Velour suits\nFitted white Tees and an Icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip-hop\nBut look beyond it when I record to these beats\nBut if I don't speak me\nWhat's the difference between my lyrics and what you hearin' on MTV\nPeople fear that if they're steering away from the mainstream\nThen their album won't sell, well, I could give a fuck\nI'm just gonna freestyle and spit what's inside my gut\nAnd if you want to you can go and label me conscious\nBut just remember there's a kid at a bus stop beatboxing\nWhose life's will be affected by what's inside of his Walkman\n\n[Hook]\nIf you got a pen and a pad put your heart down\nIf you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down\nIf you got a marker and a can bomb your art now\nIf you got a floor and you're fast kick that ill style\nIf you got a pen and a pad put your heart down\nIf you got a record and can grab lay your scratch down\nIf you got a marker and a can bomb the whole damn town\nBut if you live for Hip Hop dont ever put your hands down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
