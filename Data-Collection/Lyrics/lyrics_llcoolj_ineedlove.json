{"songs": [{"title": "I Need Love", "album": "Bigger and Deffer", "year": "1987-07-22", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall\nAnd in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call\nTelling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove\nFor the first time in my life, I see I need love\nThere I was giggling about the games\nThat I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names\nThen the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn\nAs I said to myself, \"look what you've done to her\"\nI can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels\nAll I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal\nPlaying make-believe pretending that I'm true\nHolding in my laugh as I say that I love you\nSaying amor kissing you on the ear\nWhispering, \"I love you and I'll always be here\"\nAlthough I often reminsce I can't believe that I found\nA desire for true love floating around\nInside my soul because my soul is cold\nOne half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old\nBut the other half needs affection and joy\nAnd the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 2]\nRomance, sheer delight, how sweet?\nI gotta find me a girl to make my life complete\nYou can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle\nI'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle\nI'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat\nKiss you on the cheek and say, \"ooh girl, you're so sweet\"\nIt's deja vu whenever I'm with you\nI could go on forever telling you what I do\nBut where you at? You're neither here or there\nI swear I can't find you anywhere\nDamn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug\nThis love search is really making me bug\nAnd if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?\nTake the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean\nFantasies can run, but they can't hide\nAnd when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you\nSuck on you neck, caress you and rub you\nGrind, moan and never be alone\nIf you're not standing next to me you're on the phone\nCan't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad\nI've got money, but love's something I've never had\nI need your ruby red lips sweet face and all\nI love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall\nI'd watch the sunrise in your eyes\nWe're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed\nOur bodies explode in ecstasy unreal\nYou're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel\nIt's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there\nMaybe this is an experience that me and you can share\nClean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet\nI swear to you this is something I'll never forget\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Verse 4]\nSee what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer\nA playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger\nFriendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration\nThis whole experience has been such a revelation\nIt's taught me love and how to be a real man\nTo always be considerate and do all I can\nProtect you, you're my lady and you mean so much\nMy body tingles all over from the slightest touch\nOf your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time\nTill we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine\nIf I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man\nI'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands\nI can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive\nI gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive\nI'll search the whole world for that special girl\nWhen I finally find you watch our love unfurl\n\n[Hook]\nI need love\nI need love\n\n[Outro]\nGirl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall\nFantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love\nAnd if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting\nI love you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f23b49c5fcde026cf74b490f39e41892.797x768x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
