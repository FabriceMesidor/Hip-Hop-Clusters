Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Nyck Caution]\nThis ain't quiddtch but you know the snitch get caught\nThen get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk\nWhen they clip all of your Christmas thoughts\nThere's no giving when they take what you got\nPlaced in the crop circle, doc with a smock, see\nArt what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci\nWhimpering, leave that risk to your Pros\nWrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke\nI'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake\nGet me mad and I contemplate irrational mode\nDon't think about nada, strung you by your collar\nThe flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper\nI'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef\nBut toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala\nThere's arrogant cops who stay intruding\nCan't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution\nThem wack rappers who track-eluding\nCritic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence\nFaster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid\nI still kill and you can't lose it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccc6b3e099d7f0a3416209e4a5d67fd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
