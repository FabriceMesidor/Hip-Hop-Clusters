In this motherfucking, right now\nBaby Jesus And The All Star's, right now\n2Pac and The Outlawz\nGot The Luniz in this Bitch\n\n[Capital L.S talking]\nWe got to put a lock on niggas jaws, so we gonna do it like this, check it out\n\n[Verse 1: Capital L.S]\nLike lamp shades\nNow they rant and rave\nI'm raw\nPlus I got more plants to blaze\nFiends came back with thieves\nWith files Long as Stant. Isle and back to Queens\nWe strap black Mac's with beam's\nI'm tight fear\nI'm that nightmare that killed that dream\nMy gat steam crazy buzz\nI slit wit wigs, plus some bid for your baby love\nI'll play the role till I'm grey and old\nHaha\nWith your pop's on the bed roll\nNo doubt\nI'm caught out with your daughter\nSouth of the border\nColt made them Outlawz\n\n[Verse 2:  2Pac]\nCheck it out\nIs it, money and women?\nThe funny beginnings tragic ending's\nI can make a million and still not get enough of spending\nAnd since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell bound\nRather be buried than be worried, living held down\nMy game plan to be trained in\nMilitary mind of a thug lord sitting in a cemetery cryin'\nI've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus\nBalling as a youngster wondering if he see's us\nYoung black males\nCrack sales got me three strikes\nLiving in jail this is hell enemies die\nWonder when we all pass, is anybody listening\nGot my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitching\nPlease god can you understand me\nBless my family\nGuide us all before we fall into insanity\nI'm making a point to make my beat bumping raw life\nDrop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaws tight\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac]\nGo, Niggas want to get it on let's fight\nI got some niggas in my click\nThat make them motherfuckers jaws tight\nNow\nGo, Niggas want to get it on let's fight\nI got some niggas in my click\nThat make them motherfuckers jaws tight\n\n[Verse 3 : Tek]\nChi-Chi bong water bong\n'Nough weed for everyone\nEnter the class now we kill you with sound\nSee bad boy with gun, who buss jus' fi' fun\nOr black youth them move about a three ton\nSoldier from jungle never take back free shot's\nBut that ended up at when man [?] fly\n\n[Verse 4: Buckshot]\nThe impulse makes your body pulse beat off a beat per minute (Ohhhh)\nAs I get up in it\nConstruction no limit\nPin it like a cat in a dog fight\nWe gone get it on tonight\nFor all y'all who put up the wall to stall\nBut didn't realize that the weak would fall\nThe best pick out of the crop of MCs got rocked by the fact of realness\nStop, the shit, block parties was a thing of the past (Thing of the past)\nMotherfucking club hopping was suppose to last (Suppose to last)\nBut all I see\nIs niggas by the mass (By the mass)\nFuck even bitches came to kick some ass (Kick some ass)\nBut don't keep the club close that ain't my fault (What?)\nTake them back to a grain of salt (To a grain of salt)\nTake the indigence ever since BDI went solo (Oh)\nI hold my cash [?] for a dollar\n\n[Chorus 2Pac]\nLet's, go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight\nI got some niggas in my click\nThat make them motherfuckers jaws tight\nGo, Niggas want to get it on let's fight\nI got some niggas in my click\nThat make them motherfuckers jaws tight\n\n[Verse 5 : Steele]\nUp to bring them dukes up\nFuck niggas up 'till they puke up\nShoot up the party if they don't let me in\nGet my whole click to let me in\nOutlawz\n\n[Verse 6: EDI]\nI told 'em\nI told 'em\nI told 'em\nShut the fuck up\nYour voice is hurting working my last nerve\nYo that's my word I'm about to take off\nBreak off a chunk of this trick ass chump\nWho's knowing deep in his heart\nHe ain't wanting to see no funk\nWhen he drunk\nYeah that nigga done go to him\nRan through him got him thinking he can ruin\nNow he thinking I'm pursuing\nWho's in, the motherfucking house\n(Outlawz)\n'97 we put some paw's on these motherfuckers jaws\n\n[Verse 7: Numskull]\nI see the same old shit blame it on the jabber jaw's who blabber all nigga's business\nShut your mouth before I shit in it\nI got the strength to make their jaw's tight don't forget ho's I got the game to make their draw's right\nDon't go Hollywood\nThat's what they tell me\nThey bought my fucking tape but I can see that they ain't felt me\nHeard what I said they started churpin' like birdies\nDrunk off rum bumpin' gum's like girlies\nPuttin' they lip's all on my Henn' bottle\nNigga slow down put on the brakes on all that chin gobble\nSquabble squabble nigga this is Oakland Beirut\nStop opening up your jaw's thinking that this whole shit it's cute\n\n[Verse 8: Napoleon]\nBut it's this I'm hearing\nThat young Napoleon is disappearin'\nBut I cancel that shit for I reverse on this clip\nAnd leave you fucked left right something evil\nAll my life I've been trapped down by my own people\n\n[Verse 9: Kadafi]\nI'm on some shit to make your tummy's turn\nFull clip's ready to pull quick\nFuck all that bullshit I ain't concerned\nIt's evident\nI need dead president's the city slicker\nJersey jigger\nFeel my residence from we turn\n\n[Verse 10: Napoleon]\nTalk about times is hard\nCome take a trip down my boulevard\nAt your own risk\nGot niggas that's homeless\nBut'll leave you scared\n\n[Verse 11: Kadafi]\nTrapped in these bar's of crime\nDroppin' picture my nine hittin' cowards up from there feet to there spine\nIn this game all rules apply\nWith no exception's all niggas die living high\nWith no easy exits\n\n[Verse 12: Napoleon]\nLeave your body over chocking when this gat get to smoking\nAll you pussies from here to Hoboken\nLeave niggas jaws tight\n\n[Chorus till fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a1a90553105ad6af8fac203ba73284bf.480x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
