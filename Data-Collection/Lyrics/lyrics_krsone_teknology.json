Either way we gon' climb\n\nUp, up, up, up\nUp, up, up, ho\nUp, up, up, up\nUp, up\n\nI ain't finished yet, my skills ain't diminished yet\nI'm that emcee that shows you how ill it get\nOpen your eye, tell me if you feel it yet\nI hope you rely on your soul, did they steal it yet?\nWell if they didn't, to you this was written\nGet off the block before the Glock start ripping", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7124063b9019b7aa2798bff144643c27.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
