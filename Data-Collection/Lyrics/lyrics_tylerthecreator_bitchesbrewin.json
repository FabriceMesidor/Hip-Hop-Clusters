I think I'm gonna puke\nCause I can't believe I lost my virginity to you\nYeah, you was in it and I was in it too\nBut I guess I'm just gonna make this fish stew because\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nBitch shake your ass, shake it until the wet sweat\nCrawls right down the crack of your ass\nBooty meets snack, back that ass up\nUntil you come back up and lick my sack up\nI'm Tyler the Creator, hang with thrashers and skaters\nI do sound like Darth Vader\nBut that's not stoppin' me from eatin' your muffin\nI think you and your friends\nShould come with me to get your salad tossed\nCause when I make this stew\nIn your gold pot addin' extra sauce because\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nI got these bitches brewin' inside of my gold pots\nAnd there's wet pussy on my face shake that ass\nAnd don't make vibrations stop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/95006fc0c5c08dc0b6ea167151ba467a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
