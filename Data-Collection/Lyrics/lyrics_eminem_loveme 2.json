(Obie Trice adlibs)]\nI just wanna love ya\nFor the rest of my life\nI wanna hold you in the mornin'\nHold you through the night (and all the bitches say)\nI just wanna love ya\nFor the rest of my life\nI wanna hold you in the mornin'\nHold you through the night\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nMy buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name\nIf it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain\nIf I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss\n911 Porsche same color as cranberry sauce\nI ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit\nLet me find out he fuckin' 'round with Bow Wow bitch\nNiggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape\nNow shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape\nI'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these ho's\nI thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose\nI used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet\nThen the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats\nThat boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail\nThat nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell\nMy back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes\nAnd Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)\n\n[Hook]\nI just wanna love ya\nFor the rest of my life\nI wanna hold you in the mornin'\nHold you through the night (and all the bitches say)\nI just wanna love ya\nFor the rest of my life\nI wanna hold you in the mornin'\nHold you through the night\n\n[Collision: 50 Cent]\nI love the burners\nThe money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold ya\nI just wanna love ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e4a1bd93e045b909843de21d49a9bb97.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
