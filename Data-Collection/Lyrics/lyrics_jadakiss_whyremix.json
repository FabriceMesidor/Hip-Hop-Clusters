Let\u2019s go\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nRegistered voter not blood of a panther, why is the question\nWhat is the answer, got a suggestion, here's an example\nWon't we build our own airline, states, and highways?\nFly to Africa, do some trades with Zimbabwe\nWhy did Malcolm's mission die with the man?\nWhy we ain't pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan?\nWhy the merger try to exclude L.A. Reid?\nHe brought you Usher, OutKast top-selling CD's\nWhy do half America got AIDS?\nWhy do schools care about your son's braids more than they care for his grades?\nWhy they hate our white t-shirts and hats turned backwards?\nAnd why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors?\nAnd why there ain't a MC that can touch me nor budge me?\nAnd why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D?\nAnd why this record ain't sell 5 mill yet?\nJada's as real as it get put my money where my mouth is\nLet's do something bout this\n\n[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]\nWhy\nWhy they got me strugglin', why?\nAll the brothers locked behind bars\nChained up in the system going crazy\nI better leave my pistol on, why?\n\n[Verse 4: Jadakiss]\nUh, yeah, yo, by thugs I'm surrounded\nTell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded? (I don't know)\nWhy my cases ain't get thrown out?\nWhy team USA keep gettin' blown out?\nWhy the Democratic party ain't gettin' with me?\nWhy they still hangin' black bodies in Mississippi?\nYea, why did governor McGreevey get caught with a lizard?\nWhy they take away Shyne's phone calls and visits?\nWhy I been hot for 7 years?\nWhy the new M5 come with 7 gears?\nPlease tell me why y'all keep makin' that trash?\nWhy they reinstating the draft, why is it so much hatin' you have?\nAnd why sell records and keep workin'?\nWhy we go on stage with the bread with the feet workin'?\nIt's real, why when a love one die you miss them?\nWhy it took for me to make \"Why\" for y'all to listen?\n\n[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]\nWhy\nWhy they got me strugglin', why?\nAll the brothers locked behind bars\nChained up in the system going crazy\nI better leave my pistol on, why?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/34d1815281afeb502b98075367058136.453x453x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
