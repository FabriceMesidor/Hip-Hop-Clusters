'Cept try to free you\nNiggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you\nDump 'em all in the bayou, uh\nEverybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to\nThis was meant to be a haiku, huh\nBut my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two\nOh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove\nThis is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?\nLook, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you\nOh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners\nLaunderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh\nShout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church\nWhen I heard you got booked, that shit hurt\nFeel for you bro, we know the system don't work\nTake a young nigga freedom over some dirt\nYet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny\nBlack entrepreneurs, free enterprise\nThat's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap\nThat's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that\nAll these people was gon' kill me, heh\n'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me\nWelcome back Carter, smile\n\n[Outro: Gloria Carter]\nLiving in the shadow\nCan you imagine what kind of life it is to live?\nIn the shadows people see you as happy and free\nBecause that's what you want them to see\nLiving two lives, happy, but not free\nYou live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love\nThe world is changing and they say it's time to be free\nBut you live with the fear of just being me\nLiving in the shadow feels like the safe place to be\nNo harm for them, no harm for me\nBut life is short, and it's time to be free\nLove who you love, because life isn't guaranteed\nSmile", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cf5f4f88ace021acdc18cc3cefcf2f4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
