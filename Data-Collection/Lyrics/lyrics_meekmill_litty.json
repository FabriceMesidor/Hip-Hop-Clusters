shit only)\nNiggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)\nThey said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)\nGettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled\nThey don't wanna see you win (They don't!)\nThey don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)\nYou don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space\nMansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space\nTell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)\nNiggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)\nBetter get some Sig Sauer money\nRunning 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (ha!)\nWoo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money\nI'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?\n\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again\nFly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again\nAll of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again\nAll of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again\nThey don't wanna see the squad (We lit)\nThey don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)\nThey don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again\n\n[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]\nFeature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins\nNiggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems\nNiggas said they gon' rob us\nBut nigga, we comin' from welfare\nI shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?\nShould've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick\nLie on that pussy like I hit\nCan't even be a side, side bitch\nI'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5\nBroke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!\nI'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime\nRolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline\nNiggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them\nSee, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions\nI just counted up a Quentin Miller\nA \"QM,\" that's a quarter milli\nThey don't wanna see Jae drop \"6,\" fly private when he go to Philly\nFunny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me\nWhen I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it\nI promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again\nFly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again\nAll of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again\nAll of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again\nThey don't wanna see the squad (We lit)\nThey don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)\nThey don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nAll of my niggas is way up\nThese niggas is haters, I know that they haters (Suckers)\nI score your bitch like a layup (Score)\nI make a mil' like a layup (More)\nI pop a pill just to stay up (Woo)\nI sip the lean just to slow it up (Slow it up)\nI'm with my team, and we goin' up (Goin' up)\nAll of these foreigns, they know it's us (Ah!)\nWhip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it\nLike the coca when we mix the soda up (Whip it)\nPerfect timin' and we're blowin' up (Blowin' up)\nFuck it, I'ma light the Rollie up (Rollie up)\nShorty fuckin' for Chanel!\nI ain't trippin', that's a coconut (Coconut)\nPush the 'Rari 'til the motor bust\nStack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)\nLay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper\nI feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper\nI know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper\nI be spending hundred, hundred, hundred after hundred\nThey thought I was makin' this paper!\nFuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper\nShit, I might as well get married to money\nI marry Nicki, still married to money\nShe rich as Mariah, I carry the money\nAnd fuck a deposit, I bury the money (Bury them M's)\nI bag the money, it hang out my pocket, embarrassin' money\nI act like I ain't used to havin' this money, oh!\n\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nYeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again\nFly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again\nAll of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again\nAll of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again\nThey don't wanna see the squad\nThey don't wanna see the Wraith\nThey don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again\nLitty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd74651c0c076f404b493be47f954683.1000x993x1.jpg"}], "artist":
