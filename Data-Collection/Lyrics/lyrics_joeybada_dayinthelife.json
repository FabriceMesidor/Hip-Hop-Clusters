Little yute trying to figure the bigger truth\nFed up with little proof, hopped off this stoop and cocked this duece\nAdopted by the street life, Moms was juice and riches\nPops was tools he lifted, son of a gun, he put fools in ditches\nRaised well, time went on and he aged well\nAt age 12 dropped a twelve gauge and two A-12\u2019s\nWhen I blaze this L, see niggas who ain't obey the style\nSo they spray shells and tool-grade's the cells\nYou remain swell, but you can tell that life that was once difficult\nGot flipped like reciprocals\nHe retired the days in which he booted slaves and caught up in\nFusillades, and now he gets induced whenever music plays\n\n[Hook]\nBut that's just a day in the life,\nYou saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night\nGet this made in a night\nYou can say it ain't right\nBut that's just a day in the life,\nYou saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night\nGet this made in a night\nYou can say it ain't right\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt the back of my mind I'm held hostage\nIncarcerated flow, they got me locked up and blocked up my chakras\nOnly thing on my conscience is contracts and contests\nCan't burn no bridges, surready no calling back to the\nNigga I used to be when, shit was new to me\nMove indubitably, honeys always talking about they nudity\nBut stay including me to the exclusivities\nI love titties, but amor kitties\nYou know I got those vato, you know the motto for models\nTrust you gon' swallow, but mine not those bottles\nMen lie, women lie, but not no lotto\nIt's the primeval underground but nah, not no fossil\n\n[Hook]\nBut that's just a day in the life,\nYou saying it right, weak cats get dismayed in a night\nGet this made in a night\nYou can say it ain't right\n\n\n\u00a0", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ffd16641cd517c9ff09083c1aedd959.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
