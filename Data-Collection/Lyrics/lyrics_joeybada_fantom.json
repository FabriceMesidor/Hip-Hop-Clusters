I jetted quick\nNo time for a marriage, baby in a carriage\nI'm all about my cabbage, something like a rabbit\nI'm trying to feed my ear a few carats but they ain't tryin' have it\nThey rather, see me die before they see me fly\nWith diamond supply fly and the jeans blue dye\nThat's over heads like rainbows\nWe ain't no hoes, you dodo birds, 4-0 verbs, you porno nerds\nI got my own religion so fuck what your pastor sayin'\nHard shit up in your hands like you're masturbatin\nIt's the pre-ejaculation squad, we be raping ya'll, duct-taping then taping ya'll\nJust for evidence, send it to your residence\nA bunch of fucking rebelists who never learned they etiquette\nBitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f19a23d547500fb2fba75dfe154e60cb.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
