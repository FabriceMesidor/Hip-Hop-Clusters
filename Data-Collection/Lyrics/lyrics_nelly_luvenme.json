It's your son now\nAnd I picked up the mic and put the drugs down\nNow I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud\nInstead of every time I call it's to bail me out\nOh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?\nKnowin' that everything that you said would never fail me\nLike they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do\nWhen them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'\nEven payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine\nTakin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time\nUngrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs\nBut you always come through, and what do I do\nI wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers\nSold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws\nTryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused\nAnd always be there to give you whatever you want\n\n[Chorus]\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said whatever you need\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow verse two, yeah that's for you boo\nI send you props 'cause you the only one that stuck through\nWhen I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs\nWhen I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)\nOn your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's\nYou hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys\nAin't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's\nAnd for that reason girl you can ask me for anything\nNot a for real smoker but you choke with me\nNot too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me\nLivin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me\nAnd wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me\nNeed money? My boo'll go and work the avenue\nMy boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to\nThat's why I do the things I do\nAnd I will always be there to give you whatever you want\n\n[Chorus]\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said whatever you need\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm doin' this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D\nD Quick, Boo Gees and Fatty\nMy nigga Lil' Erv, Gino and Poochie\nAnd everybody over on Euclid and Labade\nYoung Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby\nRio, J.T. and Big Money\nHerky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody\nJ.E., K-Ug and Odie\nToe-Fa, M.J., and Colby\nAnd all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday\nMy Lunatic fam, Kyjuan, Murphy Lee\nCity Spud, T-Love and Big 'Li\nYellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B\nThe rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C\nAnd without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be\nAnd I will always be there to give you whatever you want\n\n[Chorus]\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, I said whatever you need\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, 'cause y'all my niggas for life you know\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, you can always smoke with me\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nUh, uh, uh, uh\n\n[Outro]\n(If you feel it pop it and lock it)\nJust like that, you know\nAnybody else I forgot, in the city\n(If you feel it pop it and lock it)\nNorth side, (If you feel me pop it and lock it)\nSouth side, all the shorties, you know who you are\nAll the BC's, you know who you are\n(Don't stop ever lovin' me)\nI ain't got to give shouts out to everybody, y'all know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7380d9314a012fbb969df4eb6d7ec650.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
