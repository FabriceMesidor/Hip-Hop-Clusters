Uh, yeah yo\nListen, I done played with the snakes in the grass\nPaid for my mistakes I made in the past\nEverybody ate when I came with the cash\nAt least I tried to ride the wave 'til it crashed\nSame wood on the gun handle is on the dash\nAll the hoods that son ran through is on smash\nThey can't identify you with a mask\nAnd the Bible'll tell you nothing is gonna last\nThe name of the game's survival\nIf you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival\nMy boo is gon' ride, you know I'm gon' ride too\nMake an M every day, I'm gon' try to - let's go\n\n[Chorus: Avery Storm]\nEvery day, something in my way, I try\nShit ain't going right, I try to see the light, I try\nOhh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em\nAnd something holding me back\nA better man, better level, better know I try\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nUh-huh, get off me\nHA-HAAAEEH!
