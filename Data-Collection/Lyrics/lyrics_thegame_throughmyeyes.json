Jakes\nAnd the Devil tried hard just to see me break\nThat's when I switch switch cars and I cross my heart\nKnowing that I'm God's Son like the belly of Nas\nI used to dream hard about being in Belly with Nas\nEven the ghetto Mozart couldn't play that part\nLike the Eli Manning's when they play that hard\nEverybody ain't a Giant but they play that card\nAnd that card is dealt and then blows are felt\n:ike a Mayweather jab that lands below the belt\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Mars]\nIf you could see straight through my eyes\nIf I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye\nIf you could take one thing with you what would it be\nOh, If you, could be, with me\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nLight a candle in the dark and lead yourself to the light\nAnd when you there blow it out so you can sleep through the night\nThe Sun rise in the morning and your future get bright\nBright as the ice in my ear it's like a movie premiere\nAnd you can be Denzel here's your Oscar tip\nIf you can memorize your lines without reading the script\nThen you can walk through the forest while you standin' still\nYou might get lucky like Forrest 20 million a film\nAnd with that, you can buy yourself a football field\nBuild a field of dreams for kids who got that skill\nMarry a legend like Jada did if you got that Will\nBut laugh now cry later if you pop that pill\nSeemed fun for a moment but it's not that real\n'Cause your life is ice cold and you got that chill\nSo tomorrow when wake and you spin that wheel\nJust remember what I told you from on top that hill\nIts real\n\n[Chorus: Mars]\nIf you could see straight through my eyes\nIf I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye\nIf you could take one thing with you what would it be\nOh, If you, could be, with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c29ee407cd2d88f01ce08743e61d3b1.614x614x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
