Yo, yo, yo\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack once again, hello it's yo' favorite mellow schizo\nThe pavement on this yellow brick road fuckin' up my mental\nMy mood just like the tempo\nHeartbeat, that instrumental\nI never lack potential, every track is essential\nEvery project is special, abundant and fundamental\nGive a fuck about hundreds as long as it's for my mental\nWith wisdom from what I've been through\nKnowledge that some can't get to\nUnderstanding that college is only out for a nickel\nWe could all be so simple, tune it to the metronome\nThis how I used to feel back on the metro home\nFresh outta class I knew these days, they wouldn't last\nJust a stepping stone I gotta pass, another story for the lap\nBut fuck it, give him glory when he crash\nHe gettin' revved up, heads up and he's coming fast\nHe paved the lane before the cash\nThey tryna swerve me out of that\nBut I don't just got speed, nigga, I handle my ass\nPedal to the gas, life is but a getaway dash\nMy mama stash guarded by my pen and pad\nI'm drawin' weapons with the raps\nYou shoot, I shoot back\u2014no questions asked\nRaise your hands for the realest cat alive\n(Cat alive, cat alive, cat alive, cat alive...)\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ + crowd-goer]\n(That's that boy, right there\u2014that's Joey Bad'!)\nThe only-child blues (Joey for the money, man\u2014yo, Joey, man!)\nThe only-child who?
