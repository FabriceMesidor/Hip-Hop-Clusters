Fuckin' up my inner Chi\nUsed to be my Ace, now you wastin' my Hennessy\nThe remedy for haters is crap tables in Vegas\nThat crack ain't gettin' it lately\nI'm stackin' that paper, baby\nMaybe I should get a maybe, or maybe I should call Baby\nMy cash money is crazy, I crashed up my Mercedes\nBought me a Ferrari, the license plates say \"Sorry\"\nThe insides safari, the paint job Amar'e\nWhen the sun hit that bitch, man\nBounce off them 24's and land on my wrist band\nYou better keep your arm on yo' bitch, man\nOr you gon' be Jamal Crawford - sixth man\nComin' off that bench man, and it's a shame man\nYo' bitch gon' make it rain up in here\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nI brush them haters off, like \"fuck outta here\"\nOpen up my garage, pull that Porsche truck outta there\nLike \"fuck outta here, I'm up outta here\"\nJump on my hog, throw on that Rough Ryder gear\nI'm a rider, yeah, I'm a roller bitch\nI might be through with Benz', like here, hold this 6\nI get money with the players, they duckin', dodgin' Feds\nFor my bread, bring the lead, cause I'm sittin' on the edge\nActin' like I don't get it, actin' like I don't hustle\nActin' like I don't Diddy, actin' like I don't Russell\nThen you wonder why I be, actin' like I don't trust you\nIf you ain't with me, then fuck you, next time I see you, I cut you\nHow mad was you? Cause last time I felt the negative energy\nNigga, I could have snuffed you\nBye hater, cause I'm feelin' like Jada\nWe. Gon'. Make. It\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Mysonne & Pharrell]\nHow many cars we got nigga? (Thousands)\nHow many cribs we got nigga? (Thousands)\nHow many hoes we got nigga? (Thousands)\nHow many times we told y'all? (Thousands)\nHow many goons we got nigga? (Thousands)\nHow many guns we got nigga? (Thousands)\nHow many haters we got nigga? (Thousands)\nDamn... It must be tough\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6b76fdc2635fdc0e9d62ceb9907eb3c.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
