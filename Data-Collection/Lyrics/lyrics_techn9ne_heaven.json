And the reason why I chose this song is because I was blessed to have my good friend Roger Troutman on this song before he passed. So, I therefore, without witnesses, baptize myself in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and in the name of Jesus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/365df4b783df60dc1a28c15c531795e6.1000x978x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
