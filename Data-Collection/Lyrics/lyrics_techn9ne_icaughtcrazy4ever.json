It hurts (What?) It irks\nFlyin' but I'm sickened\n'Cause the crazy things I'm thinkin'\nGot you sleepin' in a hearse\nMy brain is cursed\nClosed in this hell but my soul isn't stale\nIsn't failed, so sinister, got a ghost in the shell\nWhy did it fit so perfect when I was young?\nI didn't cry when it hit me like\n\n[Chorus]\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\nI caught crazy\nAnd I plan on keepin' that shit\nForever, and ever, and ever, and ever\nInside of me I do believe this sits (Forever)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you ain't some type of crazy, you ain't shit (Facts)\nYou keep the fake in front then push the real shit to the back\nThe point I'm tryna make is if you're fakin' that is so shady\nBut my crazy 'gainst yo' crazy?
