I know it well, those nightmares ate my souls core\nAnd his music was my only drive to make it through\nNo chauffeur\nWhat I show for it? career stuck on the bench?\nOr Forrest Go for it!\nCause when life get hot or too cold to bear it\nWhat is yo porridge?\nWhat is yo orbit? did you plan it? can you manage?\nDo you hold storage?\nWill you vanish, watching son rise? screaming Oh GOD!\nLike you know Horus?\nIt's crazy!, these fantasizing rhymers don\u2019t amaze me\nThey chained my family tree\nBut see my ROOTS don\u2019t show my slavery\nAnd I\u2019m aging, grave shifting seeing B.I.G. and Pac ghost daily\nWhile I'm hoping that they\u2019ll save me\nCause society must hate me\nScared of my conscience, all my happy thoughts are monsters!\nI thought I had a trophy wife, she canned me with an oscar\nI\u2019m stuck here out my noodle, no linguine, lack of posture\nIf you think you know a sicker soul, my pen a seal them options", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea417a62cc4e48aba86c9d2a626c952d.406x373x1.png"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
