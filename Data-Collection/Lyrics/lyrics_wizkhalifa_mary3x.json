So people expect that from you\nSo it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level\nLike the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level\nThe way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit\nTakes it next level production-wise\nAnd then you take it, next level\n\nI'm glad you fuck with it\nAnd that's what it's all about\nTaking it to the next level\nElaborating on what we've done\nBecause a lot of people\nThey've elaborated on what we've done", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb8d494673bce7114840441aba72863c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
