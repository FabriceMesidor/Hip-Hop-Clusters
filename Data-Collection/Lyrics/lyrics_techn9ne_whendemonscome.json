(hide, hide, hide)\n\n[Hook: Tyler Lyon]\nWhen the darkness grabs your hand\nLead you into the sand\nIt'll take you down its blackened hallways\nPlease don't be afraid\nCome and speak my name\nAnd I will take your pain like always", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/T9EPTHRPY_500.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
