I let the beat commence\nSo I can beat the sense in your elite defense\nI got some meat to mince\nA crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse\nI greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans\nI foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans\nMy coiled hands around this microphone are lethal\nOne thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people\nMC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium\nBattle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one\nImitator, intimidator, stimulator\nSimulator of data eliminator\nThere's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus\nFuck around and catch all the venereal diseases\nMy thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces\nMy a cappella releases classic masterpieces\nThrough telekinesis, it eases you mentally\nGently, sentimentally, instrumentally\nWith entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite\n\n[Hook]\nI'm Infinite; you heard of Hell\nWell, I was sent from it\nI went to it, serving a sentence\nFor murdering instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat, I'm tempted\nTo make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan, I got evidence, I'm never dense\nAnd I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant\nTo do some shit that represents the MO\nSo I'm assuming all responsibility\n\u2018Cause there's a monster will in me\nThat always wants to kill MCs\nMic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler\nHere to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler\nNo one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical\nI get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school\nI never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical\nI'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy\nIn fact, I can't see, or can't imagine\nA man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'\nSo this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo\nOn my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B\nBe all you can be, \u2018cause once you make an instant hit\nI'm tensed a bit, and tempted\nWhen I see the sins my friends commit\n\n[Hook]\nI'm Infinite; you heard of Hell\nWell, I was sent from it\nI went to it, serving a sentence\nFor murdering instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat, I'm tempted\nTo make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite\n\n[Outro]\n'95, '96 ('96)\nAnd on and on and on (and on and on)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/796d0881ff1f81b747f2cc1f9df0f077.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
