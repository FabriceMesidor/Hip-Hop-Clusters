Yeah\n\nHere we go y'all, that's the nigga head dog\nLunatic smokin loops, loose in your sector\nGot my eye on em, on the apparatus\nLike a bone to a dog, yea you know I gotta have it\nAnywhere you get it shit, and I'mma grab it\nTurn around stares to your face and I jab it\nDrop you, like one of those ill bad habits\nHunt you, like a hillbilly huntin a rabbit\nCuttin niggas up like Muggs on the wheels\nFor reals, penetentiary steel\nPull heads to bed from the choke of a headlock\nFadin baldheads to perms, even dreadlocks\nBWOY, rudebwoy with me style\nI can get foul or wild, or just cool for a while\n\nChorus: B-Real, Sen Dog\n\n(Checkmate fool!) Hang em high\nGot the live shit, bang em whenever you/he wanna try\nShoot to thrill, be at the Hill, I/we take em all\n(Checkmate fool!) Wherever the pawns fall\n\n* repeat 2X *\n\n[B-Real]\nLook look punk, every way you get shook\nTo the pawn, takin out the rook, off of the book\nLights get tooken, taken you for Satan\nYou can't breathe, no need to look up and see me\nThe last hope, when you mellow you call whoever\nFor the hype shit, you call the Hill, put it together\nRunnin this game, bringin the same, raw shit\nOver the hills, through the city we come equipped\nTo the letter, keepin your temperature down low\nWhat I reveal, the good shit to heal all souls\nMakin you roll late night, you trippin, my game's tight\nTo the new shit I bring, never the same hype\nSo PUSH THAT SHIT OFF, get up, don't let off\nNo matter how much blood you spit up\nYou could never be, fuckin with Greenthumb\nThe outcome's specific, you spliff it, collapsed lung\nWe hit hard, breakin your guard, you can't tell\nWhen the bells ring, bustin your shell, the pawn fell\n\nChorus\n\n(Peek-a-Boo, you fuck you!)\n\n[Sen Dog]\nI'mma freak that funk yea slam it in the trunk\nI'mma kill all junk with the suicide clunk\nAin't nobody came my way, talkin bout\nThe Westside of L.A., so whatever\nPunk-ass click you claim, you keep bumpin that shit\nAnd elevate your frame, cause I want that\nBig-time, asshole, studio gangsta\nWorth a lot of shit, but that's not the main factor\n\n[B-Real]\nMy nigga Sen's rollin again, remember when\nWe rocked shows, battlin foes, the time's been long\nStrong with the styles, you ain't hear to win\nLike blood pourin out of the pen, the ink stains\nSlim chance if it gets in your brain, the hot flash\nGot you heated with repeated attacks over the tracks\nSmack niggas up, back niggas up, hack niggas up\nJack niggas up, hangin the wack niggas up\nSnowball effect, we rollin the city limits\nCrushin the bitch-ass niggas with all the gimmicks\n\nChorus\n\n[Sen Dog]\nCheckmate fool!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f0b9d852eece67bb00fcc4712c945bb.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
