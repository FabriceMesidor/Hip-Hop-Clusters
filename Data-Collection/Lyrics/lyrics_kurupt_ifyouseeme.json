DPG\nYeah what the dealy\nYo, yo, yo, yo, LAFC\nEverything else cool, the Wu-Tang is the best\nDogg Pound's the best\n\nVerse 1: Trigga\n\nMic accurate, trade darts TL\nSlight tint DL, quick flash\nSmooth as a baby's ass\nLyrical addicts, murder mics like a savage\nAnd MO30, bullet proof tuxedos\nTransactions, C-notes for the kilos\n'Bout our money, killa bees love the honey\nPuttin' a sting, on warriors in the ring\nGet mashed out initiation face slashed out\nBlock dropper, drama action like I won an Oscar\nEye on me, feds spy on me\nIt's them cops in the choppers that play the roof\nReady to snipe, stay bulletproof\nEase up on the over proof\nLevel head the liable and leave ya for dead\nFill fulla lead\nIncidents, classified accidents\nNo evidence, po-po innocent crime pays\nI guess it's the American ways\nFar from slaves\nYet behind bars and cage\nFair exchange clicked ya bow wid ya 12-guage\n\nVerse 2: Baby S\n\nIt's time for me to do this shit for all my years hurtin'\nSee these other niggas bustin' raps that ain't workin'\nI'm jerkin' the game, heavyweight pocket exchange\nTouch my niggas that's broke and hope them niggas do the same\nPause, squeeze ya balls wid no draws\nDown for the cause and hoes takin' off they draws\nY'all, niggas, ain't knowin' the half\nEverywhere I go feel like I'm runnin' from crash\nMy intention to smash fast plex on elevators\nSacked a hell a haters crime raider on the fader\nI'm major now, women hit me on my pager\nWhile I'm puffin' on the bombay\nThe vietnam way... pimpin' in a calm way\nAnd rule one, never let a bitch know where your baby mom's stay\n\nHook:\n\nNow if you see me creepin' thorugh SC\nJust walk on by, nigga, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\n\nIf you see me in the NYC\nJust walk on by, nigga, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\n\nVerse 3: Short Khop\n\nGot the session on lockdown\nMake way for the cocked pound\nBest to give it all you got now fool\nFor this new era, new order, new terror, new torture\nRun up and extort ya\nAbort ya missions\nEscort physicians to the spot you and I met rep for combat\nWhere the bomb at, chop up on that\nNiggas I been there and done that\nCatch a contact\nBy drainin', try trainin'\nHolla when you've perfected ya aimin'\nReady for a taming\nAnd catch me at the spot wid this clown gashed up\nYa found me in his wife face down mashed up\nNo stoppin' this, I'm most poppinest\nAnything to the left of monotonous\nMister Khopadopalous\nBlockin' this hold ya down tech potent\nAny nigga second guessin' keep his face opened\n\nVerse 4: Kurupt\n\nCheck it out, got games, crackle\nClash of the titans up against the crackin'\nCome to fuck you up, stuck you up\nNiggas bust, niggas lookin' like Kurupt\nWhat the fuck you want?\nAll at you motherfucking small fry small guy\nMotherfuckin' small cat, beat wid pipes poles and bats\nBlast wid a small gat\nRun, and bust till his lungs collapse\nAnd hit the corner pocket\nBut first strip his pockets\nHe shouldn'ta got caught in the mixture\nSee I'm the type of nigga to pull out the paintbrush\nAnd the board and the paper and paint a picture\nYou shootin' and got shot\nWe shoot ya, Drex Luthor\n?Then pull pens to report to zoopers?\nI'm a 6-4 rap, 44 mag calicos and mass\nDouble bags caught cash\nWid cash on cash dub sacks new blocks\nBaby S, El Drex, Kurupt, Trigga and Short Khop\n\nHook:\n\nWhen you see me wid the DPG\nJust walk on by, nigga, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\n\nAnd if you see me in the ING\nJust walk on by, nigga, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\n\nVerse 5: El-Drex\n\nYo, yo, verbal seizures\nComing from the black Johnny Fever\nYou bought your heater turn like Tina when Ike beat her\nWe kidnapped ya girl and ain't feed her she's a heavy bleeder\nAt this point you realise that you ain't really need her\nCats that get it betta stand on they pivot\nLife is rigid from the business and pleasure, when you miss it\nOh well forget it wipe my pinkie ring when you kissed it\nCouldn't keep ya distance, so things was done deliberate\nA G-thing, this cost cash is not a free thing\nWhen we sing that's when they bring the jealousy thing\nBut that alerts me, the low and dirty wanna hurt me\nThey equal to the numbers on Robert Paris jersey\nBlood thirsty ten O.Gs in black derbys\nWe throw things, I got a arm like Testa Verdy\nIt's Drex Andretti the live lyrical compulsive\nBetta contact ya physician for over dosage\nYou lost ya focus, realise what you get\nA little bit of good shit\nAnd alot of bullshit\nNow you wounded\nSo you got exactly what you earned\nYou gon' fool wid the Drex it's like a tax return\n\nHook:\n\nWhen I'm in the 2-F-I-V-E\nJust walk on by, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\n\nIf you see me in the NYC\nJust walk on by, nigga, just walk on by\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nBefore you fuck up my high\nFuck up my high\n\n[Alot of mixed up talkin' & shoutin']\n\nAll I wanna say\nFUCK THESE NIGGAS MAN!\nYo, first of all\nAfter all this is over\nWe still all go to sleep\nAnd we still wake up in the morning\nSo give thanks to God\nCause he loves us\nFor real, for real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7652517cf446c15e882aa0bc85229b3.594x594x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kurupt"}
