hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\n\n[Verse 1]\nI want Monopoly money but I ain't even halfway there\n'Cause doin' dirt, a nigga got to take the back way there\nWhat it is, is the biz and it's dirty\nYou'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty\nPlace of business is the hallways, I've been up for four days\nOn parole with warrants that'll send me back to Rahway\nIf I get caught across Jersey state lines\nFigure this 9-8 and I been runnin' since 8-9\nSo that's like 9 years delinquent time, you speak in crime then you know\n9 years you owe, get knocked, 9 years you gonna go\nNo probation or parole more time doin' nothin'\nDay room to the yard, writin' rhymes and frontin\nCarry niggas greasy because I'm built like that\nBury niggas easy 'cause they get killed like that\nIf you ain't in it wit me then you in my way, but either or\nYou will respect mine and leave TEC-9 and leave it for dude\nThe realest you gonna feel is when you face your death\n\"Sorry, I didn't know\" nigga, don't even waste your breath\nCoppin' pleas not D why you flippin'\nNigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin'\nLettin' a nigga catch you when I got my guard down, so I keep 'em up\nNoddin' off with one eye open, I can freak it\nBut there's gonna be a time when I close 'em both\nLead poisonin', I'm a get hit with an overdose\nOver those drug things, crud things\nThink I don't know my slug stains, or blood blaze\nRaw gun playin' drama, sadness to another niggas momma\nI'mma be the the one that puts you up inside trauma\nThese are troublesome times and the crimes prevail\nAnd the dark side keep a nigga's ass in jail\nBada-boom, bada-bing, some of this and some of that\nI gots to boogie for a minute but you know I'm comin' back\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\n\n[Verse 2]\nTry to show niggas but I can only hope they see\nYou's a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3\nLayin' up like this, lips sewn shut eyes closed\nNiggas walk past the casket, damn shorty nice pose\nYou was ballin' nigga 'til your ass got balled out, called out\nBy some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out\nI bet you thought it was real funny, until it had to get cruddy\nMe walkin' off leavin' you with all this bloody\nWhat he gonna do when it's all over for real\nAnd the last thing you seein' is that steel\nA blast of light, that's what he seein' if you blast him right\nHit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight\n'Cause it's like it ain't nothin' but endin' it to a nigga\nStreet sweeper like ahhhh, sendin it to a nigga\nWhen you in the house you'll play by house rules\nTwo words you'll never hear again are house lose\nAnd that's house choose it ain't gonna be that, 'cause I can't see that\nReady to get up in this nigga's ass real good so where the weed at\nBelieve that, you ain't gon' see nothin' gettin' too familiar\nAnd I would tell you what I do but then I'd have to kill you\nAnd it ain't even worth it, I ain't gon' build nothin'\nSo I just let you go be that same nigga, still frontin'\nLaughin' and shit, like you see somethin' funny\nWhat you sayin' sounds good, but let me see somethin' money\nFor real\n(dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga, dog nigga nigga)\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it\nNow what y'all want me to do\nKeep your shit the hardest\nIt's about to go down\nNiggas is ready to start this\nWar that's for sure\nNigga come and get it\nWe ride or die, why?\n'Cause our niggas is wit it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
