(Hit it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nNewcomers, step on back and if you hid last summer\nCatch a heart-attack, cause I'm back\nI'm bad, you write rhymes made are blad\nI'm mad cause they said I wasn't bad\nNo recognition cause they said I'm from the ghetto\nCarryin' nine millimeters and stiletto's\nI guess I need a TV show to get mine\nBut I don't feel like kissin' no director's behind\nThat's too soft for L\nI'ma write a rhyme-fighter inside of the rebel \"Yell\"\nHour jack loops and dancer troops\nWatch out for the gangsta-machine-gun-loose\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNo way, huh, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast year pop rappers got awards\nAnd don't know a damn thing about a block party mic-cord\nThey see LL, they know the brothers' real\nBut the flies can tell you exactly how they feel\nWhen I come in the door it's like I'm made of dynamite\nI gotta blow up more and more\nShakin' the rafters from here on after\nPuttin' an end to all the laughter\nThere ain't no way they can win\nWith the band all in, plus the turntable spin\nStrip-searchin' competition, you can call 'em competition\nBut there ain't no competition cause I'm on a mission\nI'ma rip this game, I want the soul train families and anybody with a name\nSuperstars step aside this year\nAnd all you other little crumbs that wanna try and come near\nI'm sick and tired of political setbacks\nToo much red tape-the-box, so forget that\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no stoppin' this\nAin't no stoppin' this\nAin't no stoppin' this\nI'm comin', huh, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNuh-uh, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this, don't stop\n\n[Verse 3]\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, hah)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)\nParty people are you with me?
