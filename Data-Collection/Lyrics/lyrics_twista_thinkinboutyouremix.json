Do ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\n\n[Verse: 2 Twista]\n(Twista the Remix)\nBeautiful black woman can you accept me?\nI'm hoping you never forget me\nTouch you wrong I never let my hands let me\nFeelings for you as deep as my ancestry\nLookin' at you black as an Egyptian statue\nElegant in stature; got cha; all in my mental\nWhen I feel the energy every memory I still try and capture\nRapture. Beautiful goddess but modest and almost astonishes everybody else that I let you escape my physical\nForm and to be especially cause you were warm I was hoping that we would make a commitment that was biblical\nPivotal situation put us in critical consequences\nI feel like it was all senseless. Now my pain ,when I'm feelin' all defenseless\nCause I shoulda worked harder for you up in the trenches I'm a be Frank;\nOcean's I think about it comparison when I measure-in the depth of our love\nThey'll be nothin' above\nSadder than purple rain memory's got me cryin' like a dove\nWell do you ever think about it, or did you really forget\nI don't think I forgot an hour, What you'd use to look like stepping out the shower\nSuper sexy when you in a position of power\nSpiritual essence of what a real woman is\nLet's get in a time machine, I call it music\nHoping I can jog every memory you get subliminal takin' you back forever the way I use it\nHow I tell the DJ spin it thoughts about you are usually infinite You on my mind is always authentic\nWhen I think about you I be all up in it\n\n[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\n\nNo, I don\u2019t like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it\nGot a beach house I could sell you in Idaho\nSince you think I don\u2019t love you, I just thought you were cute\nThat\u2019s why I kiss you\nGot a fighter jet, I don\u2019t get to fly it, though\nI\u2019m lyin\u2019 down thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout you\n\n(Ooh, no, no, no)\nI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout you\n(You know, know, know)\nI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout you\nDo you think about me still?\nDo ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\n\nYes, of course\nI remember, how could I forget?\nHow you feel\nAnd though you were my first time\nA new feel\nIt won\u2019t ever get old, not in my soul\nNot in my spirit, keep it alive\nWe\u2019ll go down this road\n\u2018Til it turns from color to black and white\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)\nOr do you not think so far ahead? (Ahead)\n\u2018Cause I been thinking \u2019bout forever (Oooh, oooh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
