I popped your cherry\nHell fucking no I don't wanna get married\n'Cause can't no bitch hound me\nTalking that shit about a family\nI wants no champagne, I drink gin and juice\nBring a bag of ice and watch a ho get loose\nSpread the word, we're getting tossed tonight\nAnd please don't trip on the cellulite\nI got a fat bitch, sucking on my dick\nEvery day, homie, it's the same old shit\nDon't look stupid, ho, drop them goddamn drawers\nGet your ass in the bed and let's fuck like dogs\nOn the very first night, we fucked\nI got the pussy, I got sucked\nI couldn't wait, she asked me why\nI let the answer shoot straight in her eye, bitch\n\nHoes are like cum freaks, they suck you dry\nThey do what you say, and don't ask why\nWho said that ho ain't old enough?\nIf she could bleed, then she could fuck\nCall me \"Dirty Dog\" but your cot stank\nMotherfuckers think pimps ain't making bank\nBut the, pimp game just don't stop\nYou gotta be down to reach the top\nI tell all my homies \"Play these hoes\"\nDon't eat the pussy and pay these hoes\n'Cause some of these hoes get tore up smoking\nBitches like that you find all through Oakland\nMiniskirts and no panties on\nWhen it's time to fuck, it don't take too long\nAnd it's mandatory for hoes to simp\nCatch other hoes and bring 'em to pimps\nSo take this game and keep it for life\nNever make a ho into a housewife\nJust get a good bitch, a workaholic like Holly\nBitch so bold, she'll take a piss in the alley\nAnd make big bank, it's like the pussy is dope\nThey keep coming back until the tricks go broke\nBut if that ho jumps off the track\nAnother young bitch will bring them tricks right back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f82c145afb5d000ecf7dbe3e66f99782.1000x992x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
