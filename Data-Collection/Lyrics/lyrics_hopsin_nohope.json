I shouldn't have to explain it\nOur foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments\nSo create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it\nI'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience\nYou the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog\nBut I should not have to pay for your downfall\nChoose your faith, but still even if your day seem great\nJust know I got your fucking back either way, you already know\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nNow my own family tripping, I ain't think I would get this shit from siblings\nThe money I'm making is yours right? It's a given\nLet me tell y'all why I get a different feeling\nY'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in\nI don't recall any help or sympathies\nSince 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?\nCould have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand\nBut y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan\nFocused on yourself, and now you holding on for help\nYou were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell\nOh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal\nYou want the benefits without playing the courses on the field\nYou ain't even doing your best or trying\nDon't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying\nJust know that when your bright days going straight\nI couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me\n\n[Verse 3: Hopsin]\nMoney can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady\nSo why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it\nTo get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways\nEven taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken\nFoes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted\nAround them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships\nDon't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit\nMooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just\nNot the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em\nThat is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in\nA boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone\nSisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em\nThat's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries\nIn due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me\nI know that if my brightest days turn gray\nYou wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret\n\n[Hook: Hopsin]\nI've been there when you needed me the most\nHad your back when you were broke\nI've shown you love when there's no hope\nYou were my friend, like blood\nLike brothers, like family\nAnd I say damn\nWhere would you be without me?\nWithout me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e4079e5e3fa49647b0a22cad37ceae57.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
