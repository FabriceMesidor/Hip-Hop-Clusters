Come on\n\n[Hook: Eamon (sample)]\n(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah\n(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah\n(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah\n(All we can do is) I'mma try to (Hold on) hey\n\n[Shawn Wigs]\nI can't believe you walked out of my life\nNot saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it\nI know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat\nLet a good man go, so you can run free?\nCould of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones\nYou left me when my music was down with no fun\nBroke, I struggled so you made it through college\nCuz I had street smarts, but you had knowledge\nLongevity, suppose to be together forever\nNow you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever\nSo I'mma open the cage and set my butterfly free\nJust hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me\n\n[Hook w/ Eamon ad-libs]\n\n[Eamon]\nBut I'mma try to, hold on, and be strong\nCuz this time, you're so wrong\nBut I wait, and, I long\nFor you touch, but you're gone\nAll these tears, and all this pain\nI'll never, never, feel the same\nI keep control, I lift my soul\nI sing my song, I hold on\n\n[Hook 2X w/ Eamon ad-libs]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c666c55fe38ac486d5bf42862246cf28.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
