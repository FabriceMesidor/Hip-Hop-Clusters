Hey\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]\nUh, I know you used to watch me\nRock Gucci and Versace\nBut now I'm back to my skater roots\nI still got friends in them gator boots\nBut what's up with them hater dudes?\nMa, hating is okay with you?\nWhy? Cause they drive in them fancy cars?\nLook, well I can ride you on my handle bars\nOn my BMX, baby\nI'm creative with Tourette's baby\nMy testicles full of ecstasy\nWhen I think about you naked, please\n\n[Hook: Erykah Badu & Pharrell, Common, Pharrell & Erykah Badu]\nCome close to me\nCome close baby, come close ma\nBaby (baby)\nLet me hold you love, come closer love (baby)\nI know this world gets\nIt gets crazy baby, it gets crazy girl (crazy) (but)\nWhat's it without you, you, you, you?
