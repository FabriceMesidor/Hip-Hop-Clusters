I can see it right around the corner\nBut you keep sayin' that you bout to bounce, it's fuckin' with me\nBut then you say you love\n\n[Chorus]\nSee here's the thing\nEvery time I go and turn back around\nPullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down\nIt doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'\nSo let's go do it now or never\nCause I been thinking bout forever\nYou're everything, see that's the thing\nSee that's the thing\n\nYeah\nI love to love you, hate to love you, girl you get me vex\nWe argue and then we have that good make up sex\nWe argue and then we have that good angry sex\nSome say the arguments make the sex ex'-\n-Traordinary, not your ordinary climax\nWant me grab you by your neck, call you a dirty bitch\nWhile you call me all type of wild shit\nPullin' on my chain like a jockey while you ride\nYou bettin' that I'm first to cross that finish line\nI ask if you stupid, you ask if I'm senile\nYou gettin' me more charged so I start to freestyle\nHittin' you sideways, girl we gonna be a while\nFlip you upside, I got you downside up\nDoin' squats in your box while you watch every thrust\nAnd I, take it easy on you long, slow, strokes\nHow could you not want more, girl tell the truth\n\n[Chorus]\nSee here's the thing\nEvery time I go and turn back around\nPullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down\nIt doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'\nSo let's go do it now or never\nCause I been thinking bout forever\nYou're everything, see that's the thing\nSee here's the thing\nEvery time I go and turn back around\nPullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down\nIt doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'\nSo let's go do it now or never\nCause I been thinking bout forever\nYou're everything, see that's the thing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42d069fe8357b9423abc0b46d79ba08d.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
