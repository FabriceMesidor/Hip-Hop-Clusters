Down by law, I make law\nI be justice, I sentence that ass two to four\nRound the clock, that state pen time, check it\nBut the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime\nCame through with the Wu, slid off on the DL\nI'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells\nNow come aboard, it's Medina bound\nEnter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound\nIt's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel\nSo deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels\nNiggas are fascinated how the shit begin\nGet vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the MCs came to live out the name and to perform\nSome had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on\nNow on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born\nYo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut", "image": "https://images.genius.com/841993260ec6dbf12b80a5a3e780b041.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
