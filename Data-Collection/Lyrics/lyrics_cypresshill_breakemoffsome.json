Where ya gonna run to\nWhen I pull out the scooby doo\nRun! Let me break ya off some\nHit the floor cuz it ain't no fun\nBut here they come, they must wanna get done\nNo frontin'. Punk I'll break ya off somethin'!\n\n(1 2 3 that coppa goes down!)\n\nWhat the fuck I'm rollin'\nIn a Mack truck that's stolen\nGuess what I'm holdin'\nAmmo to bust my load\nStill I'm easin' on down\nThe yellow brick road\n\nWhatta ya know? A pig in a plain brown\nWrapper, he wanna bring me down\nI'll hit that corner, lemme just warn ya\nI'll bring ya ass down make ya family mourn ya\n21 gun salute, trying to take my loot\nDon't make me shoot\nI'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump\nAnd punk let me break ya of something\n\n(break em' off some)\n\nI got to roll with the self control\nIn the green tank when the shit unfolds\nHold up. I got it sewn up\nMe and my niggas are about to blow up\nGot the pigs on my tail, what they get\nIs the hollow point shell\nCaught in the cell\nServin' my sentence, got my apprentice\nIn the hood but the nigga is senseless\nOut on parole, now the nigga has\nTurned to my fold, now the punk gotta go\nThat punk got shady, woudn't repay me\nLet the punk know that ya still can't fade me\nMaybe the frontin' would stop, but nothin'\nWould stop me from havin' to break'em off something\n\n(On to the next spot kid\nWe ain't havin it yall\nYa know what I'm talkin bout\nI'm about to break your ass of some'n!\nCommin from a whamm-o)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4b9ab5e19ad3cb61a9b3e1bf8fc39c50.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
