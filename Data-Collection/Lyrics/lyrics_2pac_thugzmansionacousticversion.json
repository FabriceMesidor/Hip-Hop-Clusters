Where do niggas go when we die?\nAin't no heaven for a thug nigga\nThat's why we go to thug mansion\nThat's the only place where thugs get in free\nAnd you gotta be a G, at thug mansion\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nA place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind\nSo much pressure in this life of mine\nI cry at times, I once contemplated suicide\nAnd would've tried, but when I held that 9\nAll I could see was my mama's eyes\nNo one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble\nNot knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you\nPicture me inside the misery of poverty\nNo man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\nPrayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on\nMe and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on\nWe found a family spot to kick it\nWhere we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit\nA spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's\nWe still visualize places that we can roll in peace\nAnd in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast\nI got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion\n\n[Hook: J. Phoenix & (Nas)]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)\nNothing but peace, love\nAnd street passion (I wanna go, nigga)\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nA place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide\nNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by\nNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets\nNo reason for nobody's mama to cry\nSee, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter\nBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support her\nThis whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me\nOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe\n\u2018Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'\nI'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy\nI know she smiles on her boy\nI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur\n\u2018Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war\nAnd just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more\n\u2018Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne\nWhere angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion\n\n[Hook: J. Phoenix & (2Pac)]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nDear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle Latasha sure grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand only God can save us\nWhen Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist together\nThere has to be a place better than this in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion\n\n[Hook: J. Phoenix & (2Pac)]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\n(At thugs's mansion)\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f7dcd7bb697e66f11fe0520838cb066.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
