Keep me off it\nAt least quit lyin if you must keep talkin\nGone with the nine, see I just keep walkin\nBefore I have you suin' sendin lawyers to the office\nA lot of y'all, that's why I don't like that shawty\nA couple months off, I'll be right back shawty\nWith a brand new swag, and a brand new 40\nAnd a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it\nNation wide move, nigga, yeah you saw it\nShawty need a body gaurd for his body guard, don't he?\nTip fallin off, sound kinda hard don't it?\nY'all hate to see me ball\nTake it up with God, homie\n\n(Hook, Akon)\nI can see it in your eyes\nIt ain't hard to tell\nThey watchin you\nThey just tellin you lies\nThey want you to fail\nThey plottin on you\nSoooooo\nDon't believe 'em when they try to say it's over\nJust tell them you're number one\nYou're a champion", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68262ccdcbffb87427d31b0d6085c2e3.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
