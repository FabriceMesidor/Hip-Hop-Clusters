(Ho!)\nSimilar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think\nKeep it in the head like T\nSpit listerine on the beat\nFlossin' diamonds and me\nNow peep the way I deliver on the beat\nIs what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!\nThat's why yo chick want to pump me (right)\nShe want to be the chick from the other guy\nWanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh\nAs soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing\nHey I'm the other guy\nNow you wanna rumble why\nI mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya\nWet you up\nRoll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop\nThrowback line for those who been listening (Uh!)\nFor all the new listeners that boy just filling\nNiceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas\nMake up a wishlish\nCop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it\nAt this point forget it..\nI'm like a preganat woman I deliver\nNow pop it push it!\n\n[Chorus: Nickelus F]\nWe in hoodies and timbs\nOut on the grind\nRain or shine\nNickels and dimes\nI'm out tryna to get his paper\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\n(I gotta spill on this)\nThat's why I roll up and tend to get high\nCause my arms won't extend to the sky\nPeer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes\nSo I can only grab my pen and advise\nStreet legends and chicks seem to wonder\nExactly who I am\nYou know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup\nIt's Drake and Saint Nick\nTake a whiff of this and faint quick\nOff a sample of the flow patient\nBut I don't lie to rhymers\nI strip walls and apply the primer\nIf there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa\nWithout a graded rope\nOur navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me\nI'm always gon find another way to go\nI'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope\nNo bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap\nBegging for the fire\nBuglars in hear we\nWe all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya\nI dress like Lou, I sell verses to label\nAnd they give me the next joint\nTo sound less like you\nThat's something I had to say before\nI'm real picky with real with lyrics\nSo don't use joints you probably would pay me for\nI ain't' a heat busser\nWhat up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher\nLeak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya\nAnd then sign ya\nThis is a reminder\nThis along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song\nI'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong\nWe gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen\nNow she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'\nBring the topic back\nPlease don't stop the track\nTropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there\nMixtapes where I top em at\nDJ Smallz.com you can shop at that\nSpeak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal\nTryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real\nNo stealing cable trying to have my cable still\nBetter yet stolen, my grammar is golden\nMy grammer go harder than most rappers\nThere's a certain female rapper I will expose and\nFor once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing\nNo I didn't pen that Freestyle shit\nI got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that\nAnybody else get the piece that I bend back\nLet it marinate if you niggas dare to hate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d0129f5c63f1ee10f591e6ce8849c5c5.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
