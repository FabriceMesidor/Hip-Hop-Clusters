What's the numbers?\nHow much did you sell? What's the radio spins?\nHow much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?\"\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nCan you remind me again why we in this shit?\nMake it even more mellow, make it just the chords\n\n[Verse 1]\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nI know it's for more than just to get rich.\nSince when was making music about getting rich?\nSince when was making art about getting rich?\nI know it's easy for me to say\nBecause having money's not everything and not having it is\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again why the Grammy's could suck my dick?\nRemind me who's the original superfly\nAnd I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie\nRemind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?\nEvery nigga tryna get rich,\nEvery rapper tryna get rich,\nAnd every rapper always rap about fucking somebody else bitch\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nRemind me again why we in this shit?\nAnd why the Grammys can suck my dick\nSuck my dick\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd every motherfucking sponsor\nThey tryna put they logos all over the concerts and shit\nFor a meet and greet\nAnd you gotta meet the execs and they daughters\nAnd they'll show what they just bought her\nReal niggas don't live too long in this shit\nReal niggas don't live too long in this shit\nReal niggas don't live too long in this shit\nReal niggas don't live too long in this shit\nReal niggas don't live too long in this shit\nThey say \"Ayo, you coming on too strong in this bitch\"\nThey always talking about what I'm doing wrong in this shit\nWell I can give a fuck everything\nI can give a fucking anything\nRemind me why we in this shit\nI lost my motherfucking momma\nSo I can give a fuck about your comments\nI promise, I promise\nCause we all gonna die one day\nBut I'mma live my life my way!\nRemind me why we in this shit, please\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease, can I sell your drink for you, please\n\"So, you can help me put on a better show please, corporations?\nCan you please support me? Please?\nMe, Kanye West. I swear I\u2019m a nice nigga now\nI swear I\u2019ll put the pink polo back on,\nI swear to you. Please. Just for 3 million\nI need it so bad. I need a pool in my backyard!\nSo I\u2019ll tell all my fans your shit is cool\nAnd if they believe in me, then they should also believe in you\n\"\u2018Did we get the check yet? Hold on, I gotta call the business manager\nDid the corporations send the check?\nWhat is my public rating? Are people liking me again?\nEnough to get some money from the corporations?\nAre they liking me, is it ok now?\nThey forgot about the whole Beyonc\u00e9 thing, right?\nOk, Cool.\nIs it ok now?\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nRemind me why we in this shit\nRemind me why we in this shit\nCause we ain't on no pile of shit\nNigga I'mma make my music from my heart\nAnd I live and I die by everything that I say\nAnd everything that I do\nAnd everything that make is what I believe to be true\nAnd if the shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense\nI don't give a fuck because that was my stream of conscious\nAnd that's the way I felt at that time\nAnd feelings was the only facts\nAnd racism and materialism is killing blacks\nAnd one more thing if I can ask\nOne more thing if I can add\n\n[Verse 5]\nCause in this life, our life just moves to fast\nAnd time is somethng tht you can never get back\nWhat's your quality of life?\nWhat's your quality of life?\nAnd that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight\nI hope you have a good time tonight\nLondon, it's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight\n\n[Bridge]\nAn inspiration, not lead instruments\nI'm the lead instrument, but he's background\nHappy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen\nMy friend Louis Gold, Christopher King, Stella McCartney\nAnd Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume\n\n[Outro]\nBut it's still sometimes like there's no good ideas\nAnd no real ideas and nothing sincere left\nAnd everything has been so homogenized\nAnd it's all big business and it's no creativity\nBut really we have the ability to have a human Utopia\nIf we just helped each other\nIf we just use our resources\nAnd stop tryna compete against each other\nAnd tryna beat each other\nAnd eat each other\nAnd maybe came together and tried to teach each other\nAnd reach each other\nAnd reach each other\nMaybe try to come together and love each other\nAnd love each other\nAnd love one another\nMaybe try to come together and love each other\nAnd love each other\nAnd love each other\nAnd love another\nAnd love each other\nAnd love each other\nAnd love each other\nAnd love another\nThe way you love you love your mother man\nThe way you should love your father man\nY'all don't really understand\nCause this is our shit\nAnd is this our motherfucking clique\nClique, clique clique\nAin't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique\nClique, clique, clique\nI said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique\nClique, clique, clique\nI said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
