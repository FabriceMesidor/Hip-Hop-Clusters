Today\nBitch it\u2019s do or die, seven days a week and holidays\nHo ass bitch\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nI ain't felt the pressure in a little while\nIt's gonna take some getting used to\nFloatin' all through the city with the windows down\nPuttin' on like I used to\nThey never told me when you get the crown\nIt's gon' take some getting used to\nNew friends all in their old feelings now\nThey don't love you like they used to man", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/4102beea531512f6bd6b77e610f029fd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
