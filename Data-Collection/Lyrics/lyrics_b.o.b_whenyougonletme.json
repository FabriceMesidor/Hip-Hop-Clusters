(x4)\nThere's so much on your mind\nYou've been hurt before\nYou really can't trust them cause they all just wanna know (they all be asking)\nWhen you gon' let me fuck? (x4)\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nYou done been through this\nYou done been through that\nGave away your love\nBut did that come back? (no)\nNo it didn't come back\nNo it didn't come back\nAlways looking for another but they never really match\nYou trippin' over your past\nBut I'm trippin' off of that ass\nSayin' niggas all the same\nAll they wanna do is smash it\nOkay, you know, round and round we go\nFucking on the first night\nNo that don't make you a ho\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nShe about that life\nWhen the time get right (uh)\nBut tonight she like\nBoy you ain't my type (whaat?)\nDon't get me confused\nYou with them other dudes\nYeah they talk a good game\nBut don't live up to the height\nSo when you gon' let me\nRide that thang like a jet ski?\nSwim that thang like a motorboat?\nBeat your pussy up like a ?\nOkay, you know, round and round we go\nAnd I know we just met\nBut that don't make you a ho\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c15dbab29cd7e31286511ae5be6d5fed.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
