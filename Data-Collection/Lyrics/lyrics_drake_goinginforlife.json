I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency\u2019s imported\nBut too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with\nLawsuits even if those are acts that I did commit\nRepeat offender, Anita Baker\nPlayin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender\nI gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender\nA real Menschkeit as they say he\u2019s a legal bender\nAnd ATF is present every regal member\nThe coalition, is so efficient\nYou have to be invited or there's no admission\nWe know tradition\nWe spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position\nI wish you would listen\nI take you back to this trial\nWhere I am about to be home again like New Edition\nMy foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in\nUse to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in\nWhen pops turned over the keys like a new ignition\nIf Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen 'til I mention that I wanna play a new position\nNo team playin', no screen settin'\nBecause I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'\nThe take over, the break's over, nigga\nAnd I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over\nThe wait's over, the tape's coming\nThey bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing\nThe human mentality's so eager to hate something\nAnd try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'\nAnd it's the predicament that you found Drake in\nThe condo that I just purchased is sound vacant\nCause I have just been sittin' in this cell\nThinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking\nAnd whenever I'm flowing on the mic\nAside from talkin bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife\nI treat this one session as if it was my last\nAnd I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/866a4a7df935705e834f236499d617c6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
