I'll get you that\nP-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back\nIt ain't an industry, niggas I admit to that\nBut I don't even want your chain, I'll let the Crips do that\n12 bars for that bitch, he won't live through that\nEven a nigga with a ten year bid knew that\nPut a gun in his mouth yeah, yeah do that\nHe a pussy (sniff, sniff) his own kid knew that\nI'm Ready To Die, B.I.G. knew that\nHe ain't eatin, look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that\nYou cocksucker, let your ears do that\nOr ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap\n2 Lincoln Continentals sittin back to back\nLeavin' Jersey City naw nigga, Hackensack\nWhere's that? Somewhere where the crackers at\nReal far from where the roaches and rats is at\nCome to Compton I'll show you where the racquet's at\nDown the street from the Staples Center where they Hack-a-Shaq\nGive the advance money back, I ain't have to rap\nBreak Harry-O out tell him crack is back\nThat's nine five a bird take half of that\nImport it, export it in cracker jacks\nWhen you get to the projects, ask for Black\nYou know what you started with? Give him half of that\nHe gon give you 50 G's in a plastic sack\nAnd I'mma give you 3,500 cash for that\nGotta keep your mouth closed or I'mma blast the mac\nThey won't believe you the whole world know that bastard rap\nOnce you're out of the throne, you can't have it back\nRetirement home and ain't nothing after that\nExcept you layin' in a casket, black suit on\nYou can't go to heaven with Timberland boots on\nNo subliminals, I ain't talkin to you Shawn\nI'm talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on\nWho the fuck put you on\nFaggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons\nI fuck with Fab, get my DJ Clue on\nSit inside Hot 97 with no tools on\nAnd it don't matter if it's Sway or Kay Slay\nAngie Martinez I'll take 'em back to KDAY\nThey act like they forgot about Dre-day\nI don't rap for Free that's why they fired AJ\nIt's me leaking through your stereo\nEnvy me as an MC, prepare for your burial\nI kill niggas without lettin' the Desert blow\nRazor tongue and I'm far from Haitian son\nAll black like the Range Rover wheels\nNiggas whisper around The Game like The Game won't kill\nLet me show you the scars, take you back to the car\nRewind time, March 3, 1994\nI was only in my teens, deuce-deuce in my Levi's\nWhen Nas hit the scene I was still rockin' knee-highs\nRunnin' with my brother Fase, he was 17\nTwo guns in the upper waist, so we hit the block\nSaw niggas from a rival gang bumpin Dre\nRan up on the '64 and that's all she wrote\nWe runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin' Radames\nFirst murder and I did that without a mask\nFast-forward, see Game gettin out a Jag\nTwo piece suit on, he still got his rag\nGangbangin' forever, he still got his swag\nLet me catch you in Los Angeles without a pass\nEverybody in New York know that you a fag\nCome out the closet, show the world how to use a pad\nSpeakin' death on my red bandana\nNaw, he couldn't have said that, so I raised my antennas\nLook at my Nextel, got a call from Santana\nThat nigga a pussy, we just saw him in Atlanta\nSo I hopped on the first thing smokin' to Atlanta\nPulled up at 112 ran up on that black Phantom\nSecurity hopped out, no Joe in here\nJust Outkast gettin' ready for a show in here\nSo I uncocked the .44\nHopped in the cherry low-low\nChrome grill with the G-Unit logo\nWe watched Hov go, now the world waitin for my solo\nI'm the man, Stat Quo know\nI ain't gotta explain, even Bo know\nHalf of these rap niggas is faker than rolls gold\nGet hit in the face with the back of the .44\nAnd pissed on tryin to play The Game with a broke nose\nMy bitch harder than you, yeah Vida loco\nI ain't sold one record got rap in a chokehold\nI'm Dre certified like the leader of the band\nRun up, you sure to die, I'll leave you where you stand\nSmurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man\nBut he peed in his pants when he saw us at Summer Jam\nLucky I wasn't there, I had to bury my man\nOr I would've terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam\n\"What you mean terrorize New York?\"\nI mean expose these pussy ass niggas like I'm Too $hort\nSomebody tell Domination I'll leave him in parts\nLeg in Jersey, arm in Brooklyn, head buried in Central Park\nHe can't walk through New York no more like John Stark\nGot a call cause I'm a break his ankles like Hot-Sauce\nAsk niggas from your hood I'm thorough in 5 boroughs\nSit on any stoop, Pelli Tims in the thermal\nWait till Alpo come home\nLike Azie from Harlem, Dre gon' pay me regardless\nCause he know Jay-Z departed\nAnd these other rap labels know don't feed they artists\nTalkin blueprint shit you got three garages\nGettin money off Roc like little E and Carter\nShowin off your little chain like these is flawless\nSend him 50 cent a day I can see he starvin'\nI got R&B bitches givin' me m\u00e9nages\nDeep massages, I could hear Eazy talkin\nTellin me to have a seat in Tomica's office\nBuy Ruthless and get Lil' E involved in\nPromote without that magazine in Boston\nTake a couple mil, make Beans a offer\nGive him money we don't see that often\nBut it was all a dream, like I seen Memph Bleek in Marcy\nI ain't say you won't see Bleek in Marcy\nI said my man told me he don't see Bleek in Marcy\nI'm from Compton where niggas used to bleed for Barkley's\nDrive lo-lo's and we ain't need keys to start 'em\nJust a little information for your summer vacation\nBring your chain cause every nigga in L.A. waitin'\nMad cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers\nAnd they'll kill you cause they can't find Gary Payton\nMeanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band ain't makin' it\nShyne got a new deal, Def Jam gotta pay us\nPlayboy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in\nNiggas got beef with G-Unit but ain't sayin' shit\nQuiet as a church on Tuesdays\nNiggas say they hate my music, but my alert's on they 2-ways\nNigga I'm a hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis\nTouch kids but I do that with a semi-automatic\nWith or without traffic I pull my shit out and blast it\nI'm blind to the masses like Stevie Wonder without glasses\nI'm a savage spit murder like a .38 Magnum\n16 bars'll baggum let the hook toe tag 'em\nMurder any MC throw 'em in that white wagon\nLet him die and come back look at 'em, he white flaggin'\nSpreadin' rumors like, \"When I see Game I might jack him\"\nI'm tellin' the world: he reach for my chain, I might clap him\nCause niggas shot me in 2001\nTook one in the heart cause I was too proud to run\nThe clip was empty when the police found my gun\nSo I don't bring that gangbangin' shit around my son\nNigga 50 took 9 he know how it feel\nAnd I found out Buck got shot up in Cashville\nAnd Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit\nAnd Yayo just came home (G-G-G-Unit)\nBackstage at a D-12 concert\nA fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoop's Converse\nNiggas show me love when they see me in the streets\nBut they frown when I don't want to hear none of they beats\nNigga, this shit crazy\nEm said some shit when was 16, now they tryin to ruin Slim Shady\nI forgive him, I got problems of my own\nHow you think the streets gon' act now that Suge got home\nThese niggas is birds, I can see the feathers on 'em\nIf Doc give me the word, I put this Berretta on 'em\nWhen the beef is on, my piece is on\nWhite sheets is on 'em, Doc breathin on 'em\nAnd I got an extra clip in my Reeboks\nCause I'm in and out my socks every time I see cops\nGame got the streets locked\nCall 911, get the whole fuckin LAPD shot\nNiggas snitchin' to the street cops\nGet your nephews and your niece shot\nWhen my heat cocked, then the beat stop\nNigga with a attitude like I heard Dr. Dre doin' \"Detox\"\nNiggas fightin' for the throne that ain't shit\nTryin to measure the fallin' legends but the shoe won't fit\nNiggas might think I'm ridin' dick\nCause I'm at the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Unit's\nTryin to talk to Jesus Christ into lettin' me dig 'em up\nSo they could stand side by side again and live it up\nThis might be the last time you hear me biggin 'em up\nWith \"Suicidal Thoughts\" bangin' me and my bitch in the truck\nMy conscience tellin' me if I put the clip in the buck\nIt might be loud enough to wake B.I.G and them up\nWhat if that was P. Diddy sittin' in the truck\nAnd 2Pac was in jail the day he recorded \"Hit 'em Up\"?\nI wouldn't be outside 40/40 bumpin' Jigga What\nWouldn't be signed to Dr. Dre, I wonder is it luck\nThey got me on MTV with Banks, Fifth, and Buck\nI ain't tryin' to be L.A.'s king, he carry a pimp cup\n\n[Outro]\nSnoop Dogg got the crown, nigga\nWhat the fuck y'all mad at me for?\nI ain't sold one fuckin' record\nI'm just tryin' to use these 200 bars to feed my family, nigga\nI ain't no threat\nI can't rap, I'm from Compton remember?\nYou gotta be out your motherfuckin' mind\nAsk Kay Slay, ask Clue, ask Whoo Kid, ask Funk Flex\nI'll murder anyone of you motherfuckers\nG-G-G-G-Unit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4001f8ec11319dd66b2ff52d4528a097.360x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
