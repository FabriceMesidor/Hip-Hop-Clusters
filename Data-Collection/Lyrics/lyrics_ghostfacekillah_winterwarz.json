kid?\n(RZArector)\n\n[Hook: Raekwon & (Cappadonna)]\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\n[Verse 1: U-God]\nThis rhyme you digest through the RZA console\nAsk why I slam Nine Diagram pole\nRaekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback Notre Dame\nGolden Arms is bronze Buddha palm hit Qu'ran\nIt blows extreme, mainstream be the theme, supreme team\nAmerica's Cream Team, redeemed\nVidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone\nGun POW to the dome and split the bone\nWig blown off the ledge by the alleged\nFull-fledged, sledge RZA edge\nOne dose of my feroc' handheld trigger cuts\nA capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched\nAnd critical mic cords, hanging like umbilical\nCords, dope swords, five star general\nRaw be the quote rap style sore throat\nThrough the fully operational, hand held tote, mhm\n\n[Hook: Raekwon]\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\n[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]\nA hundred thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done\nI hold a title, and here's how my belt was won, check it\nSlick majestic, broke mics are left infected\nGerms start to spread through your crew through lack of effort\nYou asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes\nMy technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges\nMasked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind\nWith a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear\nSo sit back and let the king explore\nDescribe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords\nAnd his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines\nWith more gains than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains\nPoisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this\nYou get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this\nSide effects of hot raps and hot tracks\nA duffel bag full of guns son, dipped in black\nMy culture, glides and attacks you like a vulture\nGhostface in Madison Square is on your poster\n\n[Hook: Raekwon & (Cappadonna)]\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\nYes the hour's four, I told you before\nPrepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)\n\n[Verse 3: Masta Killa]\nBe on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect\nThat fills more body bags than apartments in projects\nAnd as far as the coroners know\nThe autopsy show it was a Shaolin blow\nPut on by my family brought to the academy\nOf the Wu and learnt how to\nFuck up your anatomy steadily, calm and deadly\nSpatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit\nMCs submit to the will as I kill your\nJuvenile freestyle, civilize the mental\nDevils worship this like an icon\nBear-hugging mics with the grips of a python\n\n[Hook: Raekwon]\nYes the shit is raw coming at your door\nStart to scream out loud, \"Wu-Tang's back for more\"\n\n[Verse 4: Cappadonna]\nYou heard other raps before but kept waiting\nFor the Son of Song, I keep dancehalls strong\nBeats never worthy of my cause, I prolong\nExtravaganza, time sits still\nNo propaganda, be wary of the skill\nAs I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum\nDedicated to rap nigga, beware of the fearsome\nLebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat\nCD massacre, murder to cassette\nI blow the shop up, you ain't seen nothing yet\nOne man ran, tryna get away from it\nPut your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh\nInto your chamber like Freddy enter dream\nDiscombumberate your technique and your scheme\nFour course applause, like a black dat to dat\nYou're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map\nNowhere to go except next show bro\nEntertaining motherfuckers can't stop O\nIn battling, you don't want me to start tattling\nAll up on the stage 'cause y'all snakes keep rattling\nBitch, you ain't got nothing on the rich\nEvery other day my whole dress code switch\nSo just in case you wanna clock me like Sherry\nAll y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry\nCan't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen\nEven if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out\nI'm too ill, I represent Park Hill\nSee my face on the twenty dollar bill\nCash it in, and get ten dollars back\nThe fat LP with Cappachino on the wax\nPass it in your thing, put valve up to twelve\nPut all the other LPs back on the shelf\nAnd smoke a blunt and dial 9-1-7\n1-6-0-4-9-3-11\nAnd you could get long dick hip-hop affection\nI damage any MC who step in my direction\nI'm Staten Island best son, fuck what you heard\nNiggas still talking that shit is absurd\nMy repertoire, is U.S.S.R\nP.L.O. style got thrown out the car\nAnd ran over by the Method Man Jeep\nDivine can't define my style is so deep\nLike pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy\nLike a porcupine, I part backs like a spine\nGut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design\nI know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind\n'Cause you weak in the knees like SWV\nTryna get a title like Wu Killa Bee\nKid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott\nMe and RZA rhyme name printed in the tablet\nUnder vets, we paid our debts for mad years\nHibernate the sound and now we out like bears\nIn Born Power, born physically, power speaking\nThe truth in the song be the pro-black teaching", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aaa4a25c81fd34a671c2db7083cc80.800x800x1.jpg"}],
