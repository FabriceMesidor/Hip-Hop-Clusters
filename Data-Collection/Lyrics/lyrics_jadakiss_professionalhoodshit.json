Where it at?\nCoupe is the same color as the nine-five Air Max\nYeah I'm a gentle boss that'll send you back to heaven\nMake a nigga dental floss with the Mac-11\nIn front of the store, breaking down on a crate\nI'm working out now and not eating after eight\nLet 'em know I'm a monster right now\nAnd the empire's about to be conquered right now\nAnd all you gon' hear about is Yonkers right now\nAnd I own a couple pair of shoes...\nYeah but I'm the don of Nike Town\nThe haze is purple, the diesel is sour\nIt's a shame that most people evil with power\nBut the key to surviving, dog, is logic\nAnd it's a lot riding on this project\nAll I know is death is coming nigga\nAnd getting money is the object", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1c8402a55fdbc84ca7b4917a823d724.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
