But pretend I'm in perfect health\nThat's the problem I guess\nI focused on the wrong things\nMy art is a way to help me\nBut this isn't really healthy...\nI'm just tryna vent\nCold air through my window\nI've been running from my past since the intro\nI'm just looking for some justice, wins low\nAnd the losses getting loud, crescendo\nI don't, even, hear the, crowd\nI have been drowned in my mental\nAnd they don't even listen in the first place\nSo I guess I'll just fade away\nInvisible, worst case\n(Fuck)\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c919a00200647c646c275a32d9d66956.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
