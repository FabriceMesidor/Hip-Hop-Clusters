Hello?\nYo, I can't, I can't hear you\nLet me call you right back\n\n[Verse]\nI sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do\nI got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?\nThe FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon\nI might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon\nI might be seein' rockets light up the night sky\nRight outside the window of my living room\nAnd if they do, you can say good night\nAnd bye-bye to them my tunes\nIf I don't try to record as much before I do\nThe plan is to have as many in the can as I can\nAs I stand before you in this booth a walking-dead man\nBlank stare, dead pan, look on my face\nAs I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van\nAs I mysteriously disappear into thin air\nAnd they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere\nAnd I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech\nWho hid behind the freedom of speech\nTried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it\nAnd ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid\nStupendous way to end this\nI can feel the tremors tremendous\nIn remembrance of September 11th\nFlashback to September 7th\nWhen 2Pac was murdered in Vegas\nHe said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it\nShould we ever live to regret it\nLike the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day\nBy the crazed lunatic with a gun\nWho just happened to work on the same block\nIn the library book depository\nWhere the President would go for a little Friday stroll\nShots fired from the grassy knoll\nBut they don't know, or do they?\nWho's they for them to say \"touch\u00e9\"?\nWe're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay\nThis is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now\nCount down to nuclear meltdown\nSeven, six, five, four, three, two, one\nYou can run, you can do what you want to\nBut you know you ain't gonna do nothin'\nWhen it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target\nYou have become Public Enemy number one", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86576cfe4dc7027bc0fed03da7e37e9a.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
