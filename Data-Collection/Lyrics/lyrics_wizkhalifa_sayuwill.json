Knievel, showing you niggas how to stunt\nI mess up flows like waves and potholes\nWest Coast, I fuck hoes and eat Roscoes\nGot gold\nWith diamonds in it\nAll the finest linen\nVersace\nCity tryna lock me (Hahahaha)\nThat's my Biggie flow right there\nI dunno if y'all caught that\nThat's that Biggie flow though\nYeah, bitch! Khalifa man, '09 star year\nGot what you need right here, boy\nQuit tryna be somebody and be yourself\nYeah (Hahaha)\nAnd um...
