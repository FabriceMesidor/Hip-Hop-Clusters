Fuck that, I'ma fold niggas\nMake a mothafuckin' example out him, I'ma show niggas\nAround the way I done told them niggas\nFuck the OGs, we got the same type of guns as them older niggas\nI know he killed the dawg so I'm holdin' grudge\nIt's a homi' on any and everybody that he love\nHold up, there go his man Mick\nIn the car with his kids, I'ma split his mothafuckin' wig\nFollow him to the crib and park up the block\nGo in the trunk, grab my mothafuckin' 40 Glock\nOn my way thinkin' this nigga gotta get it\nI'ma empty out the clip so that Tony gets the message\nKick in the door, started lettin' off\nMick fell through the table, got wrapped up in the tablecloth\nSkated off in the darkness of night\nLeft my callin' card on the body and said \"fuck your life\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nShit is brutal, I gotta get made then bounce\n36 seasons, I'm stuck back on the couch\nLike a potato, I don't play though\nI'm stone cold son, these lames is built like Play-Doh\n[?]\nI seen Mick's body on the floor covered in sheets\nAnd a note that says I'm a dead man walkin'\nAn empty soul just headed for the coffin\nThis is crazy, they took my brother, they must be clueless\nI'ma get that mothafucka, I'm ruthless\nRelentless, [?] than a dusted out Navy Seal\nI'ma skin him alive, that's for real\nI ain't goin' nowhere, they let the beast out the cage\nThe face of a killer, straight up, on a rampage\nWar path, blood bath, a killing spree\nI'ma show these mothafuckas how it's meant to be\n\n[Hook] x2\nAyo go against the grain, I smell a massacre\nI'll stick a bomb in your limo, blow up your passengers\nKill every one of 'em, leave no witnesses\nTime for revenge, now live out your sentences\n\n[Outro]\nI ain't goin' nowhere\nI ain't goin' nowhere\nY'all mothafuckas comin' for my head?\nThis is Tony Starks, you can't stop me, mothafucka\nNigga I wipe my dick on your spaghetti fork, nigga\nI'm gettin' this money, nigga, for life, nigga, forever\nAnd I ain't talkin' 'bout shoebox money neither, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b7e8d5889ca7a25f1f186a54b799b1ab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
