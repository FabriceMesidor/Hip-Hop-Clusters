Ros\u00e9 in my champagne glass\nAnd diamonds in my ring\nRoll something\nThat's your bitch on my dick?\nWell, I'mma let her hold something\nYou niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!\nSame ones that hate same ones that tag along\nThem black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone\nCall me \"World Wide Wiz\" cause I'm never home\nEver leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned\nAnd you know that I rock camos and brought fros back\nAnd go download some of my old tracks\nAnd go play somewhere songs at\nFuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high\n\n[Hook - Kid Cudi]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57fc91d7548f4e591a971ea7f5443a88.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
