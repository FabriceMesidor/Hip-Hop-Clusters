It's Miller Time\n(Nah man, just kick a little more)\nPass the brass knuckles let me break his jaw\nWhen I'm on the microphone I want silence\nLet KRS-One stop the violence\nAin't no rivals, ain't no competition\nPunk, I'm beatin' you into submission\nI'm gettin' busier than ever before\nNever more will I slack I'mma keep it real raw\nEat you up like a pack-jam\nVideo's more popular than Batman\nRippin' you to shreds, tap you in the head\nThen leave the battle lookin' happy as a newlywed\nGive me a Tec-9 to spray\nSave the beef and put it on lay-away\nI'm in command your man abandons on the table fans will understand\nThen you weep about the murdergram", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22e65b653eb6ded3289c8de99a5e66f7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
