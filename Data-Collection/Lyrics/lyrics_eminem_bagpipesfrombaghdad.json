You needs a boyfriend?\nYou need some ointment? Just set up an appointment\nWho's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip\nI just got my one-year sobriety coin chip\nWhen the bad get going, how bad does the going get?\nBaby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with\nEach other, especially when you're joined at the hip\nI'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit\nAnd attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit\nLure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip\nCookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic\n\n[Chorus]\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nWhen will it ever cease?\nFor Pete's sake, he's crazy to say the least\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nWhat's going through my mind\nHalf the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nSomebody turn the vacancy sign on\n'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nI run the streets and act like a madman\nHolding a Glad bag, oh, bagpipes from Baghdad\n\n[Outro]\nHghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah\nHghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah\nHghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah\nHghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/280d45965a412d7e2a115e2db61d79f2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
