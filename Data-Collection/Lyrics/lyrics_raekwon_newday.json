This what it does\nJust keep it in the family, all love\nLets put the plugs together and cake up, build up the buzz\nI write for real niggas who down, bring your hound with you\nThrow em a jewel with meat on it, now did you\nAnalyze it like a 27 inch, give me the wrench\nSo we can throw a niggas some heroin and Jane and Finch\n\n[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]\nBitch I'm from the ski mask school house\nWhere life stay complicated, intoxicated and gooned out\nAnd niggas ain't graduated but they can relate with they tool belt\nThat 2 for 10 crack stems, needles and spoons out\nOoh I need some paper, ooh my fingers itching\nI wish that Santa Claus would put a brick under my tree for Christmas\nA new wig for my bitch and two choppers off in my stocking\nBaking soda yola'n locking, you cop then drop the deposit\nSigned my life right on the dotted line, wrote it in blood\nGot my uncle wiping down my tires, sold em a dub\nNiggas know I rap for most of my days, I rap with my plug\nBefore I see my platinum album, I see my day with the judge, fuck it\nWhen I die tell my mama I'm in the mafia\nEcuadorian chick 'bout to scoop me up from LaGuardia\nA party you wanna stop but you can't give up the sport\nLittle stove Pyrex and fork, shouts to East New York, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19a80eba7163d77cbc2f82096b06010e.612x612x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
