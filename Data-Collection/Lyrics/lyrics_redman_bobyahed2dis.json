Where a nigga like you'd get laughed at\nAnd since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap\nThe creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker\nRepresent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the Preacher\nA menace like Dennis, I got game like Ennis\nI can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence\nLord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with\nDroppin dope shit after dope shit, we're atrocious\nThat's from the lungs, that rings from here to kingdom come\nAnd I don't have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!!\n\nSo fuck what ya heard, word to herb\n'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama\nPlus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ\n(From Newark New Jersey, in the place to be)\nSo fuck what ya heard, word to herb\n'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama\nPlus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ\n(Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me)\n(Is they here to stay?)\n(I'll be outside when you get there)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d90c906f33a174fa71425b4dd339eb96.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
