(huh?)\nTold you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did!)\nGave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl\nSold a billion tapes and still screamed, \"Fuck the world!\"\n(Slim Shady...) so come and kill me while my name's hot\nAnd shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)\nI think I got a generation brainwashed\nTo pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)\nStop they blood flow until they veins clot\nI need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch\nPurple haze and acid raindrops\nSpike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)\nShaved my armpits and wore a tank top\nBad Boy, I told you that I can't stop\nYou gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you\nSo everybody buy my shit or I'mma come and kill you\n\n[Hook]\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need, some new weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin\n(I'm Slim Shady...)
