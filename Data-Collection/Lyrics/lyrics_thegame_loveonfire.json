What the fuck we doing?\nSomething happen to you, my whole fucking life is ruined\nLet the Lord take me from my fucking mama , I'mma kill myself\nBreak in heaven then it's goin' be drama\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nI don't never wanna know how Kanye feel\nBut right now I wouldn't mind seeing how a K feel\nFuck being Game, fuck being rich\nAnybody that ever owe me money I feel like Money Making Mitch\nI can't make dinner but I can make a fucking ditch\nMy pops ain't even checked on her , you a fucking bitch\nHeaded to Compton right now I'mma see you there\nMatter fact it's better off, I just leave you there\nAnd let you rot nigga, till you in a box nigga\nFrom now on it's thug life I'm positive I'm Pac, nigga\nReakin' havoc on the world for what could be\nI'm out here, dare any nigga try to Suge me\nWho grew up in Compton? Who was born in Inglewood? Me\nTwo days left on Death-row is where I should be\nBut I'm right here waiting for her to wake up\nLike please don't die mama, wake up\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f04f9b2892eac01c8dd7876593883785.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
