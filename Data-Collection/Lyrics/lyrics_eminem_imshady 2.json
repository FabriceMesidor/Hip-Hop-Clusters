(Huh?)\nTold you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)\nGave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl\nSold a billion tapes, and still screamed \"Fuck the world\"\n(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot\nAnd shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)\nI think I got a generation brainwashed\nTo pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot\nStop they blood flow 'til they veins clot\nI need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch\nPurple haze and acid raindrops\nSpike the punch at the party and drink pop\nShaved my armpits and wore a tank top\nBad Boy, I told you that I can't stop\nYou gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you\nSo everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you\n\n[Chorus]\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin\n(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)\nI like birds, bees, I like people\nI like funny things that make me happy and gleeful\nLike when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool\nThe ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike\nWhile I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like\n'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)\nI don't want to just die a normal death\nI wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)\nI just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat\nWhen they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet\nSo bring the money by tonight\n'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife\nShe ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)\nI try to keep it positive and play it cool\nShoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school\n(Stay in school)\nCause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better\nTonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter\n\n[Chorus]\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin\n(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nYo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it\n(Ahh, that shit is wack)\nSix months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit\n(That's my shit)\nPeople don't buy shit no more, they just dub it\nThat's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit\n(Yup, uh-huh)\nBut they love it when you make your business public\nSo fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)\nAnd if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it\n'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it\nWell, I do take pills, don't do speed\nDon't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)\nDon't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)\nI just wanna make a few things clear\nMy baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching\nAnd I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'\nIt's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested\nI don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested\n\n[Chorus]\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin\n(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady\n\n[Outro]\nI told you I was Shady (Yup)\nY'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)\nI'm Shady\nAnd that's my name", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18fd7ff1ba2db7ae16a26498fc58bb64.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
