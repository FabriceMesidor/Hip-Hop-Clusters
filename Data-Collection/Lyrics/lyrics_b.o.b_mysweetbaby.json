I know\n\n[Verse One]\nWell it's Mr. Obituary, put beats in a cemetery\nI rip a beat to pieces, like sheets in a dictionary\nThe teachers try tried to teach me but I was sleepin' in every class\nI never passed, it didn't seem necessary\nI'm super psychedelic\nI'm smokin' weed with the fairies\nAnd if drugs are bad, throw away every CD you carry\nCause drugs have inspired every musical visionary\nAnd this ain't even the album\nSo the thought alone should be scary\nI do this for the geeks who feel they need to compare me\nI swear I'll push this button, give me a reason or dare me\nAnd everything gets blown and everybody gets buried\nAnd there you have it, I shot the track like Berry\n\n[Hook]\nLady (oh yeah)\nOh, baby (oh yeah)\nOh, baby (oh yeah)\nOh, baby (oh yeah)\nMy, my baby (oh yeah)\nOh, baby (oh yeah)\nMy sweet baby (oh yeah)\nYou're the one\nI know, I know, I know, haha\n\n[Verse Two]\nThey tryin' figure out, what's my business incentive\nI'm simply tryin' speak to who or whatever will listen\nAnd reach out to the kids who the doctor prescribed with Ritalin\nSo this for all of my aliens and all the Indigo Children\nAnd anyone who said I would never see this position\nAllow me to drop my pants and turn around for you to kiss it\nHuh\nBut that was the motivation I needed for me to get it\nAnd this has been a Bobby Ray Power Point presentition\nI mean... presentation...\nAww, whatever you don't care", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43ec171838184bac0a8baa89f9e6d0a9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
