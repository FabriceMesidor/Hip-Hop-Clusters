than this success, than getting it\n\n[Bridge: Big Sean]\nWhere my real niggas that's gon' ride for me\nWhere my fine freaks that's gon' ride me\nWhere my real niggas that's gon' ride for me\nWhere my fine freaks that's gon' ride me\n(Finally famous nigga)\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\n\n[Verse 1: Meek Mill]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nI'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah\nWhen they view ya fucking around\nMe and my niggas we come in your town\nBusting them bottles and fucking your bitches\nAnd when they start hating we gunning them down\nDon't fuck 'em around, boy I get money all day\nAnd I ball hard like Tim Hardaway\nI can see a bad bitch from far away\nLet her ride this dick cause I had a hard day\nAnd my dick even harder, you whippin' the charger\nYou put your rims on and you think that you're balling\nI'm whippin' a Bentley, I can't even call it\nAnd my shit so retarded I handicap parking like SKRRRRRR!\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more

federales, I smoke medicali\nB-I-G Sean don, Juan Perion\nBitch fuck with me, I bet I make it work\nI oopsy-daisys on a skirt\nFuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt\nI prefer brown liquor, brown ladies, brown Louis Vuitton\nCondom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform\nNigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches\nBy candle lit, and that\u2019s cause the power\u2019s out\nAnd not for no romance and shit (No!)\nFrom barely managing to mansions\nWhere ho\u2019s call me Mr. Anderson\nCommand a bitch, no I don\u2019t own the pussy I just sample it\nI got a couple marbles missing I know\nNow there\u2019s marbles all on the floor\nOn the bathroom, kitchen and stove\nI got bitches on my cellular callin' and confessing\nBut I don\u2019t reply cause thats the clearest way to send a message\nPaper running through my jugular\nI\u2019m blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk\nYou know my style\nAnd my momma still say she proud, that\u2019s mula\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\n\n[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]\nI'm winning, I don't owe nann nigga shit\nCame in this motherfucker by myself\nSmoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH\nMy gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine\nNigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline\nAnd I touchdown, goal line, y'all ain't killing shit\nBrrrraatttt, shoot every nigga in your clique\nI'm on one, let me jog your memory\nMe and Nells on the milerun, uh\nShawty gonna need her drawers done\nEat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh\nAnd I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me\nTwo niggas with guns, snatch yo' wallet\nThat's pickpocket, they want my I.D, and I spaz on em'\nTreat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'\nGot a new chopper and that bitch still got a tag on it\nIf you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless\nSo I'm about to be dumb as fuck\nCause' God blesses fools in badges\nWhen I was fifteen I was felon\nWhen you were fifteen you were yelling:\n\"Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon, DAMN IT!\"\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\n\n[Verse 4: Earlly Mac]\nScared money never gon' make nothin', (thats right)\nGotta get it my medula\nCouple dollars in the waist band, (thats right)\nNigga hula-hoop with the mula\nEveryday that I wake I say grace\nHallelujah welcome back like Mase\nBitches only fuck niggas with the cream\nA nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date\nAy, they say we can't maintain\nOnly real niggas remain\n'Ye say that we the new slaves\nI need to ball with a chain\nI got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month\nWith some twins so big she can put em' in a bunk\nOoh I love it when she drop it and spread it like\u00a0\nWhen I see the camel all I wanna do is hump\nOkay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name\nGot a mural on the wall I'mma legend\nOkay, I'm from the motor city and been have drive\nI just need a little gas in my engine\nOkay, we all in the game and we ballin' the same but\nHome team nigga thats a blessing\nI'm a bad mothafucker just tryna get some credit\nSo good it can get me into heaven, nigga\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't
