from the top, from the top\nIn a state of grace\nWhere the talent is surrounded by the pain and the violence\nSo the selling never safe\nAt the same time snitching to the Jake\nIs the quickest way to get found at the bottom of a lake\nBut the problem we face seems so great\nThat we can't escape so we accept our fate\nSo the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint\nIf an artist is a part of a community\nAnd got an opportunity to get that cake\nWould never come back to the hood, no immunity\nUsually a nigga like that so fake,no different from a snake\nNothing left to give cause you always wanna take\nIf you ain't using all the talents God provided you with\nFor the betterment of man, understand you ain't nothing but a waste\nLook into the face of a young girl\nRaising up like a flag when it's unfurled\nGot game listening to her mother's pearls\nAnd she love Beyonce cause she run the world\nHer mama used to run this city\nWay back before the nigga Puff was Diddy\nWhen it came to the music then she got real picky\nFrom New York, but preferred 2Pac over Biggie\nNo disrespect to Ms. Wallace, but she liked to do the knowledge\nAnd she felt that Pac was more lyrical\nPlus she never went to college\nBut she called herself 'Earth' found rhythm with the gods more spiritual\nShe God in the physical\nAnd it's only natural to pray for a little you\nMusical so she played the umbilical chords\nSo her daughter was born it was a miracle\nMusic is the light when it's dark\nAnd the way that you spit your dart is a big part\nShe grew up loving hip hop\nNow all her daughter got is \"Love & Hip Hop\"\nNowadays niggas turn up for the sex\nNiggas turn up for the money, never turn up for the movement\nRatchet reality stars that be looking so stupid\nGetting in the fights at reunions\nShe used to be inspired by the writers, now she's tired of the biters\nNo desire for the lying and the violence\nThat's inflicted on the body in a so-called party environment\nHer body is politics\nLost count of how many whores she was called today\nShe won't do it no more, lost all her faith\nThey say she exaggerate when she hollerate\nBut it's only so much she can tolerate\n\n[Hook: Abby Dobson]\nHelp me find my way to a state of grace\nStir my heart, touch my soul\nFeed me freedom sounds you made\nHelp me find my way to a state of grace\nLift me up with your weight\nPull me to the grace\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nShe wanna to be the first in her family with a higher education\nHer entire graduation was a dire situation\nDid a paper on the state of the hip hop generation\nBut no longer felt a part of the conversation\nUsed to be I'm a ''ride or die'' chick\nB.I.G. with the ''Me And My Bitch''\nNo objections, being an object,major label seeing a profit\nShe ain't never been a bitch or a ho\nBut she used to sing along when she heard it in a song\nShe used to be front row at the shows 'til she overdosed on the testosterone\nHer favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed\nBut she felt like she really ain't belong\nWhen she wouldn't let him hit, this nigga called her a bitch\nShe erased all her songs from the phone\nYou are who you fuck with, so the guy that she stuck with\nYou can bump it or dump it, the artist she trusted\nJust broke her heart, so misogynistic and disgusting\nShe tried not to judge him, in her heart she still loved him\nAnd the way that he lusting, a part of his suffering\nAnd this young man, clearly not ready for the harder discussion\nFemale emcees acting more like a dude than a dude do, only if you knew\nI know a few who flow crazier than if you flew over the nest of the cuckoo\nBut she never gonna hear them in the mix so the new attitude\nTaking cues from the radio playing that doodoo\nShe on D'Angelo Pandora station playing that Voodoo, who knew?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nIn the face of hate\nShe'd be lucky for a balance cause the world is challenging her to be great\nI see lyrics as colors and shapes\nPut it on tape, let her know I could relate\nWhen you wish you could switch the way that you look\nAnd your nose was smaller and your hair was straight\nWhen you got no faith\nWhen you hate yourself, when you hate your race\nLet's get to the core\nOur sisters worth more than grinding on the wall half-naked\nShe a bitch, she a whore\nAnd you rich and you shit on the poor\nIn all of your records and ask 'em to buy it\nWhy should I support music that constantly disrespects me?\nAnd make you dismissive of the efforts of those who get left\nWith the charge of repping it correctly\nWhen it's free online or in a cloud\nAin't no reason to touch the radio dial\nYou wonder why you don't hear no sounds on the air\nAnd it's clear that your sales going down\nDown by law then you found the raw\nOn a message board and you sounding off\nThese niggas get the whole world, but what's the cause?\nNo wonder why these niggas be sounding lost\nRhyming is a memory\nThe assembly line rap niggas is designed by the enemy\nStop giving them your soul, gift wrap\nPrepackaged, fabricated shit rap\nRunning through you like fast food -  Big Mac's\nYou don't want no problems, fix that\nAll the time that you spent listening to that bullshit\nNow you ain't never gon' get back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Talib Kweli]\nShe don't love it, no\nShe don't love it no more",
