Now can you feel my soul?\nThat's they way that I think with every line\nAnd I'm a be that deep til the day I die\nSo if you feel me now, sing one time\n(Ooooohhhh)\n\n[Verse Two: B.o.B]\nThe doc said I need to take these everday\nBut I'd rather ride around in a chevorlet\nI don't wanna pray, I don't wanna meditate\nI broke up with my girlfriend yesterday\nIf I wanted to, I can do anything\nI could rap a verse, but I think I'd rather sing\nEverything comes around like a boomerang\nBoomerang, rang, boomerang, rang, rang\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro 8X: B.o.B]\nI try to hold on, on to everything\nSweet memories, but that was yesterday\n\n[Break] - repeat 2X over the end of the outro", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43ec171838184bac0a8baa89f9e6d0a9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
