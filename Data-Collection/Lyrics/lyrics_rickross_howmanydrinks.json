(oh yeah)\nYeah you look good, and I got money\nBut I don't wanna waste my time (come wit' me baby)\nBack of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)\nYou look good; we came to party\nBut I don't wanna waste my time\n\n[Vamp 2: Miguel]\nNo-no-no. I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nWhat? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nI ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nWhat?
