for everybody (Yeah)\nUh\n\n[Verse 1]:\nChampagne dreams for them days I was unemployed (uh)\nSelling drugs, trying to live, I was stuck in void (yeah)\nWasn't like I wanted to\nBut what the fuck I'm 'posed to do\nWhen the government ain't giving me no fucking choice?\nThey ain't want to show us love like them other boys\nI was trying to make a change 'til they cut my voice\nI was trying to buy a Range 'til they upped the price on me\nTry to cut the lights on me like they clubbing boy (Boy)\nI can tell ya things, that some people never seen in life\nLiving lavish, thinks that happiness the key to life\nI had a couple bad bitches, I ain't treat 'em right\nI had a couple fat bitches I ain't even like\nBut their conversations was enough to make me sleep at night\nNever fucked 'em, but I made sure they were eating right\nOnly loved 'em 'cause they taught me how to love myself\nGave me something to believe when there was nothing else\nTell me something else\nAll I know is hell, point me to the riches\nIt's funny how niggas screaming, money over bitches\nBut, when them niggas going broke, then it's bitches over money now, oh\nWhoa, that's some fake shit, but that's the world that I know\nShe just want attention, that's the girl that I know (yeah)\nI just want a pension, that's a check that I deserve\nShare it with my niggas, I ain't stressin' 'bout a bird\nAll you ever wanted in life was to be a legend\nAll I ever wanted in life was to be accepted (uh)\nAll I ever wanted at night was a Lamborghini\n'Til I woke from my dreams, and they told me to keep dreamin'\nMy radio demons\nToo much new shit with out a reason (yeah)\nToo much music without a meaning (yeah)\nBut how the hell do I keep believing without achieving\nAnd how the hell do I pledge allegiance without allegiance?\nMe and John Lennon by the fire, singing songs\n\"Kumbaya,\" wishing that my Lord sing along\nReminiscing 'bout every nigga that did me wrong\nPray to God I don't catch 'em slipping, but this is wrong\nThis is wrong\nWe ain't supposed to hold grudges\nForgiven all my enemies for they don't know nothing\nThis is Sunday school church, this is soul touching\nThis that old Keisha Cole back in '07\nThis that Bob Marley dreadlock shit\nThis that grandma in the kitchen cooking ham hog shit, whoa!\nI warned niggas years ago before they cared about me\nLike \"If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.\"\nBut I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching\nAnd I still got champagne for everybody\nPour it\nChampagne for everybody (yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]:\nShe said\nShe said \"I thought that you were different\"\n\"I thought that you'd be different\" (you'd be different)\n'I thought that you would be submissive' (nah)\nTold you all my secrets while you just pretend to listen\nJust so you can have a feast while you fuck me in the kitchen\nMan, you cold blooded and maybe other hoes love it\nBut I ain't other hoes my nigga I'm so subborn\nThem fucking with my heart is like touching a cold oven\nThat shit barely work, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt\nHold up\nClose my eyes and I never get lost again\nSome niggas cross the line and I never get crossed again\nPigs pulling triggers, these kids won't walk again\nAnd that's the day I promised God that I'd never eat pork again, wait\nNo money, no commas, always had them problems (I wish)\nMore money, more problems, wish I had them problems (I wish)\nI know that finance you stressing had you at the bottom but at least if you was making dollars, you can have some progress\nThey told me only time could tell, but I had no options\nEviction notice, I ain't had no options\nYoung Jeezy bumping, I was on my Tamadotchi\n'Til I almost seen the ghost, I was Action Bronson\nI just wanted champagne while I crack a lobster\nI just wanna see your fucking hands at the concerts\nI just wanna see Meghan Good without the nose job\nI just wanna see Eva Mendes without the clothes on\nAnd so long to my old kins, and my old friends\nAnd so long to my old bitch and her hoe friends\nShout out to all them hypocritical Christians\nWho act like just because I use the words 'niggas' and 'bitches' I can't deliver my message\nCome deliver my blessings\nUpon evil hide your sins , up in witness protection and\nI warned niggas years ago before they cared about me\nLike 'If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.'\nBut I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching\nAnd I still got champagne for everybody\nPour it\nChapagne for everybody\nThere you go\n\n[Interlude]:\nCan I have everybody's attention, please?\nI need to make a toast\nA toast to every motherfucker that ever did me wrong\nA toast to the basic hoes that played me\nAnd the fuck niggas that slayed me\nA toast to the non-believers and the money-hungry creatures who was sitting down eating steaks and lobsters, crabs and didn't even offer me a fucking biscuit with the butter that they give you at the restaurant when you sit at the table\nI've been hungry since the days I was able to use music as an escape when my aunt was on Section 8 and got her first apartment\nI wanna make a toast to my unborn child, I can't wait to see you smile when you come out\nA toast to all my old friends who backstabbed me and spread dirt on my name\nWell, I got plenty champagne for y'all\nHeh, I got plenty champagne for everybody\nI got champagne for everybody!\n\n[Outro]:\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne 'fore we all go\nChampagne, champagne\n(repeat to fade)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/878e845295c819856874c2de04d464e7.794x794x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
