Every second I gotta be goin' in\nA part of me wanna chill, but part of me wanna win\nNo college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel\nCause haters be lookin' stupid, when you just keepin' it real\nI got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit\nBut the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am\nJust because they random dudes I went to school with\nI'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddah smoke\nI always do it big like a Jewish nose\nCadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those\nFuck stress, everything'll be okay\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did you know\nI was feeling so under the weather\nThis evening\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\nAnd they say they love you, but they kiddin'\nThey say they bought your CD, but they didn't\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nDo you believe in fairytales, dreams come true?\nOne day you gone make it\nIf they gave you hand out, and you were down bad\nWould you take it?\nI found that bein' famous in reality, well it ain\u2019t shit\nCause you could have the world in the palm of your hand\nBut it don\u2019t mean a thing \u2018til you change it\nListen, baby, I'mma be great now\nWe can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late\nI\u2019mma make my way to the top, every day I get closer\nWhen I was young they told me to wait until I'm older\nThey turned a cold shoulder to me\nAnd now they want tickets to my shows for the free\n\"Hey Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?\"\nBitch suck my dick\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did you know\nI was feeling so under the weather\nThis evening\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\nAnd they say they love you, but they kiddin'\nThey say they bought your CD, but they didn't\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\n\n[Bridge]\nGo front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi if I'm riding by\nI know it sucks with a 9 to 5\nBut everything'll be alright\nWe go front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi if I'm riding by\nI know it sucks with a 9 to 5\nBut everything'll be alright\n\nUnder the weather, shit'll get better\nUnder the weather, shit'll get better\nThe hatin' gonna last forever so\nI just smile, it's whatever\nUnder the weather, shit'll get better\nUnder the weather, shit'll get better\nDon't let nobody say you can't, heart beating like an 808\nI know it sucks with a 9 to 5, but everything'll be alright\n\n[Bridge]\nGo front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi if I'm riding by\nI know it sucks with a 9 to 5\nBut everything'll be alright\nWe go front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi if I'm riding by\nI know it sucks with a 9 to 5\nBut everything'll be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nHow did you know\nI was feeling so under the weather\nThis evening\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\nAnd they say they love you, but they kiddin'\nThey say they bought your CD, but they didn't\nIf you don\u2019t mind\nCome rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/83b5cf07c39eb95618f6cf76b5552b11.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
