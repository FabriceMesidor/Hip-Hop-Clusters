Got that ghetto blood in my vein\nSpread it through my kin, confess my sins, and blame\nSociety for unawareness, fuck the president\nHe don\u2019t represent the ghetto resident\nRecognize\ufeff fool within the black coal there\u2019s a jewel\nThe revolution been in effect, pull up your shoe\nUtilize your third eye it be in my eye\nNow I choose who gotta die - him, every time\nTicallion stallion now hold on\nLike black diamonds, stud medallions, and so on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe6629f7a5e6af0aa38ca87547ced96f.1000x562x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
