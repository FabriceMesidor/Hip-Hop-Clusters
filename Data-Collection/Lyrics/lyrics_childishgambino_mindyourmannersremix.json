Please and sorry\nYou lucky that I'm Randy, Aziz Ansari\nSo now I'm in the club telling strippers they should back it up\nI wanna hang with Lil Wayne, I just hope that I'm black enough\nDamn, I guess we're all friends here\nExcept for I don't know you, like you was me last year\nIt's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends\nI wanna fuck these small girls, minus \"sm\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't going nowhere somebody better tell a hater\nHe's goin' down like my living room elevator\nFuck what you heard, bitch I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out\nAnd make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out\nPut your fucking boots on it's time to kick the lames out\nYou got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out\nWatch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her\nGirls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber\nPussy thrown at me, you fucking with a wide receiver\nI'm a genius, and I don't need to hide it either\nGot a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight\nMixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite\nBaby girl, shorty, have it however you want it\nWhatever you asking bout, I promise you that I done it\nMy swagger's New York but my home is the South\nAnd it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a9c598da4e86fefcb845cbbe74706aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
