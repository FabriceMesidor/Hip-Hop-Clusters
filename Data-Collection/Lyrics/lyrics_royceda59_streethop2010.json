You might have something\nIf I go over your head, it's cause your ass ducking\nFuck the underground, I rhyme\nFor them fly mothafuckas that's up, that ain't tryna dumb it down\nFuck radio, fuck video\nI live by the Bust' Scenario, what the dealio?\nYou could stop listening, right now\nI'm pussy eating with bitches, I put the dyke down\nCause I'm a diamond, I'm llama rhyming, you Ramadan-in'\nSimon says that in my prime I'm here\nEverywhere I go it's a crime there\nWhile you on-looking at me in the lawn chair\nCocaine, propane\nI'm a living degenerate of the dope game\nRelate to it, though you thought you probably couldn't\nPut a face to the opposite of how the fake do it\nI'm hip hop's savior, the old faithful\nSick shit, stop you off that liquid like brake fluid, this is Street Hop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13187be577e518c77f5c6ac278ec366a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
