(I want to make it better)\nCan I ease the pain that they are goin' through? (they're through)\nWhat can I do?\nWhat can I do?\n\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nI say goodbye to you cruel world, I see peace in the red sky\nI see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head\u2019s high\nHear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly\nFelt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried\nThe turn of the table, the tale of the tape\nThe destruction of human flesh of the not so great\nThe long list of the John Doe\u2019s that accompany the spirit\nAs the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it\nThe resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room\nMuffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I\u2019m cool, I\u2019m cool\n\n(Kelly Price)\nDo you hear me?\nI'm cryin'\n\n[Hook: Kelly Price]\nDo you hear them, crying? (x2 to fade)\nWaiting for someone to come and dry their tears\n(someone to dry their tears)\nTake away their fears (take away their fears)\nCan I make it, better? (gonna make it better)\nCan I ease the pain that they are goin' through?\n(everything they're goin' through) What can I do?\nWhat can I do?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5eb25741266e087e51cc814bb4a051e9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
