CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nA white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber\n\nAll the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end\n\nA chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is\n\nHe holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo\n\nThe Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off\n\nThe Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: How was camp?\n\nThe Boy \"shrugs\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: No\n\nThe father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Frito pie\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie\n\nSilence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window\n\nEXT. MANSION - DAY\n\nThe Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic\n\nINT. MANSION - DAY\n\nAn infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care\n\nThe Father's phone rings:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: Hello\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-\n\nFather hangs up. His cell phone goes off\n\nThe Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out\n\nINT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY\n\nThe Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice\n\nThe Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics\n\nHe starts checking his mail. His friend \"FAM\" sent him something that says \"this is you\" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video\n\nHe goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as \"VERY HOTTTTTTT\". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying\n\n\"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]\" is the top comment\n\nThe Boy stares. Then types \"fuck u niggers\" in the comments\n\nHe waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart\n\nHe refreshes the page. People immediately respond with \"Fuck U\", \"You wouldn't say that to my face faggot\", and \"LMFAO crackers b crazy\"\n\nThe Boy smiles\n...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER*******[PLAY SONG \"CRAWL\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\nINT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nThe room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer\n\nThere is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has \"hackz\" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk\n\nThere's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz \"Demon Days\" poster, and a \"Black Dynamite\" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors \"You Are My Starship\" is the album on top of the others\n\nLittle hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right\n\nThe Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nThe Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nThe kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate\n\nEXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING\n\nThe Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background\nThe boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: when u wanna paddle out? [PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Boy texts back: pick me up\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING\nAn old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Let's take one of yours\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Nah\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?\n\n\"...why do you even care?\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Aight\n\nINT. GARAGE - MORNING\n\nThe garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM (pointing to the car no one's ever seen): That one-\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: No\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: The Bimmer\n\nWe didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Nah...nah\n\nThey get in the 911\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY\n\nThe 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?\n\nFam honks more\nThe Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name \"You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar\" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights\nHe was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...\n...someone tweeted \"roscoe's wetsuit\"\n\n\"...what's that?\"\n\nThe Boy drops \"roscoe's wetsuit\" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to \"what is roscoe's wetsuit?\" is...\"roscoe's wetsuit\". Hilarious\n\nSWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: You guys take your car\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0STEVE: What about your boards?

I know that shit\n\nSwank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: What's \"roscoe's wetsuit\" mean?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: I don't know\n\nThey drive off\n\nEXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY\n\nThe guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them\n\nThey setup camp and start changing on the beach\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I asked every girl\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: You a lie.

Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me\n\nA plane flies low overhead.
