Jean...\n\n[Verse One: Jean Grae]\nAlright, underground climb up, this a new line up\nNiggas fight your way through\nIf you're not ready to lose, may I suggest that you let us the fuck through\nEverybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down\nDance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know\nHands in the air, knees in, knees out\nDrop a little cymbal on them this time, no doubt\nLet's go\nAlright, ten years deep and my tenure's still deep\nMy bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat\nI meant that a decade's almost passed since Baseball was released\nAnd I'm struggling still hustling to eat\nI must be built with adamantium skin\nWhile y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in\nWith your heart poking through on your arm stupid\nDrop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed\nMy mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin'\nDidn't mean to get loud, no disrepect\nBut you know the Jean is a threat to your checks\nNiggas heart burning no prowl no sec to stop the attack\nYa neck back's gettin hot on every drop on the track\nAnd now I finally got some hate it's good, let it be known\nI'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone\nCan't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya\nTo quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up\n\n[Hook]\nWhere you gonna run\nWhere you gonna run\nWhere you gonna ruuuuuun\nWhere you gonna ruuuuuun\nWhere you gonna hide\nWhere you gonna ruuuuuun\nWhere you gonna ruuuuuun\n(Kweli)\nYeah come on, yeah come on\n\n[Verse Two: Talib Kweli]\nWatch these niggas start to run soon as I hit the track\nWhat get the sack, eyes low like Friskin' cat\nMy flow get cap throw they gun like official Nas\nI'm draftin you niggas hard quick fast like tiptonat\nDiamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass\nYour mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash\nScreaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay\nNiggas rappin black and white, I rap in shades of Jean Grae\nSick of niggas licking boots I pick and choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot\nLet the pride and move the cattle\nY'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal\nYou baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me\nMe? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey\nLike magazines telling lies and starting wars like Dick Chaney\nIt sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters\nWhen I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Jean Grae]\nShe lacks delivery - really, nigga?\nI pack rap symmetry and send it to ya dorm\nWhy y'all iggin' me for sure\nJean is synonymous to chivalry\nOpen doors but I step through first\nTest the waters and I pee in them got no network\nBut now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead\nOnly lead I strapped with a razor sharp pencil\nThat could write but it could stab you rapid\nIt's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors\nWhat tho?, come on let's race to where the cash is\nGet mauled like Roy the alter boy\nI'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed\nYou still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level\nYou face screwed ugly\nI'm chasing all you club bunnies\nAnd racing you tackle you down\nTake your money with your chest on the ground\nI know it's foul, what you gonna do now\n\n[Hook]\n\n(I think it's time you gave it up!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cbfcd6a620fb2422b1cc731af78e5d9.946x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
