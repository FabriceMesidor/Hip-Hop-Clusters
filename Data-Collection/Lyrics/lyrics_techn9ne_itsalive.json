Like this\nKansas City, wake up\nYo, like this\n\n[Verse 1]\nOne, and then comes the two to the three and four\nTwo-thousand Tecca Nina is hardcore with a K\nSee me step up on the track like a thug\nMake it pound at Westend then make a dub\nTo the homies in jail, when you making bail\nTime to act an idiot, a lot not just a little bit\nWatch when Kansas City hit, Tech N9ne's gonna spit it\nYou want this record? Cool, go get it\nHot when the flame's lit, Glock where the bane sits\nShock when the pain quits, Pac would've banged this\nInstantaneous when I aim at the miscellaneous\nAsk me ask-ask why-why I'm the strangest\nBecause nobody ever wanted me rappin'\nBut I knew within me I could make it happen\nFlippin' hella different to get it crackin'\nNever bitin' nothin' I was never jackin'\nMillimeter spittin' rippin' up a show\nAnd got the people trippin' everywhere we go\nAnd now we gettin' you to know that misery is comin'\nWe were summoned now the haters runnin' when we gunnin'\nBOW!
