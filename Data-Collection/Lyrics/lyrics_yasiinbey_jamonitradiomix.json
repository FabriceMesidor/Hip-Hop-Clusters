people on the side jam on it {he he, he he, right}\nSo jam on it, say what\n\n(Mos Def)\nThe sweet old beats my speech radiates\nI grab the mic my voice resonates and penetrates\nI make the 'B-Boy' emulate\nA buck-fifty still swinging like a heavyweight\nMe and the lounge about to levitate\nYou don't believe let me demonstrate\nThe way we make cats disintegrate\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell hold up you got to stop the tape\nYou got to prove you can rock the break\nMe and my man going to investigate\nThe whole way that you operate, cooperate\nAnd what's your name? {Mos Def}\nAnd where you from? {Brooklyn}\nAnd how you living {Very well, very well}\nDamn you had to say it twice? {That's right}\nSo you nice? {Damn right}\n\n(Mos Def)\nI rock the party all night all night\n{All right, all right}\nSo why you over here riffing with me?\nTrying to prove your position to me?\n{Some cats ain't equipped to MC}\nBut you can see I'm different 'G'\nThe universal magnificently\nI rock the party efficiently\nFrom the Brooklyn vicinit-y\nAnd I do it so lyrically\nThat you got to give it to me\nLike Rick James, I kick game and spit flames\nBurning rappers all up out their frame\nWe get into this vein\nFrom Brownsville all the way down to Brisbane\n{Damn this brother's flow is insane}\nThat's what I've been trying to explain\nGot no time to play games\nKeep it coming like the next train\nMake the party people exclaim\nWhenever they hear my name\nThey go 'Mos Def'\nOh yes my style is so fresh\nGuaranteed to win any MC contest\nOld school like the '84 fresh fest\nYou spend your assets to get my cassette\nNow that's fresh, the red hook address\nMake the comp jeal and swell like abscess\nI'm shoutin' big love to Medina and the rest\nBout' to drop it on your block the hot on the press\n\n(Chorus with singing in background)\nI said people in the front jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people in the back jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people on the side jam on it {Ha ha, ha ha}\nJam on it, Ha ha, ha ha\n\nTo all my people in the front jam on it\nTo all my people in the back jam on it\nTo all my people on the side jam on it\nSo jam on it, ha ha, ha ha\n\n(Mos Def)\nYou see my name is Mos Def and my style will never pest\nBrown skinned body-rocking MC\nI got the black zodiac and you know it's never whack\nSagitarius definatley\nYou see it's me and lyricist and we're getting serious about to\nMake another hit\nI tell your homeboy chill cuz' his style ain't ill but it's\nStraight up counterfeit\nYou see I'm faster then a speeding bullet and when I'm on\nThe set\nAll the hip-hop fans just raise they hands 'cause I'm the one and\nOnly mighty Mos Def\nYou see I come into the party in a 'B-Boy' stance I rock the mic\nSo viciously\nSo all the real 'B-boys' and real 'B-Girls' know it's no other\nBetter than me\n\n(Cosmo)\nI said hey Mos Def you can't steal the show\nYou ain't the only MC out here with flow\nI'm the Pro Cosmo and I'm letting you know\nThat I get on the mic and go toe to toe\n\n(Mos Def)\nWell cool down young brother just slow your roll\nCuz' your arm's to shook to have mic control\nSee I get on the mic and jump on your case\nYou best get out my face and stay in a child's place\n\n(Cosmo)\nSee I get on the mic because I know I can\nAnd I'm fresher than you because I know I am\nSo when I jump on the stage you better step back\n'Cause your name is Mos Def but your really Mos Whack\n\n(Mos Def)\nUh listen up little brother you ain't grown\nThe sun is going down you need to take your butt home\nYou come outside with your whack freestylin'\nShould have kept it 'In the House' like Debbie Allen\nWhen I grab the microphone people scream my name\nThe ain't no Sesame Street this is a grown-man's lane\nSee you best heed my words and listen up\nOr I'm a tell your momma to whip your butt\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell you ain't my daddy and I'm letting you know\nThat you can't tell me when it's time to go\nSee I get on the mic and show you what it's about\nCuz' even my momma said knock you out\n\n(Mos Def)\nWell if you didn't know baby boy I'm a tell ya'\nYou need to learn to respect your elders\nBut since you here and you think you got skill\nThen get on the mic and show your real\n\n(Cosmo)\nWell I'm the devastatin' never fakin'\nAlways keep the party shakin'\nSteady rockin' never stoppin'\nKeep the party people jockin'\nRock the beat, shock the beat\nTill' it's time to stop the beat\nSteady moving showin' provin'\nKeep the party people groovin'\n\n(Mos Def)\nWell hey young blood that was fresh\nYou just got one hundred on your MC test\nYou got a soul-shocking body-rocking sound you see\nYou need to pack up your bags and get down with me\n\n(Chorus with singing in backround)\nSo jam on it, so jam on it\nI said jam j-jam j-jam on it\nI said were rocking to the bright early morning\nI said jam j-jam j-jam on it\n\nThis is the one to keep inside the jam\nAnd make you get up and just do that dance\nThis is the one to keep inside the jam\nAnd make you get up and just clap your hands\nNew York you got to jam on it\nAnd Atlanta got to jam on it\nAnd VA you got to jam on it\nAnd DC you got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, you got to jam on it\nAnd Miami you got to jam on it\nAnd California you got to jam on it\nBay Area got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, got to jam on it\nChicago got to jam on it\nAnd Detroit cuz' they got to jam on it\nAnd St. Louis got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, got to jam on it\nThe whole world you got to jam on it\nAnd Brooklyn yes we got to jam on it\nThe 'Lyricist' just to make you jam on it\nMake you jam on it, make you jam on it\n\n{And don't you hear the sound...}\n{Mos Def and Lyricist Lounge...}", "image":
