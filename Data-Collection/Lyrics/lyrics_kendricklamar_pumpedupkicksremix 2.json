Bully!\n\n[Verse 1: Mark Foster]\nRobert's got a quick hand\nHe'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan\nHe's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid\nYeah, he found a six shooter gun\nIn his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things, and I don't even know what\nBut he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you\n\n[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)\nAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun\nAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nRun boy\nAre you ready\n(Kendrick)\nDo I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em\nThat I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind\nThen I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine\nI'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock\nClimb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine!\nExplode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me\nEverybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat\n\n[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)\nAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun\nAll the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet\n\n[Hook] (x4)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
