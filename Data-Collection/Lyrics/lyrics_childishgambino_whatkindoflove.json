It's just gonna die\nEverything you love's just gonna leave you one day\nAnd that's just real shit he can still spit\nBut what's the point?\nI said a lot of stupid stuff\nI think that I was growin' up\n\n[Outro]\nWhat kind of love don't hurt so bad?\nWhat kind of love don't feel this way?\nWhat kind of love would make me fold?\nLittle lies, little lies\nLittle lies, little lies\nLittle lies, little lies\nNa, na-na, na, na-na, na-na\nLittle lies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d74ed076bcd8017cb22a7ec0e493ad9.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
