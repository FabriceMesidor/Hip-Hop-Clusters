(faded, I'm stayin' in...)\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Part IV]\n\n[Verse]\nI got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em\n'Cause they remind me of seein' her\nThese the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated\nAnd I buy nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec\n(And I buy nothin' by myself)\nMy hands, I start to cry when I see 'em\n'Cause they remind me of seein' her\nThese the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated\nAnd I buy nothin' but myself, my second thoughts\nMy hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think\nI know Nak in there sleepin', he on the couch, that's my brother\nGive me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him\nTo tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'\nTo tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here\nI'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'\nTo tell the truth, I miss my partna dem\nTo tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam\nTo tell the truth, I'm at a loss of friends\nWell time waits for no man and death waits with cold hands\nI'm the youngest old man that you know\nIf ya soul intact, let me know\n\n[Part V]\n\n[Instrumental]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/83431c40f98b8224af3dd53fce2958d1.300x300x1.png"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
