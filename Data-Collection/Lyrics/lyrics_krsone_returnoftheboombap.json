[x4]\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople always callin me a top celebrity\nCause when I'm on the mic\nI like to speak freely\nYou hear me chattin' lyric but Im not an MC\nA one poetic member of the crew B.D.P\nI looked around the nation but I simply couldn't find\nAnother entertainer with a rhyme like mine\nI pick up the mic and I tear up the phone\nAt this point in the party I should be left alone\nBut uh-oh uh-oh I've come to show\nA brand new flow, is the flow wack? NO!\nListen to the pro, come to the show in a b-boy stance\nBogle in the dance\nBogle and a bogle and a bogle in the party\nHere's a little stylee, come an wake up everybody\nBoom bap original rap\nBoom bap, boom bap original rap\nRefreshin' when you hear it hard rap is all that so\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBogle in the dance, bogle in the dance\nBogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party\nBogle in the dance, bogle in the dance\nBogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party\nOn and on to the PM Dawn\nI buck two shots and you squad is gone\nYou add a little street in your r-a-p\nBut never do you wanna challenge B.D.P\nCause smashin' up a crew, one-two is the least\nWhen a sucka wants to battle that just gets me geesed\nI never backed down from to an MC feud\nNever on stage KRS got booed\nStayed hardcore never changed my attitude\nI got the hip-hop juice for the hip-hop food\nI eat when I drink, an I drink when I eat\nWhen I speak, what I speak, what I speak is not weak\nNow Boogie-down, boogie down, boogie down produc\nWith the buck buck buck buck buck buck BUCK!\nThrow ya hands high in the sky\nWave em around, cause I get down\nDown to the nitty, to the nitty, to the gritty\nPeace to all the hardcore kids in the city so\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nFresh for 1993 you S U C K A S", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2573d3afb044969d03669dee90d609f7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
