I don't got none\nI'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats\nYou know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga\n\n[Interlude: Lil Wayne]\nHaha, I know that's right\nHello world, yeah\nYeah, uh-huh, Music to Fly To coming soon, y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nYou can see me on the Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch\nFuck the world, make it walk with a leg twitch\nFlow retarded, I'm on some Special Ed. shit\nThe magnificent, twist it like a dread, bitch\nAnd I can get up in the car and drive\nAnd if the record is a smash, I can still survive\nYeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me\nShit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me\nYeah, higher than all of the angels be\nAnd, no I never choke but I strangle beats\nAnd, I am just a player in this game we be\nSo go blame the referee, don't complain to me\nAnd I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet\nPassin' all day up Latoya's Street\nBack when Scarface used to sing to me\nHad me feeling like a G was the thing to be\nBack when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike\nWho knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white\nBig dog through the yard where the little dogs bite\nSo if you are female dog, you don't fight\nBitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master\nRich ass nigga, I got all my masters\nBitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master\nRich ass nigga...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/32e1b9a7e336b3f316f0f5de4d6c2815.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
