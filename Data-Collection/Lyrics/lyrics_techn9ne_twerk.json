White dudes be frisking your boo\nCall girl by the night is what she fixin to do\nHomie, re-evaluate it cause your woman might be\nBad for brothas like you good for niggas like me\nLook away partna let your lady go to work\nIt's bout to be the first\nSo baby go on and (twerk)\n\n[Hook x2]\nHey shorty what's your name?\nWhat you willin' to do for me to tip that thang\nYou better twerk sum'n (put some weight on it)\nBaby girl ya better work sum'n (dance for me now)\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nDream girl hey stop put some weight on it\nDon't wanna give it to me mama I'ma wait on it\nBaby you worth it\nNot just cause the way you twerk it\nThis urk a jerk it\nGot me feelin' like you're perfect and I'ma try it\nI know you got a man\nI'll be your man on the side and we can find a place to hide out\nHey and if you slide out\nBaby be careful just what you lyin bout nobody can find out\nSex been part of her since the start of her\nMama was a harlot\nAnd she gave it to her daughter and i love it (i love it)\nSo throw that ass at me and ima throw it back like a quarterback\nCause its lookin' sorta fat\nPay for your schoolin' with the lap dance\nAnd after we can advance to somethin'\nDeep you wantin' me to feed the meter\nPull you away for a minute\nFrom that jerk while you work\nAnd lets to the back and close the curtain cause i love the way you\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Snug Brim]\nDamn you lookin' like youcanova\nSo put the lock on me girl i heard that yous a trooper\nWe in the strip club of course i got plenty chalupa\nYou see these stacks on the table ima let them pursue ya\nMy mouth don't say a word you know what i wanna see\nCome place that pretty round brown right in front of me\nNo disrespect but bend over let me lift the skirt\nI'm fittin' to slap some naked ass while i watch it twerk\n\n[Verse 4: Skatterman]\nWe watch work watch it pop watch it jerk\nLeave a couple thousand on the table you can watch it first\nLil niggas have your fun the skatterman is goin to flirt\nStrange lane in the building all the bitches goin' berserk\nAll day shes a service rep at nextel\nBut when she get home to you she got that sex smell\nExhale nigga get your thumb out your butt\nI know it hurts for you to find out your wife is a slut\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/841b4b501f60322f57f634cacc75d92e.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
