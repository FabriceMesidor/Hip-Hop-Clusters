(To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 1]\nAy, treat it\nLike I was coming from Billings on the way to Spokane\nAnd you found me twisted and mangled inside our road van\nLike it's so ugly the paramedics say \"Oh, man!\"\nThere go Tecca N9na with no life but more fans\nLike in hell or I'm in heaven, just fell in from 9-11\nPropelling from high and dove in the concrete\nLike my name was McVeigh and I check the mail and a bomb beeped\nLike having Griselda\u2019s dope and sell it beyond cheap\nLike I was in the mood for set tripping\nFights begin and Rugers get splitting\nLike my life is through and death slips in\nLike there's no air left and my chest stiffens\nLike I'm in the church and I'm preaching\nLoving the way sister look and after service we creeping\nPlay my music like we was in the telly deep asleep\nThen got murdered 'cause her husband was the deacon\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)\nLike having super pneumonia with out taking my z-pack\nLike me off in a C function flamed up with a B hat\nAnd I'm pattin' my pockets yellin' \"Where's my piece at?\"\nLike an ink session getting a snake and the bat tat\nGot a gun and kicked in the face and I ran to the back \"Skat!\"\nThrough the alley under a ladder tripped over a black cat\nFell in the street got hit by a Toyota with a hatchback\nPlay my music let everyone know that I can rhyme\nBut I got shipped to Iraq and I stepped on a land mine\nLike a wild bull let out the cage and it's ram time\nMy job is to be the circus clown but I'm damn blind\nLike I had the cube and I accidentally called pin head\nLike I'm Matisyahu in a room full of skin heads\nPlay my music like I'm permanently in bed\nI'm sure the DJs are with it with him dead\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Eugor god rof efil aggin)\nUnless I left my vest and I catch the magnum\nLike they let Tech rest and toe-tagged him\nAfter the beat him, tied him to the truck and skull dragged 'em\nLike I died of lupus, cancer, leukemia\nEpilepsy, m.s. or sickle-cell anemia\nAll at the same time and the call is a slain N9ne\nCaught by a serial killer with a saw and it's pain time\nGuess it really does pay to get caught with a stray\nThat's what it cost, what you pay in a way that's all for the say\n'Cause when you rapping your ass off\nSkill is their last thought\nRealler than real spill but you get killed and you blast off\nPlay my records like I'm takin' the big ride\nLike a deadly virus killing me inside\nI know you sucker DJs got a lotta pride\nAll jokes aside even though I'm still alive\n\n[Hook]\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\nPlay my music like I died! (To the DJ)\nLike the N9na ain't alive! (Quit the replay)\nLike I took the long ride! (On my D-day)\nLike everybody love my music\nAnd the whole world cried\n\n[Outro]\nPlay my music like I died\nLike the N9na ain't alive\nLike I took the long ride\nLike everybody loved my music\nAnd the whole world cried", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de5c12836aa9b9bbb55356aafbf1fa0a.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
