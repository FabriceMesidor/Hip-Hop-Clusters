Hell, every team they're sending out here has their own personal masseuse. Not masseur, masseuse. But, it doesn't matter! Do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every 48 hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition? Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad & Tobago? But it doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! I tell you it it just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! It just doesn't matter! Even if we win... if we win, ha! Even if we win! Even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to 10 days, even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field, even if every man, woman, and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!\n\n[Verse]\nYeah\nYeah\nUm, um\nJumping out the Camino\nJust left the gas station, smell like Hot Cheetos\nRecording soft-core on her Tivo\nMa, the meatloaf!\nRe-smoke, got a vegan bitch in the Peace Corp\nAll she ever do is ask me what I eat meat for--\nHold up, pause.
