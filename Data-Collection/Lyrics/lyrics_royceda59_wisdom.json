That's impressive\nDo I listen to you at dinner and playback at breakfast?\nHmm, do you know what a classic is?\nDo you know the name of the place where your pastor is?\nDon't you know the rap game is based on sacrilege\nMan, I'm being petty\nDon't you know that war's an ancient acronym that stands for \"We Ain't Ready\"?\nAnd while I'm combing the town I could travel blocks\nFirst place that it all went down was Fraggle Rock, now it's the gavel drop\nBefore I had them hammer handles I had them handles\nCoulda been in the NBA 'stead of rapping had I had them hops\n9-8, I got stung by a dragonfly, draggin' a mop\nSo nowadays, I stay sharp as daggers while I'm stabbing the drop\nI keep a Mini Cooper that always follows behind me\nI call it Tavis Smiley, that's 'cause it's black and small\nI hate your cigarettes, I hate the smell of Black and Milds\nYou hate me that's crazy I hate to tell you we at the top\nI ain't heard a decent bar in months, bruh\nI'm tired of hearing 'bout your stinking cars and all your dumb trucks\nHow you be with stars and how your gun bust\nI'm here to rain on all you deer, young bucks, high and drunk fucks\nWon't feel a thing we gon' make this shit quick and painless\nLifestyle of the rich and gainless\nRight now you standing in the same place every day with a different payment\nExisting in rented space\nIf niggas ain't gonna innovate then the game gon' renovate\nOkay, you got it, great go for a K\nThem thangs on the interstate\nThat's cool, but I choose to not leave the booth till I see pain on the interface\nWhen we pass, our possessions ain't gon' reach the masses\nFuck yo' Audemar, your Patek Philippe, and your glasses\nBitch\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't be out here just giving all this wisdom\nIf niggas don't seem to believe my mission\nCan't see myself sitting inside no prison\nNo need for money I got tunnel vision\nAll I see is me keep on getting richer\nThat's when I got that 20/20 vision\nIf niggas don't seem to believe my mission\nCan't be out here giving 'em all my wisdom", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2627cc5445030d64606928667383564b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
