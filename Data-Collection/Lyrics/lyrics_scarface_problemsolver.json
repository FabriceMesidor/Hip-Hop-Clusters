You broke bitch. Lack of focus get your nose bit\nLight that ass up then I send you\nOn a mission impossible take flight with my pencil\nAs I enlighten you with shit I done been through\nThe complicated I done make it look simple\nWith one squeeze I leave they head with a dimple\nAnd leaky like an old fat bitch on her menstrual\nYou rap style humble I'm still standing\nAs hard as they been making them these days I cans till win\nWhy the fuck you think they call me an OG?\nThe way I handle biz is nothing short of unholy\nI'm ghostly on the block with my top up\nPistol in my lap you shot wrong you gettin' glocked up\n\nIf you wanna problem, Vinnie is a problem\nAnd the problem is that I'm a motherfuckin' disease\nI would never hesitate to pull the pistol out\nI always got the problem solver with me\nMakin' money over here makin' money there\nSeein' places you could never possibly see\nMy crew thick I don't give two shits\nYou can suck my dick you should probably flee\n\nThe knife work nice, all day gentle carver\nAnd I stay on point like a pencil sharpener\nMatter fact, I'm on point like Tibetan archers\nMove weight legislate like extended caucus\nAnd I know how the game should be locked up\nI know all the dope fiends veins will be popped up\nI know that y'all claim to be stocked up\nGun work nice, all your brains will be mopped up\nThis beef rearrange your face like collagen\nCook jums on the same pot my mamma pasta in\nI don't play games I just rock your chin\nYou fuck with cops?
