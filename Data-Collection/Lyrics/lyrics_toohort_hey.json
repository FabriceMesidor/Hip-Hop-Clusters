I wanna fuck with you\nI wanna hold you close and touch you too\nBack then, we ain't have much to do\nBut things change, and now we stuck like glue\nUsed to love him, now you don't trust that dude\nYou with me every day, so it must be true\nIt's the game -- can't be real without it\nIf you choose it, tell me how you feel about it\n\n[Outro: Silk-E]\nI want you in my zone now, baby come see me\nOn my way to the hideout\nWon't you please hold me close\nTake everything but my business just to fuck with you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d13087da8906c2a6a234138aa8f06e21.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
