get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Verse 1: Nelly]\nThey acting like they really want it with me, trust me\nThey don't really want it, they just want to be seen\nThey want to disrupt my team with these publicity schemes\nTrying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals\nBut uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war\nI tell you the situation like I've been here before\nI'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking\nWatching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting\nNo choking or bleeding, this ride is for free, no matter what\nYou got your dying for free, automatically\nI'm focused like thirty five millimetres, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to meet us, all of the sudden\nLike such and such wants to greet us, the same, will you believe us\nNow, they're all trying to cheat us, in real life, they can't beat us\nSometimes, they try to repeat us\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Verse 2: King Jacob]\nWhy is they yacking like they fucking with these, I don't know\nWhy is they stunting like they holding the keys, tell me\nThem type of people don't be holding no heat, no\nThen how the fuck they gon' be rolling with me, yeah\nDude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time\nYour mouth's going to fuck around and going to waste your time, hey\nI told them niggas' that ain't going to grind\nWhen its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty\nI'm the same nigga that's out of control, out of control\nI put a little malinger out on the roll, hey, the bigger it just got\nThe calico, I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah\nSet that aside cause I've got to get those, got to get those\nThe finest shit than what you're proud of me for, tell me\nThe dirty, either you going to ride or you don't, yeah\nInside there's more shit, if not, we're gone, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Bridge]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you tell them, watch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell them\nWatch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now\n\n[Verse 3: Nelly]\nWell, if I said it, I've done it, if I've done it, I did it\nAnd if I, and if I want it, if I don't put it against it\nThe way that I should spend it to get just how I should\nAll money ain't good money but no money ain't good\nI took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents\nTrying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas\nNever matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know\nI'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor\nI'm dotting, just want to be, I ask, clipping the wings\nI want to fly ass, only Q and D Miles can look down on me\nMaybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie\n\n[Hook x2]\nNow if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll\nIf you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door\nI ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me\nWere you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride\nGet inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth\nThen, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time\nTell me, were you the one that's on the grind\nCheck it, was it you that was on the grind dirty\n\n[Bridge]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you tell them, watch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell them\nWatch me now, I'm spiffy now\nSmoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now", "image":
