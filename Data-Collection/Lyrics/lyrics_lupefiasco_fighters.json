Is it girls? Is it money?\nThe world?\n\n[Verse 1 : Lupe Fiasco]\nOr is it something they can never believe?\nOr is it something you can never achieve?\nIs it beyond your means?\nIs it inside your dreams?\nCan it never come out cause it's scared to\nUnprepared to, too worried about the words of the people it's weird to\nYou don't want them to hear you\nYou just wish there was a door that would appear\nThat you can go disappear through\nWell I'm feeling your pain\nI was feeling the same\nBut I said I'd never feel that again\n\n[Hook: Matthew Santos]\nWhen the fighters are all around\nAll the lovers are on the ground\nNo one will save you anymore\nSo what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?\nIs it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?\nThe world?\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nMan, I really miss my pops\nHope that God watches over him and that he's on top\nThat there is no more disease and that he's alright\nThat he's one of the generals inside the army of the light\nAnd grandma, you know I had to bite something from you\nSo after every show it's \"peace, and much love to you\"\nAuntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl\nI know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world\n\n[Hook: Matthew Santos]\nWhen the fighters are all around\nAll the lovers are on the ground\nNo one will save you anymore\nSo what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?\nIs it cars? Is it girls?
