mo power, mo motherfucking respect I tell ya\nFocus mo on cowards the world don't stand a projected failure\nSeek Absolute Power, perfect and conquer the world with it\nUse at yo discretion, but knowingly at yo own risk\nThese times are strange\nBut use time to gain in my mind frame\nI strive for change but I'll die for change when the time came\nYou betta tell 'em Tech N9ne millennium big
