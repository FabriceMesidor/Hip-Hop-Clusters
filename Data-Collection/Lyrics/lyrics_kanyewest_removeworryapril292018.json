I know there will be harmony\n\nenergy is contagious\n\nArt is the threat to authority\n\nArt is the escape hatch from oppression\n\nwhat makes kids so important to learn from psychologically is that they are not afraid to fail\n\nWhat would you do today if you are not afraid of the consequences of failure?\n\nWe\u2019re all kids\n\nor at least we're dying to be kids\n\nOr we\u2019re dying because we've lost our inner child\n\nwe're dying to be ourselves\n\nwe\u2019re in this so-called information age but we're starving for wisdom\n\nwe're being starved and anyone who starts asking unpopular questions gets demonized. Only free thinkers can change the world\n\nThere's a silent majority of people that have been silenced for too long", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
