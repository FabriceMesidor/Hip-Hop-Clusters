Blessed is he, who in the name\nOf\nCharity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of\nDarkness\nFor he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children\nAnd\nI will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger\nThose\nWho attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. AND YOU WILL KNOW MY\nNAME IS\nTHE LORD, WHEN I LAY MY VENGEANCE UPON THEE!\"\n\n[Shots fired]\n\nSmokin' MC's like a bowl of Buddha\nBurnin' in my bong now\nYou don't want to step to the rhythm of the funk degrees\nYou'll be a prisoner in the temple of thieves\nMove it out, just move it on out, no doubt\nWe the number one crew\nKickin' more gas niggas out the house\nPuttin' up an argument, just don't bother\n`Cause I'll whoop that ass just like I'm your father\n\nTake heed to the master's call yes y'all\n(Bring yoself fool cause I fade 'em all)\nBullets fly\nBut they don't give a fuck about who dies\nWhen you're in the middle of the fuckin'\nNo question, confrontation\nNowhere to run from the assassination\nLet the rain come down\nWhoops there goes another body on the ground\nWatch out for G hound\nIt's the undisputed Cypress family\nKickin' up dust, can you handle us gradually\nGrowin' inside your mind like a tumour\nSpreading in your head like a rumor\nVenomous!\nI'm from the underground, I take care of business\nWhat the fuck is this?\n\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\n\nSuckas come in all shapes sizes and colors\nLet me get the rope\nAnd hang `em `till their fuckin' necks broke\nWind passage cut off, now you can't breathe\nLet me give you what you need\nA fat dose of the good weed\nLike a puppet on a string\nI'm the one controlling your ass\nWith the rough shit here to bring\nMy army grows like the buddha I sold ya\nEvery seed planted is another fuckin' soldier\nLike the `coup d'etate'\nNow ya are in the middle of the ambush\nStuck in your car\nThey can't find ya\nAt the bottom of the lake\nLet me remind ya\nYou better be lookin' behind ya\nIt's too late, ain't no one standin' here\nHallucination, bees hummin' in your ear\nParanoia, dwelling to your dome piece\nIncrease, the level of the terror that move ceased\n\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\n\nMake a move, make a move, every posse make a move\nMake a move, make a move, every posse make a move\nMake a move, make a move, every posse make a move\nMake a move, make a move, every posse make a move\n\nCome on\nOpen up the doors for the high funk buddha\nWith the light point the dick can die\nRolling with the six shooter\nThirty-eight\nStill shootin' real straight\nLookin' for the buster that I must eliminate\nNo surprise\nAs the inches demise\nLet the four flow\nAs I look him right in the eyes\nAnd rip these niggas in half\nWith the paragraph\nThey can't find a path\nI like the aftermath\nStill I reign the sect we remain\nThe big bad Cypress Hill, fuckin' niggas up again\nWhen I aim I'm scopin' for your brain\nBrother stay low, cross-hairs break you up the frame\n\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out! Move `em out!\nMove `em out! Move `em on out!
