Mission Impossible\nBecause she's the one the hon chose to boast to\nThe way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste\nSo make music in my basement\nDon't cut her off till I find a good replacement\nOne day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's\nHouse, cause the hon was sleeping over\nMy girl was acting fine, then the slime switched\nWanna diss, I said \"It's over, you waste of time bitch\"\nTried to kiss her friend, twice then a third\nShe said \"Stop, Rick\", but didn't tell her friend a word\nI went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently\nSnuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before\nBecause she swore a nigga hit her\n\"Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?\"\nBut I didn't, now the hon badgering\nI don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair\n\n[Bridge]\nGot Rick sitting right here\nWaiting for you my dear\nWondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother brother out for one thing, mistook him for\nSteady relationship is what I'm really looking for\nSincerity, scoop the hon I done it\nI said \"Being straight up, it's you I really wanted\"\nThough she fucked niggas with money like mad\nI still found myself wanting the honey quite bad\nLoyal to her friend, though she wanted wood\nThen we did it, boy that pussy was good\n\"But what if shorty finds out?\" Never be too clever\n\"Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together\"\nChill, then we started to button the strap and\nThen my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened\nLater on, my girlfriend stormed in\n\"We going to the supper club, some kid's performing\nBye, see you later\"\nHer girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow\nI'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can\nBoth sluts were sliding numbers to the next man\nContradicting of words being together\nMy girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather\nBack in my Jeep, about 4:11\nPopped another can, looked up to the heavens\nI'm a good man, in fact I know that I am\nAnd I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm\n\n[Chorus]\nSitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala\n\n[Bridge]\nGot Rick sitting right here\nWaiting for you my dear\nWondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething tells Rick he's a fool\nTo let girls treat me so cruel\nBut never-the-less, Rick said \"You got me waiting\"\nSitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9492e61c778d8d1c0b9cddf2393d4e25.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
