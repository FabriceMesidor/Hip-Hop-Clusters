(Watchin'!)\nOkay, let's do this\n(The watcher!)\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nThings just ain't the same for gangstas\nBut I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters\nAll of these rap singers claimin' they bangers\nDoin' all sorts of twisted shit with their fingers\nDisrespectin' the game, no home training or manners\nI was doin' this shit when you was shittin' your Pampers\nI was movin' them grams\n'Fore you knew what a hand-to-hand was\nDuckin' the vans, radars, the scanners\nBefore you knew what \"hard,\" \"white,\" or \"tan\" was\nI was hittin' the turnpike, aight with the bammers\nI was nice with my hands, cuz aight with them hammers\nI was prickin' my finger 'fore you knew what a \"fam\" was\nI had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was\nThree hundred mil' later, now you understand us\nY'all ain't see us comin' through Vegas\nYou ever seen so much cham' bust in one night\nGrand fucked up one fight, I was on the Peter Pan bus\nYou was puttin' Peter Pan up in your room\nY'all fuckin' with whom?\nAllow me to retort\nYou cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught\nYou niggas ain't know about a Robb Report\n'Bout a high speed Porsche\nI.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss\n'Til I came through the door\nLike Eric B. for Pres, respect me in this bitch!\nYou can't disrespect us, \u2018cause you got a little check cut\nYou was suckin' 'em so long, fuckin' your little neck up\nNow you too big for your britches\nYou got a few little bitches\nYou think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous\nI blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game\nIt's only right I got the right to be king\nNiggas that got life really like what I sing\n\u2018Cause they know it's really like, niggas feel my pain\nKnow the shit I don't write\nBe the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game\nWord to the hyphen in my name!\nJ-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa\nThe past, present, nigga the future, proper\nThe holy trinity of hip-hop is us\nWe give Dre his props, but that's where it stops\nIt's the Roc!\n\n[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nBut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\nEverywhere that I go ain't the same as before\nPeople I used to know just don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go, I got people I know\nWho got people they know, so I suggest you lay low\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nI'm still on top of the game\nStill droppin' flames, still cock and aim\nStill at the top, had to rock for the fame\nOver setbacks, there's been a lot since I came\nYou seen it all, how I got, how I gained\nThe momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain\nWhen I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim\nThe streets; they made a special spot for my name\nDre, haters wanna stop to my reign\nBut the music lives in me, every drop in my veins\nThe pride and the pain\nAll the way back from the rise of my name\nSee the world clear through the eyes of the man\nSee the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave\nWhen the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane\nThe odds that I played\nThe best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher\n\n[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nBut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\nEverywhere that I go ain't the same as before\nPeople I used to know just don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go, I got people I know\nWho got people they know, so I suggest you lay low\n\n[Verse 3: Rakim]\nI'm Rated R, my brain contains graphic things\nIt turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends\nIt's like watchin' a movie through a panoramic screen\nWhich means, I can see the whole planet in the scene\nCash is the topic; the object? A fatter pocket\nSome take the crack and chop it\nBut those that haven't got it take away to add a profit\nIt's catastrophic, I take the gat and cock it\nAnd I'll sit back and watch it\nThese New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully\nThe world is mine, and can't nobody keep it from me\nYo, my neighborhood is never sunny\nIn the place where the number-one cause of death is money\nYou can try copin'\nI've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken\nI'm still alive and scopin'\nBe 'nother hundred years 'til my skies close in\nAnd I'ma die with my eyes open: The Watcher!\n\n[Chorus: Truth Hurts & Terri]\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nVut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\nEverywhere that I go ain't the same as before\nPeople I used to know just don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go, I got people I know\nWho got people they know, so I suggest you lay low", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bbaaa25ac55d3bc2008448e1647d3b54.720x631x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
