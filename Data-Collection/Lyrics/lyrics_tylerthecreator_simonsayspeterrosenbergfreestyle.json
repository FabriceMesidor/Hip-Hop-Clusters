Sam I Am\nWith the green eggs and ham, nigga I'm crazy\nCome through, listening to some old-school Jay-Z\nIn a bucket\nCome through with a bucket on like, \"fuck it\"\nLooking like Fredrick Douglass\nWith the lil' cut in my hair, you don't even know\nI come through, pigeon-toed\nCome through with a different ho\nI don't even know, don't ask questions\nCome through, I don't ask no one for suggestions\nCause I'm depressed\nI come through...\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]\nThey know I'm the best here\nShit get more wavy than my fucking chest hair\nWhat y'all mean?\nY'all niggas fishy like sardines\nOily as fuck, you see the ice on\nMy neck, it's shiny as fuck, like the sun\nJust got buttfucked by a truck with a bunch\nOf lights in it, I fucked your white women\nY'all niggas don't want to do this\nTo me tonight cause I got a knife\nI stab any nigga in his esophagus\nYou don't want no problem, bitch\nOh, you gon' call the police? Well, give me your phone\nI'mma use your anytime minutes, dial my home number\n310, 310, 310\nMom, open the door\nI'mma come in, make a bowl of ravioli\nWalk out, get in a car, drive somewhere else\nYou don't believe me, nigga?\nCome see me, nigga, come D me, nigga\n\n[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]\nWait, I was about to say the alphabet!\nYou wouldn't let me finish!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/610384882ca6311db99de4fbfcdf2b46.421x421x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
