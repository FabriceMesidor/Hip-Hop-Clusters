What I want to do to you... nah, really it's for you, is open my mental window, hoping that you would climb in, or if not, at least look in. I want to take you to places that I have been and to the places that I want to go. I mean this music, it ain't all that I got, but it does mean a lot to me, I injected my whole being into it, and I've been doing it for a while, it's like my whole life has become a style. I want to get into it... yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c13069157cf82b06434a58c5005ed904.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
