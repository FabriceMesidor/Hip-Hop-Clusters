the minute shit was heated, she just bailed\nI'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself\nI couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell\nTurned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt\nSaw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground\nI just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail\nI'm not about to lose my freedom over no female\nI need to slow down\nTry to get my feet on solid ground, so for now\n\n[Chorus]\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n\n[Verse 2]\nBury my face in comic books, \u2018cause I don't wanna look\nAt nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could\nIf I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would\nAnd end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood\nI probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once\n\u2018Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up\nI think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up\nI gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl\nAnd I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good\nI'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud\nMust be in my blood \u2018cause I don't know how I do it\nAll I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps\nOf my dad \u2018cause I hate him so bad\nThe worst fear that I had\nWas growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass\nMan, if you could understand why I am the way that I am\nWhat do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm\n\n[Chorus]\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it\nFor me to have this much appeal like this is sick\nThis is not a game, this fame, in real life, this is sick\n\"Publicity stunt\" my ass, \"conceal\" my fuckin' dick\nFuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats\nIf I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass\nI love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp\nOn the fact I've sacrificed everything I have\nI never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at\nThis is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked\nEverywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask\nWhat about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?\nIt's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt\nI'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped\nI sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back\nI just wanna leave this game with level head intact\nImagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'\nEverything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'\nIt's fuckin' crazy, \u2018cause all I wanted was to give Hailie\nThe life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'\n\n[Chorus]\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n(Hollywood, why do I feel this way?)\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\nSayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood\n\n[Outro]\nGoodbye, goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)\nPlease don't cry for me (It's been real)\nWhen I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)\nSo goodbye, goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fuckin' star)\nPlease don't cry for me (No way)\nWhen I'm gone for good (I'm goin' back home)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c43578375ef2ac32c140cc35dfe2fef1.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
