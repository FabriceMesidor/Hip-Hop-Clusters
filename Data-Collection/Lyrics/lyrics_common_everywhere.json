(x4)\n\n[Verse 1: Martina Topley-Bird]\nA shaman since before my birth\nAnd I came down to rock the Earth\nMy mission condition:\nI give you, you listen\nI'm syncing in time in parallel\nIn binary, no 3rd return\nI'm planning intention\nWith all the redemption\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nNo pop, no pop, no pop, no pop\nWe gon'do this thang till the sky just drop\nLock into ya mind away we rock\nIn a rocket is the 87 astronaut\nTop of the soul, dove and I got in a hole\nAt the moment they were saying, \"It was outta control\"\nStrap in to your mind, why eyes see some recline\nYou'll see in time your season to shine\nWhen the stadium is dark, emcees are defined\nGet ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line\nThe race is on to space beyond\nYou gon' get there by doing what you want\nSometimes the most famous feel all alone\nSo we drift to a place that we call our home\nI was known as being spaced and outta my dome\nNow I know, it's all I've known\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5e77fbc81fc58bc396f33872fc1ec855.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
