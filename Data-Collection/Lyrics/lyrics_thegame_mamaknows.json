Album", "year": "2011-08-19", "lyrics": "[Verse 1 : Game]\nMama told me stay away from them niggas\nMama told me she had a K for them niggas\nMama told me she go today for them niggas\nWhile my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas\nThey just young black and ignorant\nLusting over models and them Benjamins\nGot the game twisted like (what?) licorice\nWhen I was rocking lottos, moving packs up out McDonalds\nShe was looking for me, pulled up in that Old El Dorado\nI was running around with chicks, chasing new black wheels\nWhy would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed\nBut I use that steel, cause I will do that deal\nScrew the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill\nWhat did I learn? Nothing\nMy pops smoking sherm, bluffin'\nBeating on my moms like her head was a percussion\nTat! Tat! My .45 knocking on your window\nShe said there would be days like this\nPharrell, drop the instrumental (Yessir)\n\n[Hook : Nelly Furtado]\nI know I must go and I don't know my way\nStill somehow I know I'll end up where we all came from\n(From my mama's womb)\n\n[Verse 2 : Game]\nSwisher, crack a 5th up\nHennessy pouring like Niagara Falls\nUsed to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball\nMoms working late night, to get our plate right\nHad some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight\nWish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right\nSome niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type\nDidn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky\nWorking on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me\nPick and choose, stick and move\nSo many dudes ended up with sleeping bags on late-night news\nBut not my mama's son, known around the hood for serving customers\nShe yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler\nWhat I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her\nWish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up\nLike \"here hug em ma, one last time\"\nPut a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : Game]\nPut your Glock down, recognize a king cause it's my town\nWord to my mother you can throw up your rock now\nGot off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black\nRight there, crying over hard facts\nNow she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back\nNever! She carried me for 9 months, so she can have whatever\nClever, she taught me how to shoot Berettas\nTold me that I'd be a king, so R.I.P. to Coretta\nIf you don't understand that, then refer to my letter\nWhile I sprinkle niggas with platinum from my last album\nGot the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm\nRiding through the hood, you hating niggas like \"how come\"?\nThat niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum\nEither way, hey playboy, check it, this is the outcome\nYou might not like it, but my mama psychic\nWhy you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f5301fa46a1afd76d0d034e80d23434.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
