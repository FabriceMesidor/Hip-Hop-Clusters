Ooh!\nI flip skins like Mary Lou\nSo what ya gonna do when (Aicha) come for you, boo\nI got girls that look like Toni Braxton\nAnd give me the skins without askin'\nWhen I'm relaxin' on my back and you know what time it is, uh\nBut if it's red man, I'll leave it alone\nShe can call me on my cellular phone\nAnd I mess around and pick you up\nTake you to the crib, stick you up\nPut on my Silk CD and lick you up and down\n'Til you say stop, hit the twat, 'til your pops call the cops\nAnd when I make bail outta jail, I'ma wail on that tail\nBecause the sex never fails\n\n[Hook]\nI am, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm?

I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm?

I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\n\nAll the playaz in '94, recognize\nSomething D full effect, baby, baby\nUh, uh yeah, fuck all you bitches", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97e6c354b8368e36130dd912210fd93d.1000x992x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
