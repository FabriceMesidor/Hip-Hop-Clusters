I know... that they're out to get me\nAnd all those people I call my friends, let it go\nThat's why I never call on y'all, to be around\nCause you see how this money can change everything\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nGeah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur\nKeep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer\nMuhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em\nWatch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket\nI see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit\nThey plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick\nInvested in my niggas, took the realtor route\nGambled on the wrong niggas, had to filter 'em out\nType of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful\nBehind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full\nIt's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it\nThat's why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit\nServe 'em drinks and welcome all to the law\nFor let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off\nI seen it one too many times, your peeps be leaving you speechless\nSometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness\nSee now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me\nCome up out they sheepskin and act all different around me\n\n[Hook]\nThey see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)\nThey so cold... I know... that they're out to get me\nAnd all those people I call my friends, let it go\nThat's why I never call on y'all, to be around\nCause you see how this money can change everything\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nListen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on\nHow niggas steal this funny style and I was struggling broke\nEven though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny\nWhen I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me\nInstead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit\nNiggas was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship\nIn the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel\nI'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's\nAs I get more money, days get colder\nI learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder\nSo then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier\nMoving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder\nLiving by morals and principles mainly\nHaving heavy thoughts to a kill my brother every time them fuckers betray me\nBut now I'm winning with the strength of the nation\nI promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing\nI'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse\nNow when those same \"friends\" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt\n\n[Hook]\nThey see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)\nThey so cold... I know... that they're out to get me\nAnd all those people I call my friends, let it go\nThat's why I never call on y'all, to be around\nCause you see how this money can change everything\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nInstead they getting together with me so we both can get rich\nWhen I'm outta town, these niggas busy tryna fuck with my bitch\nSame niggas spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish\nI hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish\nI said I'm tired of these niggas, that'll owe me so much shit\nThat they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit\nSometime we can't forgive whatever balances off\n'Specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross\nRealized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range\nThe more money niggas get, shit around you will change\nEven though niggas'll flip and say, \"You the one changed\"\nFuck you, they do that just to justify takin your shit from you\nThe more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid\nCause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it\nAnd while I sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom\nIf I never see these \"friends\" again, that shit'll be too soon\nShit is real like every wind in my breath\nAnd that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!\n\n[Hook]\nThey see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)\nThey so cold... I know... that they're out to get me\nAnd all those people I call my friends, let it go\nThat's why I never call on y'all, to be around\nCause you see how this money can change everything", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be78d5f1fcdafddac07407fe6e45d552.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
