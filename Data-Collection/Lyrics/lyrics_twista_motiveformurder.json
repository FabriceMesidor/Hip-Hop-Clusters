papers walking with 3 years parole\nI did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying\nI'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying\nNot to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball\nWhile waiting for this pussy ass job to call\nAnd it ain't hopping\nGot me tipping to hear them things popping\nCash bags dropping\nWith plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking\nIts what I'm on\nI cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone\n24 years and grown with a future unknown\nMy heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game\nBut I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane\nSo its back to pistols and cane\nPlotting on licks hitting stains\nThe mob life runs through my veins\nIts too late for me to change\nThese streets got me deranged\nStrapped up and paranoid\nReady to add on situations I can and can't avoid\nPlus big voices getting hot\nThey constantly sneaking on blocks\nThey trying to bring me in unconscious\nBut them pins got popped\nNow they got me on the run\nCherishing every last breath\nBut I ain't going back\nIts freedom or death\nThat be my motive for murder\n\nBegin*CHORUS*\n\n*Liffy Stokes*\nNow I know you the judge of life and death\nI ain't evil or nothing\nBut somebody done brought me pain and sorrow\nSo I'mma have to kill something\nLet me count the ways that I can repent\nTrying to stay holy and focused\nBut that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus\nThat be my motive for murder\n\n*Twista*\nI'mma survive these streets another day\nI know the pain in my heart won't go away\nThese mother fuckers try to murder me\nAnd won't nobody hurt my family\nThats what he gotta die\n\nEnd*CHORUS*\n\n*Mays*\n9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick\nIf it ain't coming up with the dopest shit\nThen I'm trying to cop the thickest brick\nCause life in the belly of the best\nIs equal to povertys bottomless pit\nWhere bitch niggas trick\nAnd thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get\nBut it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick\nBefore its too late to get straight\nAnd the most I make is final pick\nAnywhere they shit like riding slick\nWith a thick chick slobbing your dick\nEven if it means fighting these niggas in cases\nAs long as neither ones thick\nCause I swear when I get hit\nI go in a crucial rage like a flick\nTurn straight lunatic\nMaking all these bitches niggas hear their final tick\nBut that don't mean my minds sick\nJust cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese\nWhen trees by the p's\nAnd fuckin fine fee's and 3's with ease\nFor sho the skilled poets\nWithin in the mask up kill for it\nI'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill\nI'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it\nBullshit ain't nothing\nI'm trying to get this first mil in the bank\nAnd drive a bullet-proof hummer tank\nSo the next haters who try to air me out come up blank\nAnd I'mma have to sacrifice your life\nWith a wrath thats stronger than christ\nAnd forces of life thats know to do damage to human eyesight\nI guess its true\nMoneys the route of all evil\nCause crooked or legal\nIts all manipulated by the eagle\nAnd be my motive for murder\n\n*CHORUS*\n\n*Twista*\nLord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start\nHow I'mma hide love for this mob\nThis nigga made my homie die in my arms\nHad to put a slug in his heart\nMother fuck that slug\nIt was just a grudge on his part\nMy boy was young and ambitious\nTook his dreams and wishes\nTry to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches\nDrowning all my sorrows in bottles of 'nac\nAnd a quarter ounce of dro on my lap\nI'm bout to snap\nHere come the big pay back\nLooking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap\nI'm crying and shit\nI was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him\nEven if a slug hit him\nI was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him\nCan't control them pains\nNow its time to throw them thangs\nVisions of the stud on sight\nEmpty the clip of air him out right\nAmbulance come around\nBy the time the hypes\nTaking of his nikes\nI know it sound cold\nBut this bullet put a hole in my soul\nLeft his shorties years throwed\nHe was only 17 years old\nAnd at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll\nAnd I know he used to wild sometimes\nCarry a 9 but you took away your sunshine\nNo more reminising on the fun times\nBalling and coming at bitches with blunt lines\nBut this nigga ain't going to want mine\nFor the pain I'mma handle this flunk and dismantle this junk\nFuck all that\nIn all black and then pumped\nTo run up on this nigga\nTip up on him then dump\nMission to kill armed with a fist full of steel\nEyes gleam with the fury\nNever thought I'd be facing to 2 murders\nIn front of a prosecuting team and a jury\nHow did one murder turn into 2\nRevenge had me shooting through hate\nI couldn't stop\nIn the mist of the action\nIs when that little girl got shot\nAll because of my motive for murder\n\n*CHORUS*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eec8e7a6f6a923d6b51bf33b15f0b3b9.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
