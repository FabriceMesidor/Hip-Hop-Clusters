Question 1 - What am I being?\nGREENIE : Y-Y-Y-Y-You a rapper !!!\nKRS-ONE: Wrong! I'm emceeing..\nGREENIE: What's the difference?\nKRS-ONE: Well, it's the unity; The rapper is corporate, the emcee is community\nGREENIE: Community rap?\nKRS-ONE: It's something like that...for emceein'... but the question was...\n'What am I being?\"\nGREENIE: What are you being?\nKRS-ONE: Can anyone answer this? What are you seeing? Can anyone answer Kris?\nGREENIE: When you say \"What are you being?-- Does that mean you're BEING your emceeing?\"\nKRS-ONE: Yes! But what I'm being is hip-hop..THAT'S what's really gettin' respect on your block...\nGREENIE: Hip-Hop !?!?\nKRS-ONE: That's right-- Hip-Hop... Last of the human skills..\nGREENIE: Ahhhh... Hip-Hop..\nKRS-ONE: Let's go further... with this pre-meditated worder...Kris Parker, the teacher-- I know you hearda... All the sciences, makin' instruments out of appliances, showin' you what self-reliance is...\nGREENIE: ...but whose rhyme this is? Why's whack emcees in our face like sinuses? You positive like plus, Kris, and they minuses-- Ideas are going through my mind like a Catscan...I'm not a white emcee who pretends to be a Black man...I was writing rhymes when they invented Pac-Man..now my rhyme'z is tight like that suit on Batman...You kept it real, Kris, you came out as a rosta; I'm comin' out controversial...talkin' 'bout Schvartze....Rappers are whack today...but I don't need to dis' one... My rhyme style is THIS one....", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9fa55af2e8bfddf3b40ea0e0347874f.556x556x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
