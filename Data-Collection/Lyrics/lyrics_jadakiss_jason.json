Yo\nI'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes\nEven niggas is jealous so they just want you to die\nThey don't want you to rise, they just want you demise\nSo I be crossing my T's and I be dotting my I's\nYou on the opposite side, shots gonna fly\nBest part about it, I can stay right up in Yonkers and hide\nKeep a gun in the door, that's all in the ride\n'Til my niggas come home, free all of the guys\nThis shit is all a facade, thought it was all a surprise\nI heard of the stories, seen all of the lies\nLong as the work is official, and the corner supplied\nAt the end of the day niggas, we gonna survive, what?\n\n[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & (Jadakiss)]\n(Don't shoot please, can't breathe\nOfficer don't shoot, can't breathe)\nI got my hoodie and my mask on\nI got my gun and my blast on\n(Don't shoot please, can't breathe\nOfficer don't shoot, can't breathe)\n\n[Verse 3: Jadakiss]\nI'm just one of the five, I'm just one with the vibes\nCan't figure it out or they don't wanna decide\nIn the gutter replying, mic flooded with dimes\nSince you asked, I'ma hit you with the butt of the nine\nBullets soaking in pine, let 'em open your spine\nUse your brain a little, my nigga open your mind\nIf you ain't in the circle, for a square I get you line\nI know niggas is telling, I don't care about the time\nYeah I got weed on me, I don't care about the fine\nFrom a hood where niggas don't give a fuck by design (Y.O.)\nYeah, it's real life, it's not a rhyme\nAnd remember, if you don't get caught it's not a crime, like\n\n[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & (Jadakiss)]\n(Don't shoot please, can't breathe\nOfficer don't shoot, can't breathe)\nI got my hoodie and my mask on\nI got my gun and my blast on\n(Don't shoot please, can't breathe\nOfficer don't shoot, can't breathe)\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/9b83f792e9aab99539b80402ba1ef1eb.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
