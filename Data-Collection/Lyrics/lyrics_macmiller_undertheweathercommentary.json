Can I have an autograph?\nBitch suck my dick\n\nChorus:\nHow did you know I was feeling\nSo under the weather this evening\nIf you don't mind, come rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\nThey say they love you, but they get it\nThey say they bought your CD, but they didn't\nIf you don't mind, come rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\n\nGo front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi from round by\nI know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright\nWe go front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi from round by\nI know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be all right\nUnder the weather shit'll get better\nUnder the weather shit'll get better\nThe hate ain't gonna last forever, so I just smile, it's whatever\nUnder the weather shit'll get better\nUnder the weather shit'll get better\nDon't let anybody say you can't, heart beatin like the 808\nGo front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi from round by\nI know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright\nBut everything will be all right!\nWe go front, back, side to side\nWave, say hi from round by\nI know it sucks with it 9 to 5, but everything will be alright\n\nChorus:\nHow did you know I was feeling\nSo under the weather this evening\nIf you don't mind, come rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay\nThey say they love you, but they get it\nThey say they bought your CD, but they didn't\nIf you don't mind, come rest your mind\nI think it's all gon' be okay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
