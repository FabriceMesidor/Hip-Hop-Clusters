I got a three piece\nA MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE\nHe backpedaling like a DB\nI'm such a Martian\nCall me ET\nAlways behind it like I own the TP\nI shit, fart, pee pee\nOn anybody track\nWalk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax\nWassup\nNow phone home\nMy nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down\n\n[Verse 2: Punch]\nYour boy carry that flame I am a arsonist\nI spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage\nIll wip, drive by, niggas carsick\n20 on the charm\nVVS studded flawless\nTry and reach we specialize in garbage\nTaking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits\nHow many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond\nI wail on niggas I'm vicious\nNo, I'm serious\nSkip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean\nYou niggas ain't listening\nI'm not from 'round these parts\nI'm nonexistent\nHit you with brake light\nLeave you missing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b626036c563b0aefa7a5b83f1fb9302.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
