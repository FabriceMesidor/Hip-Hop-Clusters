In a Ziploc\nTil the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not\nWhere my tear drop? I murdered it\nMy pot-holes is turbulence\nI'm in the sky wit it\nWhen you listening to Kendrick, just\n\n[Hook]\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nTurn me up some, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nTurn me up some, turn me up some\n\n[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]\nThis for my niggas that really rap all night\nNo sleep, do it with your eyes closed\nI can see your vision from Del-Amo\nPoppa took the television, but left the radio\nIll niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?\nIs this shit degrading or inspirational?\nI'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times\nI give you my word\n\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]\nCause I just gotta be heard\nI just gotta be heard\nI just gotta be heard\nSaid I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be\nHeard, heard, heard, heard\n\n[Hook]\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nTurn me up some, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nYo, turn me up some\nTurn me up some, turn me up some", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3i84smrrrfrufn8smf94khgv.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
