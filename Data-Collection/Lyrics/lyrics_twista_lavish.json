Take a look at all the people that got dubs\nYou ain't legitimate, you out here servin them rocks up\nI know you want the radio and screens to pop up\nBut we gotta get the money and try not to get locked up\nKnow the difference between real and fake\nFlipping work is just like flipping real estate\nOpen your mind, you got more than the skill to take\nCause I know\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Pharrell]\nUh, one time for my niggas on the corner\nWith the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks\nUh, two times for my niggas with they hands in the air\nSayin a prayer cause the game left their dude shot\nYes - I know that puzzle\nNiggas at each other thinkin they will bust you\nThe bang is the same even if it's muffled\nBut the moment so loud when a dead man hug you\nHe's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms\nYou gon' be lowered in your arms\nCryin to open the jar, and to add injury to insult\nYou're smokin your life away\nLook at me, big car big house big jewels\nAll that came out my backpack\nYou ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it\nEven though that hurt, I just skated past that\nLook - everybody got dreams about ki's\nChains full of ice with S after the V's\nHorse on the hood, a grill full with the B's\nDangling your feet in Santorini breeze\nMake a virtual picture, and spin around\nThat ain't it, well fuck it nigga we get it down\nNever try to grab your ankle nigga we'll kick 'em down\nFocus up, we gotta hit it now\nBruh when your cell goes clink, that's when you forfeit\nAll them dreams, all that divorce it\nYou ain't even get to see new mansion and Porsche shit\nThis dedicated to my man up in Norfolk, locked up\n\n[Hook]\n\nHa ha... wait {*repeat 2X*}\n\nMy nigga open yo' mind, mind\nAren't you ready to go?\nAll of my fears inside, side\nLet 'em blow like 'dro\n\n[Twista]\nThrough the wisdom of a prism I see I don't wanna go to prison\nI make the decision to get liver\nReminiscin as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac\nWhile I envision my ambitions as a rider\nListen to Pharrell spit to the track\nPull up in a burgundy Bentley with a bitch in the back\nI get to the paper like a hyper get to the crack\nI ain't speculatin homey I just stick to the facts, c'mon\n\nIf you wanna get the money and the status and the mob\nBetter ride when you roll with the crew\nTake a listen for the bub hit the bud\nWhen you hear this in the club then you know what to do\nLook at the vision of a mack spittin crack on the track\nThrow these stacks in the black Cadillac\nGet it like Twista and Neptunes, I got your back\nAnd know you\n\n[Hook]\n\nHa ha... wait {*repeat 2X*}\n\nMy nigga open yo' mind, mind\nAren't you ready to go?\nAll of my fears inside, side\nLet 'em blow like 'dro\n\nHa ha... wait {*repeat 2X*}\n\nHa ha... wait {*repeat 2X to fade*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6e50ebd81ceeb1860beb446ab2cdec8e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
