Why do I feel\nLike I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?\"\nIt's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits\nThat we don't even know we do it whenever it happens\nThen it settles in like I should've never did that shit\nI wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this\nIf you had to turn your test in today\nYou think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?\nWho knows, there's only one way to find out\nAnd if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal\n\n[Hook]\nGazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee\nHe says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me\nOh na\u2014na\u2014naaah\nGazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me\nBut mama told me never to talk to strangers", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb33e7a89a5050dc08095e21c220cc15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
