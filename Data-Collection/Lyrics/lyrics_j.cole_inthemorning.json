Do you smoke weed?\nDon't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees\nGettin' lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you\nIt's only fittin' 'cause I'm lookin' super fly with you\nA flower, you are powerful, you do somethin' to me\n'Cause girl, I caught the vibe like you threw somethin' to me\nSo I threw 'em back, now all my niggas hollerin', \u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\u201cOh boy, she bad nigga, what you 'bout to do with that?\u201d\nI'm finna take you home, just sip a little Patron\nNow we zonin', baby you so fine\n\n[Chorus: J.

Cole]\nHey, God bless the child that can hold his own\nGod bless the woman that can hold Patron\nGod bless her homegirl that drove us home\nNo strings attached like a cordless phone\nYou see my intentions with you was clear\nI'm learnin' not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear\nTherefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear\nGet all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career\nTo be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah\nSomehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here?\nJust say you're scared if you're scared\nBut if you through frontin', we can do somethin'\nAnd you know just what I'm talkin' about\nTomorrow you'll be callin' out\n'Cause tonight we gettin' right into the wee morn'\nCook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward\nThen I go my own way, you think about me all day\nThat's just a warnin'\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nAnd can I hit it in the mornin'?\nCan I hit it in the mornin'?\nCan I hit it in the mornin'?\nThe Sun risin' while you moanin'\nCan I hit it in the mornin'?\nCan I hit it in the mornin'?\nAnd can I hit it in the mornin'?\nThe Sun risin' while you moanin', yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ae722fa8fa10d75fe4b25dfeb4b8d8d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
