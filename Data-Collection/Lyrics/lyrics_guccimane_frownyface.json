Gucci!\n\n[Hook]\nHomie just texted me\nSay my nigga flexed him\nDummy brick-frowny face\nRabbit food-frowny face\nSay he wanna face me\nTell em \"Come and skraighten me\":\nSK-frowny face\nAK-frowny face\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy former label didn't trick me\nThey just did what was expected\nI was self-sufficient before\nI went independent selling records\nI know they're kick theyself in the ass\nI'm playing chess, they playing checkers\nAnd they know as well as I\nI eat they whole roster for breakfast\nI'm a bouldercrest professor\nYou should sign up this semester\nThat made me laugh cause I'm the king\nI cut your head off like the jester\nI'm standing tall as Manute Bol\nAnd y'all niggas shorter then Buster\nI'm the dopeman, y'all the workers\nSo I feed y'all with the extras\nLike Drake, Trey Songz and Wayne\nI just wanna be successful\nSuccessfully keeping my cool\nIn situations highly stressful\nI'm Gucci, all about the zeros\nComma, number and the decimal\nSo if you looking for a visit to the morgue\nThen I can help you\n\n[Hook]\nHomie just texted me\nSay my nigga flexed him\nDummy brick-frowny face\nRabbit food-frowny face\nSay he wanna face me\nTell em \"Come and skraighten me\":\nSK-frowny face\nAK-frowny face\n\n[Bridge]\nSitting here on the corner\nPumping crack and marijuana\nYou can try me if you wanna\nBut I promise you'll be a goner\nMy rep just won't let you do that\nI tote two straps, thought you knew that\nIf you come between my crew's stacks (Bricksquad!)\nI'll lay you flat like a doormat.
