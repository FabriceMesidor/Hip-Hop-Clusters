Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nAnd if you feel like you're the best\nGo 'head and do the Weezy-We, and\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nWe are not the same, I am a Martian\nAnd I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas\nLock, load, ready to aim at any target\nI could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target\nHip hop is my supermarket\nShopping cart full of fake hip hop artists\nI'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it\nAnd I'll be back in the morning\n\n[Chorus: Dre]\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nAnd if you feel like you're the best\nGo 'head and do the Weezy-We, and\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nWe are not the same, I am a alien\nLike Gonzales, young college\nStudent, who done just flipped the game like Houston\nI'm used to promethazine in two cups, I'm screwed up\nAnd you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up\nFlow so sick make you wanna throw your food up\nIce water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup\nTwo twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut\nI get bread like cold cuts, you know what?\nYour girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up\nWeezy!\n\n[Chorus: Dre]\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nAnd if you feel like you're the best\nGo 'head and do the Weezy-We, and\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nThey don't make 'em like me no more\nMatter of fact, they never made it like me before\nI'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair\nNo brake lights on my car rear\nI never had life and I never had fear\nI rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear\nAnd yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar\nAnd they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar\nI am so far from the othars, I meant others\nI just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover\n\n[Chorus: Dre]\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home! Weezy\nAnd if you feel like you're the best\nGo 'head and do the Weezy-We, and\nPhone home! Weezy\nPhone home!
