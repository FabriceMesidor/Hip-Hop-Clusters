Come on, bounce!\n*Gunshots* I said come on, bounce!\nEverybody in the house with a half an ounce (Me!)\nNot weed, I meant coke; dumb-ass, sit down!

I don't know\n\n[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]\nPop pills, pills I pop\nPop two pills, on stilts I walk\nSnort two lines that were filled with chalk\nThought I was incredible and killed the Hulk\nI wanna roll away like a rollerblade\nUntil my eyes roll back in my skull for days\nAnd when I'm old and gray look for dope to smoke?\nNo? Okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke\n(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?\nHad an accident when the Trojan broke\nAh, poor baby, born by a whore lady\nNow I gotta strangle an {infant} (You're crazy!)\n\n[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]\nI pop four E's at one time\nAnd I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine\n(Hey, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?\nWe can't get jobs, 'cause our arms show tracks\nWhy the hell you niggas think I rap?\nWe do it just to get your company hijacked\nIf you like smack, then I might too\n(Swift, chill!) I just wanna get high like you\nAnd I don't give a damn if they white or blue (Huh-uh)\nSpeed, shrooms, down the Valiums (Huh-uh)\nEven smoke weed out of vacuums\nI just copped some and I'm goin' back soon\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI take a couple uppers\nI down a couple downers\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple pills\nI been to mushroom mountain\nOnce or twice, but who's countin'?\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple pills\n\n[Verse 5: Bizarre]\nI'm at a rave, lookin' like a slave\nHigh off chronic\nGin and tonic demonic\nBody smell like vomit\nPussy poppin', acid droppin'\nDope-heady guy\nHeroin mescaline\nPencil leads, wanna try?\nBlue pills, golden seals\nGot Bizarre actin' ill\nDrugs kill (Yeah, right)\nBitch, I'm for real!\nShut yo' mouth, you dirty slut\nYou know you want it in your butt\nI'll put it in your cunt\nLet Bizarre nut!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI take a couple uppers\nI down a couple downers\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple pills\nI been to mushroom mountain\nOnce or twice, but who's countin'?\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple pills\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nDirty Dozen, eighty of us\nShady brothers, ladies love us\nThat's why our baby mothers\nLove us but they hate each other\nThey probably wanna take each other\nOut and date each other\nSome, some, some\nSomethin'...
