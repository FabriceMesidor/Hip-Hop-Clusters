Why Emcee? Hey\nI do it for my village\nThe pennin' is John Lennon, the beat is the Beatles\nGo together like Lenin and the people\nIn some fresh linens and some John Lennon\u2019s fresh outta Seagle's\nThe pen and the needles...\n\n[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm back at cha, and I Pac like cap backwards\nLike a hat's backwards, you know, when the bats backwards\nYeah, like a bat catchers\nThe law gotta long arm like a back scratcher\nBut before I leave mine at home\nLike a bad catcher, I think about my zone\nWhere pimps make scratch off the track like a DJ\nEasy, that\u2019s my zone rappers\nIt's my deck\nAnd if I catch u set trippin\u2019 wit my cassette sittin\u2019 in a zone rappers:\nIt's not a threat\nCuz it'll span ya where I roam rappers, where I hone my skills\nThey wanna send me back home the devil, is on my heels\nThe writing is Sting, liken the sequences, the Police, I repeat\nWe go together like the Beauty and the Beast\nWriting is in my veins;\nThe ink is the diesel, the pen and the needles\u2026\n\n[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]\n\nThe word is mightier than the sword\nAnd my serve is tightier than yours\nLike year in St. Louis ya whole flow\nI fear I sank through it...\nIt all became clear\nLike a paramedic with an electric chest kit, YEAH\nThe gravity of the vocabulary is a caliber equal to Excalibur\nSwung wit the grace of Agassi in his amateurs, THERE\nThere was a deeper depth, don't know how I got here\nI also had a hole in my flow\nIt appears I sank to it...\nMy swing, it couldn\u2019t be seen\nI apply some paint to it, the invisible man\nWrapped in bandages, in critical, CLEAR\nThe scriptin' of Scorsese the score is Count Basie\nWe go together like, the original and the sequel\nThis is the end of the trilogy, ya feelin\u2019 me?\nThe pen and the needles...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9922f7078ce1f910a0541c33e13cce5b.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
