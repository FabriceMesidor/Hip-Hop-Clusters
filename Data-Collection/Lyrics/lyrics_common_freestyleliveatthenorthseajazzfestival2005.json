yourself, girl, be so clear\n\nIt went, honey, check it out, she had me mesmerized\nWith them nice braids and them nice ol' thighs\nStreet poetry, that's my everyday\nI come to North Sea, yo, on a Sunday\nSo I could say what I can, I ain't in the fog\nI come to rock it when I come to Den Haag\nAnd you should understand why I came to slam\nEarlier today I was in Amsterdam\nAnd later on tonight I'ma be rockin' a party\nAnd this is what I do, Com Sense speak godly\nSomebody out there, yo, they chillin' in the lobby\nThey about to come in, they heart 'riem drummin'\nWe strummin' 'em in with the music\nPeople wanna use it, don't confuse it, this ain't for amusement\nThis is for learnin' and burnin' your soul\nTurnin' the whole road down\nConstants, yo, I hold down\nMy soul's around for people that need to touch it\nUnderstand Com Sense, I love it when I'm rugged\nAnd sometimes I get a little softer\nNever been soft, I'm killin' them, I fill 'em, put in a coffin\nIf I need to, this is what I do, I make it bleed through\nThe whole situation, anticipation\nOf an album that's coming, it's called Finding Forever\nAnd what'll happen when I put my mind together\nWith that, me and my brother named Ye and Jay Dee\nAnd plus the 'riem baking is why MC\nIt be the type of brothers that come down with real sound\nThat's what I've been doing 'cause I hold my ill ground\nAnd I could tell you, yo, Com been on a mission\nLookin' in the front row and I seen this couple kissin'\nAnd I knew it was all love when I came in the place\nI used to have my man Arthur on the bass\nMaybe he'll come back soon, still I just rap tunes\nRap tunes and do what I can, I'm like Black Moon\nHow many emcees must get dissed\nBefore somebody says \"Don't fuck with Sense\"?\nAnd this is just one style, yo, money\nYou should understand on the 1 and 2's is Dummy\nAnd my nose is runny 'cause I'm cold like that\nYou should understand in my throat I hold my raps\nAnd when I spit 'em, I could understand you's a victim\nTo go against it, yo, you get missed with\nThe brother Common Sense, yo, check it out, I invented\nA different type of style and I stayed centered\nIn this down place where I could often MC\nRockin' to the face of the what, the North Sea\nAnd yesterday, they say you hot as a stove\nYo, they said yesterday my man was Roy Hargrove\nAnd he was playing, this is what I'm doing in the place\nThe brother Common Sense coming straight from his face\nAnd this is what I do, yo, I could kick a beat again\nI'll get on the keys like my name was Oscar Peterson\nBut no, that ain't me\nMy name is Rashid, and I could still get on the 88 keys\nOr Fender Rhodes and I'll kick some soul\nIt's the brother Com Sense...*plays keys*\nTryna find a note but I'm fucked up\n'Cause yo, I was chillin' for a second bein' dope\nAnd you should know my rhymes'll float\nMy mind afloat, and this is what I do to provoke\nA crowd, Com Sense, yo, I love to freestyle\nGet loud, and I'm from the place called Stony Isle\nRight in front of the cameras, Derek is the manager\nI've never been an amateur, I slam at ya\nIf I have to, yo, record this\nCommon Sense, check it out, girls say I'm gorgeous\nNah, that ain't the word for it, they say I'm a real nigga\nIf this was slavery days, I'd be a field nigga\nOr credit, yet a King, Com Sense kick a dream\nLike Martin Luther, rest in peace to Luther\nI be the trooper from the city of the Chi\nAnd lookin', yo, I'm ready with my eye and I'm ready with the fly\nI'm fly like the zipper, yo, I be the microphone ripper\nBack in the days, I acted in ways\nLike a young B-boy, now I be that B-boy with an album named BE\nGirls smile at me and say they like that song \"Love\" and the song called \"The Light\"\nI do it right, hittin' ya on a Sunday night\nAfternoon, Com Sense get in the tune\nPeople, yo, you with the camera, you can zoom\nIn and see, how fresh I be\nIt be the Common Sense, used to drink Hennessy\nMemories going down while I'm giving a pound\nCom Sense coming from where, yo, the Chi-town\nI ain't wanna stop, I love the real hip-hop\nPeople say hip-hop changed when my shit dropped\nAnd they said, \"Aw man, your stuff, we love that rap shit\"\nThey said, \"Common, the album BE's a classic\"\nThey gave me 5 Mics and 5 stars, I come do live bars\nAnd understand why I'm live, gods\nKnow what time it is when I come up in the place\nIt's Common Sense coming straight from his face\nAnd this is what I do for people in the North Sea Festival\nYo, I'm still staying on schedule\nGot a show tonight at the Paradiso\nAnd we gon' do what we can just to let loose flows go\nI see my man in the crowd in amazement\nThis is what we do when you come to the basement\nYou get real placement of real hip-hop\nYo, it's like that, my shit don't stop\nIt's like that and you don't stop\nRelax yourself girl, be so clear\nCome on, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nCome on, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nRelax yourself girl, be so clear\nRelax yourself girl, be so clear\nCome on, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nCome on, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nCome on, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nWe go, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nIt go, relax yourself girl, be so clear\nRelax yourself girl, be so clear\nRelax yourself girl, be so clear", "image":
