Go for broke\nHis cup just runneth over, oh no\nHe ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nTheyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know\nRap will never be the same as before\nBashing in the brains of these hoes\nAnd establishing a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited\nYou can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot\nYou dealin with a few true villains\nWhose stand inside of the booth truth spillin\nAnd spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths\nNow rewind it!\nPayback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?\nWhen I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place\nIm Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place\nSo Drake\n\n[Evanescence] (x2)\nI tried to kill my pain\nBut only brought more\nSo much more\nI lay dying\nAnd I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
