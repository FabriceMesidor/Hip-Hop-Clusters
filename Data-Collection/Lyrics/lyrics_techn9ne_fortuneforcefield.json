It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhy you wanna try to take my bill ticket?\nI mean real wicked, I seem real livid\nI've been filled with it, I mean vexed\nUn-ex-pect-ted-ness, when everything is the best\nI get a minute to rest, but then a nigga regrets\nI gets the money but next I'm in debt\n(I won, what?) I mean I lost, take green from a boss\nBe the things that I dream, but they intervene they get my creme, then I'm off\n(Whose they?)\nThey turned the motherfuckin' best position into a deposition\nDealing with that will make you wanna ex the mission\nNever no checks to get to and that's the bitching\nHow do I maintain my autonomy\nWith so many leeches in this economy?\nMy moaning is mearly monetary\nBut the moment it's really gone is scary\nTry to beat my high score, but I fight forward despite lawyers\nAn eye for an eye because my type's warrior\nNever the less I inherit a mess, a big floor spill\nI'm steady pushing to break down this fortune force field\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!) It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, it's like pulling a bad one\nGet her off at the pad, then get the Jimmy to stab some\nBut you can't and puddy is right there\nLike a, barrier or something, keeping you from her such a negative type lair\nYou can never pipe nair when you've got it in front of you, wanna do, it's a pitiful nightmare\nIt's like making a baby\nYou never having it, is making you crazy\nAnd toting a living human, it's making you weighty\nKick, kick, kick, shaking your lady\nLike late in the 80's, got my name and got to taking the stage, V\nTold the people I got Satan to save me, that's why radio be hating to play me\nEverything you gain only brings you pain\nBut the fame it fools the brain\nBut you regain it through Strange\nYeah, never put your guard down\nBecause I wanna bang, bang, bang hard now\nI'm a warhound, never mistaken I kick walls down\nTo the ground and get applause sound because I got even, then I'm lard bound\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!) It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Bridge]\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\nFuck your litigation\nWe gon' win, just a bit of waiting\nEverytime that I get ahead gotta be a motherfuckin' drawback\nSo I'mma draw back and bang them bitches 'til they all crack\nMSC look what you've done to me\nKept the first five I done for me\nAnd you others know that Caribou Lou belong to me\nYou come for me\nJust know we will never settle, war is what it's gonna be!\n\n[Chorus]\n(So!) It's on for tonight\n(Oh!) Hope this wall is ready for a fight\n(Yo!) In this hole I'm reaching for the light\n(No!) A lot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Bridge]\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\nLot of dreams are lost in the night\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, been breaking down that fortune force field for a long time\nNow I get my just due", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ae74b38ee85ff63c76433b31ae507a23.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
