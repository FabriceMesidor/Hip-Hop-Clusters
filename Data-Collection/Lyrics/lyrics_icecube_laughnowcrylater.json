I'mma kill her ass when a nigga make parole\nHit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube]\nMan, it ain't right man\nY'know y'all ain't doin me right man\nA nigga tryin to do right man\nY'know I'm tryin to change my life man, y'know?\nI done found the Lord while I'm in here, y'know?\nI I'm tryin to do right now, I mean\nY'know I'm sorry for everythang\nThat I, I I mean y'know\nThat's fucked up how y'all doin me man\nY'all niggas could at least send me somethin\n\n\"Alright, first four guys, let's go... lock it up\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4141aa982e145b56c3c52c3fbd1c258.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
