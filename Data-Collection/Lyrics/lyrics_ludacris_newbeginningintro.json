Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person to the point when they no longer give a fuck. There comes a time in life where you walk away from all the drama and the people who create that shit. Destroy what destroys you! You'll never see all the great things ahead if you keep looking at all the bad things behind you. They say the hardest things in life is know which bridge to cross and which ones to burn. So may the bridges I burn light yo motherfuckin' way!\n(So what's the number one cause of all these problems?)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f356789e90ae64b52a6861b7f419af77.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
