We need champagne\nNow look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand\nAnd now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames\nNow cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain\nBut not too loud cause the baby's sleeping\nI wonder if it knows what the world is keeping\nUp both sleeves while he lay there dreaming\nMe and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping\nI had to turn my back on what got you paid\nI couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib\nBut I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy\nAnd all the televisions out there that raised me\nI was\n\n[Hook: Jill Scott]\nDaydream\nI fell asleep beneath the flowers\nFor a couple of hours\nWhat a beautiful day\nDaydream\nI dream of you amid the flowers\nFor a couple of hours\nSuch a beautiful day\nDaydream\nI fell asleep beneath the flowers\nFor a couple of hours\nSuch a beautiful day\nDaydream\nI dream of you amid the flowers\nFor a couple of hours\nSuch a beautiful day\n\n[Outro]\n(Dream, dream)\n(Dream, dream)\n(Dream, dream)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/373c57c9cfddd95f1d232784084809ba.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
