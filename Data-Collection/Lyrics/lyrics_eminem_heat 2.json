Reilly]\nWanna take it from the top?\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nLady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit\n'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents\nTwo ass-cheek implants, call that an asset\n'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive\nFrom the first time I saw you, I actually\nSaid to myself: \"I gotta meet her\" like a taxi\nExactly, love affair in the backseat\nSorry if I'm being graphic\nBut I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf\nI feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself\nLet me slow down, slow your Camaro\nI'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow\nGot me under your control and your spell\nWanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow\nGrab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact\nAbout the only thing I agree on with Donald is that\nSo when I put this palm on your cat\nDon't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed\nWhy you think they call it a snatch?\nI just wanna climb in the sack\nI'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at\nI'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back\nAbout six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nAll day, all day, all night\nYou ask, I'll stay the night\nWith you, you say you're fire\nMe too, you're burning up\nI want it\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C.

At least that ain't up in the air for some to see\nSo like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink\nIf she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve\nMaybe she wants to keep me company\nBut fuck the Pep\u00e9 Le Pew shit!\n\"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch,\" I say to myself\nPlus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat\nI could sweat her to some degree\nBut fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me\n(Could you repeat that again?)\n\"Letter\" come to me\u2014\"mail.\" \"Sweater\", \"heat,\" \"some degree.\"  Fail\nFuck it, pull up beside her\nSideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright\nI ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina\nSaid my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her\nI said\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nAll day, all day, all night\nYou ask, I'll stay the night\nWith you, you say you're fire\nMe too, you're burning up\nI want it\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]\nAll day, all night\nYou feel, my heat (fire)\nFeel, feel, feel, feel, feel\nMy heat\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nBlack out, come to, hands covered in blood\nMotherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud\nI just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug\n'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)\nSo let's get turnt like a shish kabab\nTwist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob\nWe'd be great together\nDon't care if it takes forever\nIf I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never\nYou felt my heat rubbin' off on ya\nI love your personality, come on, little mama\nYou're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water\nI bet you get your self-esteem from your persona\nWith an ass to match, girl, your\nBody is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're\nJust gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner\nYou got buns, I got Asperger's\nJust let me rest my head between that set of D's\nWhile I shred MC's like cheddar cheese\nThat's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed\nMy dog thinks so too\u2014look at my pedigree! (Roof!)\nMa, the world is what I think of you\nI think you're divine, so I might swing on you\nI'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too\nUnless it's the middle one to finger you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]\nAll day, all day, all night\nYou ask, I'll stay the night\nWith you, you say you're fire\nMe too, you're burning up\nI want it\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]\nFeel, feel, feel, feel, feel\nMy heat\n\n[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]\nOn the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'\nRick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)\nHe's mixin' it up for me, and you're in\nA teddy like short for Theodore\nWe're outtie, five thousand\nI wanna fuck, it's my big dick\nSo everybody get ready fucking now!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/edd76153e7ac3ec36be997aea55f32ed.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
