this girl, her name was Joan\nShe loved the way I rocked on the microphone\nWhen I met Joan, I took her home\nShe was just like a doggy all on my bone\nI met another girl, her name was Ann\nAll she wanted was to freak with a man\nWhen I met Ann, I shook her hand\nWe ended up freakin' by a garbage can\nThe next young freak I met was Red\nI took her to the house and she gave me head\nShe likes to freak is all she said\nWe jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed\nThere's another girl, her name is Mary\nTalk about sex and the girl acts scary\nI heard she was freakin' from my homeboy Jerry\nTook her to the house and I popped that cherry\nYoung and tender, sweet Denise\nGet her in the bed and the girl's a beast\nI tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece\nShe'll only start talking about signing a lease\nI met this tender, her name was Lori\nAn X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story\nShe had a twin sister, her name was Lisa\nAnd just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser\nMy girlfriend's name was Michelle\nHer booty was bigger than a tail on a whale\nWhen I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well\nHer pussy got hotter than the flames in hell\nI G'd this girl, her name is Tammy\nI didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy\nShe had a best friend, her name was Jane\nI pulled her to the side and I spit that game\nI met a lot of freaks in my lifespan\nFreaked one night with a girl named Pam\nThe very next day I saw her with her man\nOne week passed and I was in her again\nI had an old tender, her name's Janine\nShe was 32 and I was only eighteen\nShe likes to freak, she's just a fiend\nIt really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans\nI want a big freak, fat and sloppy\nI kick on back and I watch her mop me\nTwo tons of fun, big Mamma Jamma\nA country-girl from Alabama\nI met this freak, her name was Beth\nHer pussy got wet and it smelled like death\nI was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat\nBut I was all up in her trying to hold my breath\nBake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas\nShe said her name was Dinah\nShe was a built little freak from China\nI said I don't pimp or gigolo\nI'm having so much money that I don't need a hoe\nYou can break yourself but you can't break me\nYou never met a player like $hort, baby\nI knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo\nTook her to my house and we did it on the floor\nThe girl got freaky and I'll tell you more\nShe was down on her knees begging to blow\nShe's like another freak named Ren\u00e9e\nYou get her alone and she'll make your day\nLike Burger King, she knows the play\nBut a freak like Ren\u00e9e, you can have it your way...\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\nI met this girl, thick as hell\nOnly sixteen, said her name was Linell\nI took her to my house, I could not wait\nHer shit was much tighter than a Century Safe\nLet me tell you this since we're talking young\nI met another girl, said her name was Yvonne\nAlways talking about having fun\nOnce again at the pad I had it going on\nI'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk\nI'm trying to get funky like \"Female Funk\"\nSo when you see me coming or see me going\nI keep my money, let the hoes keep hoeing\nI once met a hooker, she did it for free\nOn the Foothill bus number forty-three\nAll the way in the back she was working me\nHad my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat\nI met this freak named Antoinette\nMacked on baby like an ice cold vet\nEverything she had is what I get\n'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit\nI met another freak, her name was Rita\nBaby thought that Too $hort just might eat her\nI told her like this, she could suck my peter\nOr either go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her\nScratched her name out my telephone book\nNever again took a second look\n'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon\nShe kept looking while I kept staring\nBaby came through with my homeboy Darren\nHer booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing\nShe never left, he cut out\nI know you all know what I'm talking about\nThere's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner\nShe smokes that pipe and she's getting thinner\nShannon is cool but her mind is gone\nOne fat rock and it's going on\nShe had another buddy, came by my place\nThick ass bitch, said her name was Grace\nShe walked in the door working lace\nYou shoulda seen that look that was on my face\nShe's like this tender named Belinda\nThe homeboys called her 'Belinda the Blender'\nShe gave head like she made it up\nShe was twenty years old with a big round butt\nHad a girl looked like Olive Oyl\nHer father was rich and the girl was spoiled\nWhen she got mad, her blood would boil\nBut I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\nSugar Delight\nFriday night\nIt's going on\nToo $hort\n\nThree weeks ago, I met this freak\nShe followed me around like Mary's sheep\nI hid around the corner and when she came\nI grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name\nShe said it was Anita\nHer man's in Santa Rita\nI took her to my house and homeboy, I G'd her\nSent her on her way\nThe very next day, Playboy $hort was ready to play\nI bumped into this girl, her name's Roshawn\nWe hit the motel and had it going on\nHoliday Inn to the break of dawn\nWhen I took baby home, I freaked her mom\nI knew this tender named Shari\nI took her to the house and let her freak on me\nBaby was a fan, she loved my beat\nBut I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet\nI met this freak named Yolanda\nRolled baby doll like a brand new Honda\nI was on top, she was up under\nThe bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder\nI once had a date with a girl named Kitty\nShe was so fine with her big fat titties\nAll night long she was acting shitty\nSo I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti\nThere's another girl, her name is Rose\nI use to ride baby like brand new Vogues\nI never saw Rose wearing clothes\nShe's a Penthouse pet, ready to pose\nI was riding down the street when I met Janet\nHer booty was bigger than the whole damn planet\nAss everywhere, I just can't stand it\nTried to palm it but I could not manage\nI had this freak, her name was Bunny\nSaid I'm the only man who ever called her honey\nEverything I did to her was funny\nI macked on Bunny and I took her money\nEight, tonight, a date, with Shirley\nShe was real short and her hair was curly\nIf you saw baby you liked this girlie\nShe was so fine I went to get her early\nShirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel\nHer bite was vicious and it sure was fatal\nShe liked to kiss all on my navel\nThose are her lips on top of my label\nI knew another freak, her name was Candy\nReal big lips and they came in handy\nI smooth got worked and it was so dandy\nI hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy\nHe did me a favor in return\nGave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne\nBaby got tossed, then I got on\nI grabbed the microphone and started singing my song\nMy young homeboy heard me rap\nAnd said he had way more freaks than that\nSo I told him like this, they might be freaking\nBut, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe6f5cfe28f3b6fbf6c03526f9b3dc11.499x490x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
