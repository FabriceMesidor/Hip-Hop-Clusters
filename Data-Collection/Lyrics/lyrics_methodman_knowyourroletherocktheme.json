Make you crumble\nIn these Wrestlemanias, kid, we Royal Rumble\nTelling us that Raw is War, what the hell you think we came for?\nJust to play with these whips and chainsaws? And sharp glass\nI'll shine them up real nice, turn them sideways\nAnd shove them up your candy ass\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nYo, yo, this is it y'all, Summer Slam, Summer Sam'd out\nIt's Thursday Night Smackdown, there's No Way Out\nNow you got a problem, with the Brahma Bull\nTime to throw Rock Bottom\nAin't no way to stop him\nSee the People's Eyebrow, ignite the crowd\nInto a feeding frenzy, they want blood now\nChinlock and chair shots, suplexes, legdrops\nFinish with the People's Elbow and sign it Rock\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nIf you smell what The Rock's cooking\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?\nDo you smell what The Rock is cooking?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3957c1b312447b0d434fba5f3690936.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
