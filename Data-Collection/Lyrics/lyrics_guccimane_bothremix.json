You grew up with me\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now, got me talking about my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now and I need ya in my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYeah, I'm both\nYeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked\nYeah, you think I need you but I don't\nJust left out Dubai with all my folk\nOpen water, my location is remote\nShout-out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat\nThis some shit I wrote about when I was broke\nSee, the power of the mind is not a joke\nMan, I said that I would do it and I did\nUsed to get left-overs out the fridge\nNobody was famous where I lived\nTill I got it jumping at the crib\nTook a lot to be able to give, I mean\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now, got me talking about my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now and I need ya in my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\n\n[Outro: Southside]\nSouthside", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4484b4484e57e363f0990607a94c0379.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
