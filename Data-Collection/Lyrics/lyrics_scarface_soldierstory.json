Told us about the heroin\nSold us alcohol and the guns that we carry 'round\nCan't blame us for everything goin' wrong in the States\nI don't blame a nigga for nothin' he do to get cake\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nIt's like the ghetto's got a heart and a soul, a mind of it's own\nA hunger for a young cat to die 'fore he grown\nA lust for a young girl to slide down a pole\nShe's always fallin' short on her goals\nThe street life is cold, it's either win or lose or you fold\nMoney is the root to all evils what I was told\nWhen everything you thought you'd believed in was a hoax\nYou put your faith in front of those demons\nAnd when the smoke clears, the truth appear\nThe fight for your life, the struggles of a wrong versus right\nAnd wrong won, a song sung in the keys of reality\nWhen death crosses your path, blood shed tragically\nSo automatically you come to a close and realize\nThat no matter what we key to the codes\nI seen the hood swallow muthafuckas whole\nThen shit 'em out in the system ain't never make it home, that I know\n\n[Hook:]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6976a10236f881255b574212a02ae481.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
