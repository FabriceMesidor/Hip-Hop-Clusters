Blige\nImagining how good the cat must be\nStop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky\nMy verse depth, is that of a baby's first step\nOr the old lady who died and the nurse wept\nI flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess\nShows allow me to cop range like a vocalist\nBut man does not live on bread alone\nWhat good is a range when it's time to head home?\n\n[Chorus: J Dilla]\nI wanna get into it\nLet\u2019s do this\nI wanna see you move it\nSo move it\nSo let\u2019s just get into it\nLet\u2019s do this\nCan you feel the music?\nThe music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music\nI wanna get into it\nLet\u2019s do this\nI wanna see you move it\nSo move it\nSo let\u2019s just get into it\nLet\u2019s do this\nCan you feel the music?\nThe music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music\n\n[Outro]\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac\nWe be that, we be that\nAfrodisiac, 'disiac", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8dbc84c60c9d76fe49cdbcee56ef974c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
