You know what I'm saying? So\nI'mma talk about this one I had a few years ago\n\n[Verse]\nI had a friend named Cutie Tootie\nTootie turned tricks to get some Gucci\nKnown as loose bootie\nTruly, she was a freak in the evenin'\nAnd if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason\nWhy she do dat? Always knew dat\nShe was hot as da nectar\nHector said he pecked her, disrespected her\n'Cause he bang bang, swang in his dingalang\nBroke his back long range\nAnd make the ugly bitch sing\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\n\n[Verse 2]\nCutie Tootie with her sight\nAnd if she humped Ralph\nShe humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike\nTight is the way she wore her dresses\nHas she learned her lesson\nFrom all the dick testing\nNow I'm guessing (Now I'm guessing)\nShe's laying in a casket, in a yellow basket\nFor a Gucci jacket\nDaggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things\n'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\n\n[Verse 3]\nTootie didn't know the facts of life\nStaying up in clinics, loosy bootie made trife\nFeeling, she got the heebie geebies\nQuick to give you freebies\nUnderneath the staircase in Brooklyn\nNeighbors out the window sure was lookin'\nShe greasy like chicken\nI don't give a cotton pick and\nShe can do her thing\n'Cause me and her don't hang\nThe ugly bitch sang\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nOoh, ooh\nWhy you hurt me?\nTell me why more\nOoh, ooh\nUh-huh\n\n[Outro]\nSo you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody\nWho's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank\nOnce again, going around humping everybody\nEverybody and anybody and anything\nThat's why you make the ugly bitch sing\nOoh, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2f8d14420255722b5068b9dac8cfd6ef.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Missy Elliott"}
