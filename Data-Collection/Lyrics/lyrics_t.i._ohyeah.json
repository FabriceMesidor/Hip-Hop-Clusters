Respect me\nTake an act of God 'fore a nigga check me\nOn his P's and Q's what a nigga best be\nWho you got your money on? Bet me, let's see\nWho the people want\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nWhen they see you, they might judge you\nGive you side eyes, they don't trust you\nMisunderstand you, call you trouble\nI understand you, it's just a hustle\nJust keep stirin' it, let it bubble\nYou're my brother, I'm not above you\nRemember me I'm so there\nDon't make us have to go there\nTurn and sing it\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue\nWhen your request is denied, bet my demand'll get through\nThey may be killers to you, hey they my family dude\nAnd anybody could get it, bitch but especially you\nThese nigga pressin' me, testin', what you suggestin' we do?\nAnd wait a second, push your pawn to play chess with these dude\nYeah we could jump 'em and check em by sprayin' tecs at these fools\nMake it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose\nYour bet make yo next move, your best move\nOr end up in the pen like the next dude\nRemember, there's very few like you they let through\nThey even fewer, they didn't want in there, they get through\nTo get to the level you on, hard to do homes\nMore nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong\nAnd you gone, out of there, nigga see you later\n'Less you beat 'em a year later, Boosie tell 'em\nWho the people want\n\n[Hook]\nWhen they see you, they might judge you\nGive you side eyes, they don't trust you\nMisunderstand you, call you trouble\nI understand you, it's just a hustle\nJust keep stirin' it, let it bubble\nYou're my brother, I'm not above you\nRemember me I'm so there\nDon't make us have to go there\nTurn and sing it\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nGet T.I. in the Chi, handshake it with 5\nStill politicin' with 6 pimp I'm as real as it gets\nAnd bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry\nAin't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity\nSay what my pedigree? Solid, gats you talkin' bout, I shot it\nBet you never been to war like I ain't never been to college\nC'mon, fuck what you tellin' me, them lies, chill with 'em\nI know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em\nSaid you coded took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda\nLet them sucka niggas rob you, they ain't kill you but they shoulda\nAnd a robbery for me is like a suicide mission\nSuicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence\nI swear, you and me ain't even fit to compare\nI ain't make it all these years on a wing and a prayer\nStare in a bigger nigga eye while he standing right there\nGot a problem I'ma handle it right there\nWho the people want\n\n[Hook]\nWhen they see you, they might judge you\nGive you side eyes, they don't trust you\nMisunderstand you, call you trouble\nI understand you, it's just a hustle\nJust keep stirin' it, let it bubble\nYou're my brother, I'm not above you\nRemember me I'm so there\nDon't make us have to go there\nTurn and sing it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0aedeee6f38d44bf87bbee70cb36cca3.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
