flat boys, hmh-hmh-hmh\nThat's what you wanna call us anyway\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races\n\n[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]\nStarsky and Hutch minus the fuzz\nMe and Spitta stick together like, huh\nCotton and mud, some chicks counting up buds\nMouth got cotton, prolly from the drugs\nLot of pot in my process, love\nDon't hate a nigga cause I'm blessed, judge me by my progress, bruh\nI obsess with every dollar I get\nFuck you think we made it out the projects for?\nThe object is to make money and get the most from it\nAnd more money, cause more money ain't enough of it\nI know niggas who had money and let it go to nothing\nJust blow money and ain't got nothing to show for it, that\u2019s fucking stupid\nSame as my diamonds and the fact I\u2019m buying all this new shit\nMade a million a way, a nigga grind\u2019ll be a blueprint\nI\u2019m talking champagne shit, Audemar tailor made shit\nLook at my jackets, say hand made bitch\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races\n\n[Verse 2: Curren$y]\nAnd I'm a pimp, see\nLeaning in my ride like how Bun B\nSitting tall on my chrome seat but I\u2019m low in the seat\nMy girl in the sheet fast asleep, I\u2019m in the street\nAfter the cheddar, peddling melodies, purchasing better things\nOn the road to the riches, I done drove over niggas\nMy nigga we major, we been major since independent\nMade it to what they saying, we made it but we ain't hearing it\nWe too busy getting it, hound dog sniffing it out\nTwisting a whole pound, celebrating the fact that\nThem wack fools had it but this here\u2019s the take back\nAnd them haters can\u2019t hate that\nSalute me from across a crowded club, homie, I take that as love\nReal nigga shit the only thing I\u2019m dealing with slim\nBitch you know that I\u2019m the reason that you still in this club\nGet out the corner of my eye and get in this truck\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nYelling, \"Suck a dick or die hoe\"\nSee your main bitch is my side hoe\nSmoking top shelf on the top floor\nI\u2019m a boss bitch, I take my time and get it pronto\nYou probably fucking around\nDoing some shit I ain't got time for (pussy boy)\nFuck you and your whole anatomy bitch\nMy new crib look like an academy bitch\nIt\u2019s Finally Famous the faculty bitch\nKillin\u2019 these niggas, no casualties\nMoney and weed is a real nigga salary\nMan, these rappers sound like me\nAnd honestly that shit is so flattering bitch\n(Thank you, thank you, thank you) They want me to slip up and fall\nCrash, burn, but I just keep pissing them off (off)\nI got movies to make (make) I got women to call (call)\nI got deals on the table, I can\u2019t be dealing with y\u2019all, nigga\nRather crash parties and burn money (money)\nAnd if you pick the ashes up, you still can\u2019t earn from me (from me)\nBottom line is I never wait in line bitch\nAnd I\u2019m rolling King Kush, I\u2019m your Royal Highness\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nThey're saying it\u2019s 'bout time some real niggas made it\nAnd when I go outside, they're saying I\u2019m famous\nAnd some don\u2019t understand but listen close and you\u2019ll find out\nI\u2019m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out\nI\u2019m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign\nI travel across seas where women are gorgeous\nAnd niggas know it\u2019s us, we make it tough to mistake it\nJust let me roll one up and when it\u2019s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it\nThen we off to the races", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d2467c5cfb81a7e23118458ff4326e1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
