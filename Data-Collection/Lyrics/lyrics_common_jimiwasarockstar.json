(set me free)\n\n[Verse 3: Erykah Badu & Common]\nSo high, born to fly\nGetting high off his own supply\nWith the most highs of the sky\nEverybody follows the same lord\nChoosing his light to guide the way\nYou do, but who do you choose?\nSome try things but few die so young\nSomething among Jimi was stung\nEveryone hides their faces\nBehind a mask they wear\n\n[Outro: Erykah Badu]\n(Jimi, come out why don't you set me free?)\n[Repeat until fade out]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f09b702f3b5aead8b4d73c0bfdb708e.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
