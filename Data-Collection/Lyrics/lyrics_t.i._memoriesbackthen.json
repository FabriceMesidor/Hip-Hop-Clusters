I know\n\n[Hook: Kris Stephens]\nWhen the lights go out\nAnd I'm in my bed\nI think of all the madness in my head\nAll of the things that I did back then\nWhen I'm in my bed\nI think of all the memories I've had\nAll of the things I did back then", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c5ebea9a4eb0bd756121a9711033914c.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
