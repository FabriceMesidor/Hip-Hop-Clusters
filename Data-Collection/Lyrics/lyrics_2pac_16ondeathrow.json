He snitched and told a friend\nIt's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers\nAnd fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners\n\n[Hook]\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\n[Verse 2]\nDear Mama, these cops don't understand me\nI turned to a life of crime \u2018cause I came from a broken family\nMy uncle used to touch me, I never told you that\nScared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back\nI kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger\nI'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger\nThe brother in my cell is 16 as well\nIt's hard to adapt when you're black\nAnd you're trapped in a living hell\nI shouldn't have let him catch me\nInstead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy\nAnd my cellmate's raped on the norm\nAnd passed around the dorm\nYou can hear his asshole gettin' torn\nThey made me an animal\nCan't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals\nAnd that's how it is in the pen\nTurn old and cold and your soul is your best friend\nMy mama, pray for me\nTell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me\n(Why?) \u2018Cause when they come for me they find a struggler\nTo the death I take the breath from your jugular\nThe trick is to never lose hope\nI found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row\n\n[Hook]\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\n[Verse 3]\nDear Mama, they sentenced me to death\nToday's my final day, I'm countin' every breath\nI'm bitter \u2018cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen\nI know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16\nI got beef with a sick society\nThat doesn't give a shit and they too quick to say goodbye to me\nThey tell me the preacher's there for me\nHe's a crook with a book, that mothafucka never cared for me\nHe's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God\nAbout the crimes he's committin' on the poor\nAnd how can these people judge me?\nThey ain't my peers, and in all these years they ain't never love me\nI never got to be a man\nMust be part of some big plan to keep a nigga in the state pen\nAnd to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas\nSteer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas\n\u2018Cause once they got you locked up\nThey got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up\nI'm convinced, self-defense is the way\nPlease stay strapped, pack a gat every day\nI wish I woulda known while I was out there\nNow I'm straight headin' for the chair\n\n[Hook]\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\n[Outro]\n16 on Death Row, Death Row\nDeath Row, Death Row\n16 on Death Row, Death Row, Death Row\nIt's to all my partners\nIn the penitentiaries; 16 on Death Row", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f924e981b74c6d754d2c9da26f83f15.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
