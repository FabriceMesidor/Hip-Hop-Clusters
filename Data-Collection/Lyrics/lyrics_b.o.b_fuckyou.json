Can't stand to see a nigga shinin\nNow you under eyein the clique\nHate to see a nigga smile and laugh, fuck you\nHate to see me signing autographs, fuck you\nAll I need, is my voice and sum fire weed\nI don't owe a nigga shit\nAnd I don't ask for you to ride my dick\nHow I'm gonna change? All I know is da streets\nThere's a lot of gutters on my street and a lot of gutter in me\nDon't speak at me, don't wave, ain't no \"Hip Hop Hooray\"\nBy the way, suck a dick, you got some garbage ass ways\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: DG Yola]\nUh, uh, let me speak up so everyone can hear me\nI ain't neva had nuttin, so you all should fear me\nYoung, wild, and ruthless, consider me grown\nEvery man for himself and to each his own\nAnd every since I made a statement, ya bastards couldn't take it\nThats a shame, look at how they obligatin\nHatin, steadily plottin, and wishin for Lil DG's position\nThey just blinded by the lights, ain't payin attention\nTo how I struggled with tha hard, tha green, and tha soft\nAnd how I learned to pay the cost to be the boss\nYou got people that follow people, screaming they need help\nBut I don't need nobody but my god damn self\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d8cefe97bbbe251a84c87f853a533f10.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
