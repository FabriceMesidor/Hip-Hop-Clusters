I'm just kiddin'\nBack to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous\nYou love the way that I stroke it, signin' my name on your neck\nYou used to make potions, playin' round with witchcraft\nI wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'll drink that\n\n[Chorus]\nOur eyes locked, you can see the sadness\nMy heart stops, every time you call my name\nMy jaw drops, you fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck\nYou fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?\nWe're down, we're sad, is it my fault?\nI apologize for all of the lies, oh\nI won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh\n\n[Bridge 2]\nWe met in a Twilight Zone\nI fall apart when she keep me whole\nWe met on the West Coast\nBut I still see Miami in your soul\n\n[Chorus]\nOur eyes locked, you can see the sadness\nMy heart stops, every time you call my name\nMy jaw drops, you fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck\nYou fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?\nWe're down, we're sad, is it my fault?\nI apologize for all of the lies, oh\nI won't, treat you like the rest of them guys, oh\n\n[Outro]\nI'm here to serve a purpose\nGirl, I know I ain't picture perfect\nOne more thing I know for certain\nIf you leave, I'll close the curtains", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
