Stop gobbling liquor and probably consider\nPlottin' some shit up to get popular quicker\nPhonies get too many plays on the station\nAnd leave me assed out of a deal while they on vacation\nShit I'll leave these rappers face on the pavement!\nThis game's filled with more whack niggas then a slave owner's basement\nBut I'm a freth of bresh air\nI mean a breath of fresh air\nMCs are next to catch hell\nI leave 'em wrecked and then scared\nCause that's just what I do\nI'm the lyrical bugaboo\nWait on me for a substitute\nI be tearin' shit up so move!\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey shorty, if I buy you a 40\nYou think that you can gimme some 'tang?

I think so\nI'm the invincible, unpredictable, Mr. Ripper flow\nYes, it's pitiful, gimme some nipples to nibble on\nLyrical general, suck on my genitals\n'Fore you get shitted on\nUnderstand me or we never gon' get along\nHe best be, the hottest since the PS3\nStraight out the W-E-S-T\nOf course! What other rappers you know repping it iller?\nYou other niggas pretty hot but I'm a definite killer\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\n\n[Hook]\nOhh, I'm here!\nSo open up the door for me\n(who is it?)\nIt's Hopsin\nI'm Here\nSo open up the door for me\nHurry up and let me in\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nGive me my dinner\n(Na Na Na Na Na)\nThen pass me the dessert\n\n[Outro]\nHopsin!\nH-izzo, P stepped in the dizzo\nWit' a mean mug and a magnificent flizzo\nH-izzo, P stepped in the dizzo\nWit' a mean mug and a magnificent flizzo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb33e7a89a5050dc08095e21c220cc15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
