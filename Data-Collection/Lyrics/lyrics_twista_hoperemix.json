(Let's go)\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nOh, I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it, let it take you away\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but that's okay\n'Cause we hopeful\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nI wish that you would show some love\nInstead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)\nI wish I could teach the world to sing\nWrite some music and have them trippin' off the joy I bring\nShit - I wish that we can hold hands\nListen instead of dissin', lessons from a grown man (I wish)\nAnd I - wish the families that lack but got love\nGet some stacks, brand new shack, and a 'Lac that's on dubs\nAnd I - wish we could keep achieving wonders\nSee the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder (I wish)\nYou feel me - and I hope all the kids eat\nAnd don't nobody in my family see six feet - ya dig?\nI hope the mothers stand strong\nYou can make it whether you with him or your man's gone (I wish)\nAnd I - wish I could give every celly some commissary\nAnd no popo bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly\nAnd I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again\nAnd bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again\nShit - then one day they can speak again\nI wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN\nI wish we could never get the blues\nWish that I could bring back the people that died at E2\nI wish that we could walk the path, stay doin' the right thing\nHustle hard so them kids maintain up in the game (Let's go)\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nOh, I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it, let it take you away\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but - that's okay\n'Cause we hopeful\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nWish the Earth wasn't so apocalyptic\nI try to spread my message to the world the best way that I can give it\nWe can make it, always be optimistic\nIf you don't listen, gotta live my life the best way that I can live it\nI pray for justice when we go to court\nWish it was all good so the country never even went to war\nWhy can't we kick it and just get 'em on?\nAnd in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?'\nHope we can find a better way to shop in peace\nAnd I - hope we find a better way than coppin' ki's\nAnd I - wish everybody would just stop and freeze\nAnd ask - why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies?\nYou can be wrong if it's you doubtin'\nWith the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains\nAnd only the Heavenly Father can ease the hurt\nJust let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church (Let's go)\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nOh, I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it, let it take you away\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but - that's okay\n'Cause we hopeful\nOh, I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it, let it take you away\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but - that's okay\n'Cause we hopeful\nHopeful, oh, hopeful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c206d86ec9355c4be94277a5cf970fbb.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
