Shit\"\n\"Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch\"\nWent to the store to use the payphone\nCalled up Mack, \"Aiyyo J.D. homey\"\nHung it up and rolled down Dacca\nHeadin for the nigga he was after\nBy the time he arrived at the scene\nMalcolm was ready for anything\nHe tried to sneak around the back way\nNever thought of bein taken out on that day\nBlack boy, black coat\nStood around the corner as he passed slit his throat\nHe didn't fall so he fired\nOne to the middle of his skull, he's expired\nA whole army came out\nTwenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house\nThat how it happens in the Acre\nOne nigga died in the park in the paper\nShit gets deeper but why?\nI guess you only get a minute to pray\nAnd a second to die", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bfc55f1e39dab482dd5f87425202cda6.453x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
