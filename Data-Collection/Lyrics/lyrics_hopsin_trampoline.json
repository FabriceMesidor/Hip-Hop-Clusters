Wack niggas move it aside\nWhen you heard I was a big deal you were surprised\nWest coast bitch, put ya W's in the sky\nI spent my days as a refugee\n'Til the rap game came to rescue me\nAnd left my wrist paved in accessories\nA dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees\nYou're wrong if you thinking Wayne was the recipe\nNah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back\nGet out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch\nSee I prefer to relax but I can't and God knows it\nGotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with\nOh shit, niggas keep fucking with my emotions\nMaybe that's the reason that I suffer from psychosis\nShocking as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless\nSo I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this\n\n[Hook]\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\n\n[Verse 2]\nBounce like a trampoline, thousands that's amped as me\nKids run up on your school campus slap a dean\nI grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams\nMoral of my damn story life, isn't a happy scene\nWish I was stacking cream, wish I had a Lamborghini\nWish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine\nI'm sick of the radio playing all these faggot teens\nKeep it real, show me something ill that I haven't seen\nFor ten years I've been working on ill flows\nAnd finally got a fucking record deal and I'm still broke\nMan that's not common, bombs that I'm dropping\nAre dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen\nI notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats\nI should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse\nNo more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that\nIt's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached\nCome on\n\n[Hook]\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm the last of a dying breed, Hip-Hop lacks a variety\nThat's the reason I thrash on society\nI get laughed at when I clash with a robbery\nUntil they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty\nBut I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same kid\nUp on the same shit, rapping in the basement\nCatch me at your local school, skating, busting tre flips\nLeft shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get\nListen while the bass hit, the only thing that changed is\nThe way that girls act, 'cause now they think I'm amazing\nI used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with\nSitting alone with a Capri Sun and raisins\nMy senior year in highschool I was always truant\nHad a lot of homework but I would never do it\nScrew it, I'm the king now, homie take a bow\nYou need the crowd jumping? I could probably make 'em bounce\n\n[Hook]\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline\nHop can probably make them bounce\nHop can probably make them bounce\nLike a trampoline", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
