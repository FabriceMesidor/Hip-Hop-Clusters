Homie got fucked up\nTryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what\nOr who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo\nPick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!\nOnce upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)\nI tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)\nThat's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody\nSwitch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me\nThey liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him\nThey worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian\nThe beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than\nA great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium\n\n[Hook: Justus (Dr. Dre)]\n(Don't get it fucked up) Been away from home\nBeen away from home all night long\n(All they wanna know is: where you from?\nWhere you from, nigga, huh?
