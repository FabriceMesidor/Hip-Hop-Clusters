(never say my name)\nI can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?\nMake you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am\nI showed you a million, no videos (no videos)\nI opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)\nBodies droppin' and we duckin' the law\nIf you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nThey take my kindness for weakness\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nTake my kindness for weakness\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\n\n[Verse 3: Future]\nPluto don't dance, but I make moves\nWe fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you\nShameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too\nTold me, \"Boy I think the money startin' to change you\"\nLord save you, Lord save you\nThey might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall\nYou must not know who I am\nYou must not know who I am\nI pour champagne on the ground\nI pour champagne on the ground\nMy brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)\nAnd at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')\nYou turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)\nI call for loyalty, she didn't never answer\nI'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)\nYou're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies\n(so familiar)\nI got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy\nYou try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded\nBe honest to me\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]\nThey take my kindness for weakness\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nBe honest to me\nTake my kindness for weakness\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\nStill comin' out strong\n\n[Outro: The Weeknd & Future]\nKindness, she lie\nStill comin', lie\nBoss, fuck around, boss\nKindness\nDown, like a nigga, she lie\nKindness, she lie\nKindness, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a3334b3b040c2c12cf716402693c55af.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
