Strong social critiques thru thoughtful comedic jabs?\nBut you'd rather do \"yo mama\" jokes cause some heckler got you mad\nI hate to break the news, but I love that it will be spoke\nYou didn't take your comedy seriously, so now YOU are the fucking joke!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
