I wish it was\n\nCause I ain't shit\nYou may think I'm eating\nBut I ain't shit\nNaw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nIn ninth grade I started off on the right track\nGot a few A's but then I bounced right back\nWasn't aware my main thought was what I should wear\nNow that I think about it nobody really cared\nI grew up in the church but barely paid attention\nRead up on Malcolm X and started questioning religion\nBecame a rebel\nI still believe in God\nI just doubt the authenticity of Jesus and the Devil\nI got my first car and started smoking black and milds\nThe smell is like a bell in Hades, hella loud\nThen it was Newports and Kools on my way to school\nMy girl hated it but still kissed me in the mouth\nI started ditching class more than I attended\nI was walking a path that I had not intended\nIt looked as though I was mad, becoming relentless\nMy mamma couldn't tell me nothing\nEnd of discussion\n\nI ain't shit\nI ain't attracting no flies man I ain't shit\nNaw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit\n\n[Hook]\nCause I ain't shit\nYou may think I'm eating\nBut I ain't shit\nNaw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit\n\n[Verse 3: Ab- Soul]\nI got kicked out, crept back in\nIf I wasn't fucking I was fussing with my step-dad again\nOh yeah I rapped, didn't take it that serious\nBut I flowed like an ocean among my peers\nDreams of going off to college in my younger years\nThen the whole thought of it sounded nuts I had dumbo ears\nDid about a semester then I was outta there\nSaid if I get one song on radio, I'm outta here\nKnowing that low ratio of successful entertainers\nI choose a goal, people with skulls would say was brainless\nStarted smoking weed as soon as purple kush was famous\nShifting my setting eventually as I went through changes\nPeople I seen my whole life appeared to me as strangers\nCreated a voice through my music and now they speak my language\nI was in a Jay Rock video for less than 15 seconds\nAll of a sudden niggas that I looked up to see me as a legend\nNow I step in clubs and sidity bitches give me hugs\nBut back in P.E. tennis a nigga got zero love\nI'm just a hard headed loser\nMy mamma was trying to save me from stalling out my future\n\nCause I ain't shit\nI don't need no toilet paper man I ain't shit\nNaw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3i84smrrrfrufn8smf94khgv.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
