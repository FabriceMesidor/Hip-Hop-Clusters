Read Ayn Rand\nThen you'll understand why they call me the man\nI'm just fucking special-er\nDifferent from you other guys\nHating me in high school made me metamorphosize\nKafka-esque, The way I dress\nI need to send Bo Diddley some checks\nOn Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie\nDiddy is my swagger coach, can't stop, won't stop\nHeavy hitter, short stop, horse face, horse cock\nBouncer, door stop, tell me when enough's enough\nLooking at me warming up, microwave a nigga flow\nPity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know\nI get it like I gotta, man, Flier like a college band\nNiggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man\nDrinking fucking grape juice, early at a wine bar\nBlacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star", "image": "https://images.genius.com/71b32f259d92f0db0dfeba38136bbd3e.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
