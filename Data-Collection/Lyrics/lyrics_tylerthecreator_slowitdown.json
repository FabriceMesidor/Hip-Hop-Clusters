Yeah\nTurn it up, nigga where's the bass?\nDrop the drums\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]\nPink chinchilla, something like thrilla\nMy t-shirts are bathing, a bathing gorilla\nYou niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda\nBut I ate the whole plate like a fat bitch dinner\nI'm never the winner, always the loser\nI don't choose to win, but I will choose her\nHer kitty-cat fish loves his tuna\nI never use a fork I always spoon her\nGo nuts, instrumental flow much\nEuropean model white bitch is eating donuts\nFuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch\nMaking shit come like I'm go-go gadget\nI'm mental, it's instrumental\nMake your bitches' therapist ask for dental records\nAnd I hope this record have you stabbing niggas with colored pencils\n\n[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, yeah\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, oh my God\nTurn it up nigga, where's the bass?\nCould you bring the keys? Yeah\nTurn it up, nigga where's the bass?\nDrop the drums\n\n[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]\nYo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces\nYou fail at life, I'll mug your teachers\nI've got Muslims calling on Jesus\nI fucked Kelly, where is Regis?\nFound Alicia, now she keyless\nCold as ice, and now I'm creamless\nMurdered every bod from my squad\nSo technically, now I'm teamless, O.F. is so prestigious", "image": "https://images.genius.com/233f9573ead55dd88a580f888cbf3b48.700x700x1.png"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
