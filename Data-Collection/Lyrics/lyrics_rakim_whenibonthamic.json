Knock it down\nLumberjack style, baby; extra wood\nRock it all night long, the bang-a-thon baby\nKeep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on\nDon't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style\nShow her the town, steal her heart, no money down\n\n[Chorus]\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known, yo\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nSo all hail the honorable\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow about some hardcore? Yeah, we like it raw for sure\nBroads on the floor, wall to wall\nThere's more at the door, players ball to score\n\u2018Cause this right here is for all of y'all\nRakim and Primo; yo, I got what you need, bro\nYou go see a show, smoke an L, mean yo\nAnd DJ's play hits with hard bass kicks\nAnd then they display tricks, like The Matrix\nMake the record fly undetected by the naked eye\nSo just feel the vibe, \u2018cause your ears never lie\nNowadays DJ's bags of tricks, graphic\nOn some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it\nClassic, this kid got his craft mastered\nHands is mad quick, like he mix with magic\nSpin it back and forth and grab it\nAnd know just where it is\u2026 there it is\n\n[Chorus]\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known, yo\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nSo all hail the honorable\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques\nI hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks\nThey be like: \"How that kid Ra reach the peak?\"\nPull out the heat and use my technique to speak\nIt's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids\nWhat part of the game this is in foreign languages\nThey hold Ra's events in different continents\nPut my lyrical contents in monuments\nIn ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh\nMind travel, design style like apparel\nMy fashions last long as a lifetime\n\u2018Cause I can see the future when the god write rhymes\nThey're mad \u2018cause I managed to reign so long\nLike their chance to make money done came and gone\nThis is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night\nAnd the sisters that be keepin' this right, when I be on the mic\n\n[Chorus]\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known, yo\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nI'm internationally known when I be on the mic\nHardcore, real ill niggas\nSo all hail the honorable", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd17be8618880a89d768965323b6d66b.600x567x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
