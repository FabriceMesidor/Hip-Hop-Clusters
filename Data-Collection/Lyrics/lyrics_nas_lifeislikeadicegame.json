I never knock a brother, I'm anti-jail for real\nSmooth criminal skill, locked in a human flesh shield\nWatching niggas get rich beside me\nPushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat\nBut I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom\nSipping Asti Spumante, dripped in, reality kicks in\nI need the papes to start clicking\nGot a connect out in Richmond, ain't nigga in the fam will pitch in\nIt's on, word is bond, that's my name, big Nas, all wise to civilize\nFrom the Northern Hemisphere of the earth\nPeace to my seed and thanks for her birth\nDestiny, that's her name\nIt's going on, you know my name\nBig Nas in the house, y'all, on the freestyle tip\nWhen I finish this shit, it's sure to be a hit\nPeace, peace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d5180486c5864bcc94ba79789630f59.268x268x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
