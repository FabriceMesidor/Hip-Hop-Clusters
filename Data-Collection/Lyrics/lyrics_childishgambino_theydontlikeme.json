That's unnecessary\nI don't quit for shit, that's my legendary\n\n[Outro: Sample]\nOh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me\nOh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me\nOh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me\nOh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/587833871590a682c8aed1b739f0cb23.906x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
