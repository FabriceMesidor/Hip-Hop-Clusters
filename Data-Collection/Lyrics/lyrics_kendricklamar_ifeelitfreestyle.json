Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly\nUh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh\nWho say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?\nI'm 'bout to give you a prime example\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhere my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?\nWhere my nickels and dimes at?\n.45's Mac 10's and nines at?\n9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat\nIf its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer\nYou wanna die? I can help you\nPut the rap beef aside and [?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised\nI'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime\nMike Jordan in his heyday\nCall me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines\nI'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred\nUncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas\nGrandpa moved to Mississippi\nI really can't tell if dude missed me\nProbably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe\nMore reason why my heart cold\nPrior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio\nWe tryna do songs, but they ain't listen\nThey just kick down the door as if they have permission\nWhy you had to do that for?\nI wish Pro Tools was on record\nWish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something\nNo assumptions, I know I'm nice\nI know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass\nNot Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan\nChokin' the mic, releasing my frustration\nRather do that before I catch court cases\nLocked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic\nBoxed in like a new Porsche rollin'\nStones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen\nK. Dot's in my colon\nThat nigga, Colon Powell\nModern day war victim\nOh, I'm foul, come join my coalition\nNo snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant\nFeel relentless, new apprentice\nKing of, comprehension\nNo competition\nCompton's back, pump your fist like this and that\nNo sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts\nYou're a disgrace to this rap business\nJust a one-man office, you need assistance\nGun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors\nI am a senseless thug, with book smarts\nAnd anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question\nWe gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession\nGave you the rhyme scheme before you're English-education\nExclamation, put it in quotes\nI say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag\nThe flow, the artist development\nAm I who gave you the growth?\nYou didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed\nThe sun shine, and now king me\nThe rapper's rapper, the MC's MC\nKodak moment that's been captured, cheese\nI said cheese", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0d736130ef89ba0b866b3b01fad325c1.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
