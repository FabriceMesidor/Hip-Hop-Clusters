So here we go\nI'm tired of the money talk and the, bitches and hoes\nEverybody's always, soundin the same\nI have to walk on water I can't, drown in the game\n\n[Hook 2X: scratched samples]\n\"Hip-Hop, was set out in the dark\" {*3X*}\n\"They used to do it out in the park\"\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI remember your bar mitzvah, that burgundy label\nMe and Jam Master had the battle of the big cables\nBefore the Serratos, real vinyls, real tables\nSkills was the motto, no hype, no fables\nYou seemed so happy, you loved me so much\nYou popped off and went platinum, at my slightest touch\nOversized hoodies, Yukon trucks\n20 years later, it's like lightning struck\nThey're worshipin the money, they're prayin to the bank\nThey danced on slaveship, slept as it sank\nThe devil made 'em do it, but only God do I thank\nBecause we aren't done yet, there's still gas in the tank\nYou look in a man's eyes, that's how you really tell his rank\nNot the size of his account, check him, he might bounce\nIt's all on the line, this time it really counts\nI'll bleed for this one, on down to the last ounce\n\n[Hook]\n\n[LL Cool J]\nThey rent a crib they're frontin, they rent a car they're stuntin\nThey rent a chain they're bluffin, that's why the culture's sufferin\nAnd even if you're a millionaire that don't mean nothin\nUnless you build your community and encourage some unity\nToo much ego... too much posin\nIf he's so hot then, why's the culture frozen?\nIt's time for a change, the order needs to be rearranged\nAnd this song was pre-ordained\nAfter 2 long decades, LL still remains\nAnd you can blame it on my spirit, not on my brains\nTime to put on my armor, go to war for the game\nCause it's on its last leg, and that's more than a shame\nThis is a lifestyle homey, it's more than champagne\nBut I will make a toast to Flash reachin the Hall of Fame\nI end it with a line, from the book of King James\nLet there be light when I write graffiti on the train\n\n[Hook]\n\n[LL Cool J - repeat 2X]\nLet us proclaim the mystery and fame\nI pray the Lord my culture be saved\nIf hip-hop dies before I awake\nMay Jam Master Jay cut a LL break", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
