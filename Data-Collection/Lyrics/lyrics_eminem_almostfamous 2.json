Chang's sauce?\nGame's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls\nYou think I'm backin' down?\nYou must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again\nI'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen\nMetaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory\nSome I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win\nPullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's\nNot even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?\nAnd tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko\n'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch\nNow get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick\nGet off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!\nDon't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer\nI just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer\nI just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast\nBeat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer\nY'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes\nSee, he's in a whole nother weight class\nHe's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets\nYou're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite\nNow he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties\nNo peace treaties, he's turned into a beast\nHis new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E\nHe's almost famous\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nNow there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls\nScreamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls\nSpewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads\nHe ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard\nHe'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark\nWith the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, \"Ahh!\"\nThese metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all\nIf they don't like it, they can all get fucked\nInstead of suckin' him off\nThey can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by\nLike David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die\nAnd eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it\nHe's mad at the whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'\nWho coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?\nAnd while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these women's been lowered\nSo bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'\nThis world ain't gonna know what hit it\nHe did it, he made it, he's finally famous", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8267d6f45cdffed8db78f53fa00991c5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
