Then 7/25/06 came. IMM ranges in different styles and sounds and I believe that's why I gravitated to it so much. The upright bassline on \u201cCan I Have It Like That\u201d or the buckets on \u201cHow Does It Feel\u201d. Off the wall MJ on \u201cNumber 1\u2033. I still to this day don't think I can make a song better than \u201cThat Girl\u201d. And \u201cI Really Like You Girl\u201d is easily the best song on this album with your best Timberlake impersonation and Stevie harmonica. IMM also includes \u201cRaspy Shit\u201d which is the worst song in your discography I hate that song so much you are so gross for that. But the one that stood out was \u201cYou Can Do It Too\u201d. The sade bassline, the string pad with chords that you claim only Q-Tip, you and I like, the Jamie Cullum outro!\n\nBeing 15 black not really \u201cinterested\u201d in what the majority of my peers were into, it made me feel safe. I was optimistic, always daydreaming and setting goals so I felt you were directly speaking to me. I remember clancy telling me how Jimmy Iovine thought this album was a \u201ccomplete fucking failure it didnt work\u201d. But see, it did, just not on the kids he was looking at. The ones who just existed; used the popular slang; listened to what was thrown at them; dressed in clothing that was trending at the time. Not saying that's bad but of course this wouldn't work on them. But it worked on me and I created Odd Future that same summer. I was actually naive enough to believe you and thought I could do all these amazing things if I really tried.\n\nWhere I grew up, niggas get stuck and never make it out. Jail, dead, shit jobs, not really growing. It seems like at a certain age, ideas; original thoughts are no longer a thing; I didnt fall into that cycle. I\u2019m now a young entrepreneur all because I believed you when you said I could be. You were the first person I contacted when I pulled off that McLaren dealership!\n\nThis is getting long so uhhh, hbd IMM. I never had brothers, uncles or my father around so thank you for being the male figure I gravitated to. Allowing me to embrace being different and trusting my ideas.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4eb6a381e7a33a7f7eab04ee3f47297d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
