Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite\nKeep my foes and my enemies and the ones that pretend to be (Close to me)\nCause honestly them the ones that'll hinder me\nSo henceforth remember me, this voice is finna be\nHis choice of energy, by him I mean all men\nParty like it's 1999, smoke my wood tip wine\nGiving all my things to God then say \"Amen\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]\n'Till summer's here and if the winter comes, to great days turn to yellow ones\nI stay grinding for mine, I tried to tell 'em once\nTo travel to the moon you gotta face the elements\nAnd battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants\nIt's elementary, I speak with a certain eloquence\nI smoke hella blunts, a habit I been developed since\nI was a young boy playing the silver ball\nSee 'em stand, feel 'em fall, Metallica, kill 'em all\nHuh, living like this is my last moment\nBut a moment could last forever\nSnap a picture and Nat Cole it\nGet whatever you gon' sip in your glass, hold it up\nHit the side on mine, get to tipping it back, throw in\nSo many days we was sitting low, better get busy living 'till the day\nYou giving in and get to go where the sinners go\nPulling the cash and spend it slow\nGotta make it fast, but them should know\nMatter no money yo, it's all expendable\nUbi out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Godemis]\nHold your breath, count to three I'mma kill it\nKiller commitee, city chairman\nStrapped with a gramma Glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin\nThree round burst, I'm aiming at your brain\nSpin it, when I cock it I kiss it and call it Sara Jay\nLiving like I'm going down tomorrow, sit down and drown in a bottle\nGo out and get another bottle\nI don't lead I don't follow, If I don't eat I get hollow\nI don't even play lotto, see chief I need every dollar\nY'all don't see me with a model or rockin' a lot of Prada\nI don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana\nFuck it I call it karma if I wake up in Nirvana\nBlood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow\nShit, I live in the moment and pardon every opponent who pass\nBut I put the pedal to the metal, I got both feet on the gas\nThis could be the last verse that I'm writing, like it or not\nEverybody's taking a rob and they put you right in a box\n\n[Interlude: Tech N9ne]\nWohoo!
