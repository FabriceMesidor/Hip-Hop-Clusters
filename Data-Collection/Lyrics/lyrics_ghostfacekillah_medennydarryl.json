My persona, man, it's nada, this is not a thing\nIsland got Italians, load the Talons and then bada-bing\nMake 'em sing, this is not Sopranos, y'all, don't make a scene\nMaking cream, how I make it up without the Maybelline?\nCan' with the laser beam, your favorite team's\nNot the playground to play around with, just try and take a swing\nYadamean? It's not a seesaw battle\nNot the bridge you wanna travel\n'Cause your life expectancy on the Verrazzano is narrow\nJust me, Denny and Darryl\nJust before my hand cock you can see the Smith on the barrel\nHit the gravel, forever be in my shadow\nRather be up in the saddle than up the creek with no paddle\nKey to the city, judge, throw away the gavel\nSince the game got pretty it don't go with my apparel", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5d29f854228aa112356a7c3a84f5cd4e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
