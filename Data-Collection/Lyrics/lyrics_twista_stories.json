(Whomp)\nAight, well check it out\nWon't you tell these muthafuckaz a lil' bit about where you come from\n\n[Fiend]\nFire arms, sounds of alarms\nConsistency in bodily harm\nWhere I'm from that's the norm\nFiend the ?\nLil' nigga ain't no man of creaton\nOnce we encounter the killin' spree we on\nMy defects have G's bet on\nNiggas dollars get they rep on\nSpeakin' with heat ? could bring death on\nNigga I'm called the killa\nCause every time he get it, it brought chills\nLead that's what made 'em take his ass for real\nI done ? survivor\nHe never wrote the name of his drivers\nAnd wondered that the man can deprive ya\nIt's there in black ink\nWith millions in dirty green had to think\nLives depreciated over drinks\nCall me twisted\nRope burns to the neck was insisted\nAnd all his hope turned to \"I guess should I risk it?\"\n[Fiend talkin]\nAnd that's why the law is laid down\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nFrom Fiend to N.O. to Chi, Twista\nPimp run it now\n\n[Hook - Fiend (Oobie)]\nNow to my hustlaz slangin' cain\nI said some survive the game\nSome just get they names in the stories to be told\nWhy the young never make it old\nNow to my hustlaz slangin' cain\nI said some survive the game\nSome just get they names in the stories to be told\nWhy the young never make it old (Why the young never make it old)\n\n[Liffy Stokes]\nI live my life drownin' in homicide\nNever let the drama slide\nWe killaz quick to let it ride\nSend a nigga beddy-by when I let it fly\nNiggas be yappin' but they scared to die\nTalkin' plenty shit till I cap off with the .45\nLook into these smoke red eyes, feel me starvin'\nFeel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment\nAnd picture me on top of the world and still servin'\nBlessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'\nAs long as my hood is tight, my mind is right\nLook at the dope line tonight, just doin' aight\nFor the nugs\nY'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug\nThis struggle for power keeps us all up to no good\nWith constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's\nWith the itchy sittin' dead on the seat\nFor the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down\nFor this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rid-ounds\n\nHook\n\n[Twista]\nNever thought that the cries of my people would get louder\nWhen Chief first came home with that glistenin' white powder\nBut it gave us power\nNever thought them ? packs that had us buyin' clothes and pullin' hoes\nWould have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes\n(That's how it goes)\nAnd who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit\nThat we would end up gettin' our whole block lit\nBy-standers got hit up\nAnd who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights\nLightin' pilot lights\nI would be crept on my a mask on silent nights\nNow I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack off his merch\nFlip a new Lac with his work\nEnd up in the back of hearse\nThen be packed in the dirt\nFlaked over turf, can you hear the Mack when it 'sperse\nHe get cracked where it hurts\nFeel the automatic when it jerks\nComin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk\nIs that what it's worth naw, niggas got the chrome and TV's in the whip\nKnowing that the law got his name on the list\nBet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks\nYou ain't on yo P's, you gotta be\nFuck a sure strategy, don't be punked like no lame\nYou just a pawn in the game\nSteady baggin' work, hittin' licks, and stackin' cain'\n\nHook", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b61c84cf38b4d4f2133ce851fe5c6b1c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
