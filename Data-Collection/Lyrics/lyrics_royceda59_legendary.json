My niggas clock around the party\nAround the clock, wearing choppers 'round the .40\nAnd rocket launcher down the block\nMwah! And they ain't got no lawyers\nThat gon make 'em fuckin' legendary\nThat's gon make you fucking legendary\nBeautiful women asking \"When we gon' get together?\"\nI told all 'em bitches \"Nevuary\"\nNow all them baddest bitches know to never come to me with nonsense\n'Cause they know that I will fuck 'em once\nLike a record company then drop 'em\nHold up, that's that shit gon make you legendary\nThat shit gon make me so, so, so legendary\n'Specially if she acting suspect\nAnd the pussy just end up being so, so\nI'm just a superhuman being with the quickest slow flow\nGot the underground wire, like the tires low pro\nGot the eye of the tiger inside of the mind of a, old soul, yo\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't no better feeling\nThan turning down you a bad one\nThat right there gon make you legendary\nThat right there gon make you legendary\nIt ain't no better feeling\nThan turning down you a bad bitch\nThat's that shit gon make you legendary\nThat's that shit gon make you legendary\n\n[Outro]\nThat's that shit gon make you legendary\nThat's that shit gon make you legendary\nYou get more for your money when you fuck with Mr. Porter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ece0d83dced13a6ca8fbcbc25cfd032f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
