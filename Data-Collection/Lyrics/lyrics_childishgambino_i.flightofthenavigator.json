We almost lost it\nWhen you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see\nAnd we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance\nTo tell you that I haven't been\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWe are all cold water\nWhy try at all? Why bother?\n\n[Hook]\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this\nIt would be some type of meanness to where you are\n'Cause I don't know where to go\nAnd no one else seems to know\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWe are all night's fallen\nWhy try at all? Dark calling\nSo we're left alone, no one left to call upon\nBe still now, broken bones, as I travel on\n\n[Hook]\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nHold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nSo we're left alone, no one left to call upon\nBe still my broken bones, as I travel on\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\nJust hold me close, my darling\n\n[Outro]\nCold wa-\nCold wa-", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b8c1f5981bc77ffd06580a1f2e693cf3.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
