Cause that head is stupid\nLotta people suckin' dick, but you can execute it\nPerfect timing, don't you add another second to it\nDon't you ever-ever-ever-ever-ever do it\nYeah, head pollution, conflict resolution\nKeep it true, everything that I do with you\nI ain't here to break a promise\nI'm just tryna keep it honest, and honestly\n\n[Hook: Njomza]\nTell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nShow me you, show me you, show me you\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nTell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\nShow me you, show me you, show me you\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\n\n[Outro: Njomza & Mac Miller]\nDon't have to pretend\nWe both know how it ends\nI just need your presence\nWanna feel you feel me\nYou just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn\nWanna feel you feel me\nWanna feel you feel me\nYou just landed from the Planet God Damn, damn\nWanna feel you feel me\nWanna feel you feel me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b039f6866294506ae42378217870e464.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
