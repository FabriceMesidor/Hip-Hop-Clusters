Now depression creep\nI'm stressing deep, even in my sleep\nMy mommy call, I hit ignore\nMy daughter calls, I press ignore\nMy chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor\nI'm blanking out, woke up on the couch\nDinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts\nI had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse\nI cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved\nMy senses harmed, sluggish ruggish\nA couple Xannies popped, open my pill box (Prescription drugs)\n\n[Interlude: Joy]\nWhat's wrong, daddy?!\nWake up!\nWake up!\n\n[Verse 2]\nPrescription drugs, I fell in love\nMy little secret, she gon' kill a thug\nMy body numb, she like to give me hugs\nI love her touch, I get a rush\nWhen she don't come around, I start to go nuts\nMy heart erupts, I'm curled in pain\nMy phone ring, ring and ring and ring\nIf you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing\nMay 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time\nHe said \"Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes\"\nI don't decline, at least that's in my mind\nGrab the keys, need some woods for the trees\nDap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC\nContinue right, remember seeing light\nWise night, but that's my life (Prescription drugs)\n\n[Outro: Joy]\nWhat's wrong?\nYou tired?\nYou mad?\nOkay, I love you, daddy\n\n[Produced by Sounwave]\n\nPart 2: \"Oxymoron\"\n\n[Intro]\nUh, let me get some there for 20 dollars watch, 20 dollars\nYou can get one for 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 whatever nigga\nSeattle what up?
