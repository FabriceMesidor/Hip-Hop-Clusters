Slap your soft ass to the floor\nAnd watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door\nI ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this\nIt's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!\n\n[Hook: E.D.I.]\nWe goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out\nTake them the war route, without a doubt\nBall, which means we all ride if it's on\nEach nigga handle your own, bring it on strong\nIf you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out\nBustas playin' with your papes better go all out\nTryna see the next day, nigga, go all out\nObstacles in your way, you better go all out\n\n[Verse 3: Kastro]\nNow, we all ride, and down to die \u2014 who with us?\nSpeak up or get treated like you comin' to kill us\nThey ain\u2019t nothin' but squealers\nIn this rap game, swearin' they rough\nTattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac\nStop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya\nThese Glocks hot, and when shot it'll bring the bitch up out ya\nIt's me, Kastro with the goattee, walkin' like a OG\n\u2018Cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me\nI pray to thug lords like them motherfuckers holy\nFrontline soldier, 'til the Heavens call me\nI go all out, and if you real, you real\nFeel what I'm talkin' 'bout, \u2018cause this game is ill\nI live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it\nLivin' proof, Pac breed niggas they can't deal with\nHolla back, right back, and watch your mouth\nOr get blood in it, what!
