Come on, quit the yapping\nThere's no justification for the way that I be acting\nI be asking for forgiveness, now you wanna end this?\nI'm clean as a whistle, I promise I won't hit you but I still do\nEvery five minutes I'm calling you\nI'm psycho, I might go nuts that's why I follow you\nI wasn't showed affection, I fuck you rough, cause all I know is my erection\n(Enough is enough!) See it's tough, but you don't think I hit another nigga\nHe'll be tied up, looking at me licking on your picture\nI'mma pop your sister, then go for self\nCause if I can't have you, shit, can't nobody else\nI'm rebellious, remain the scandalous\n2 of the room in anger management, bitch I can't handle it\nFuck it, I hate you\nFuck it, I love you\n\n[Hook]\nYou make me wanna cry, suicide is on my mind\nYou beat me all the time, I wanna die\nYou make me wanna cry, suicide is on my mind\nYou beat me all the time, I wanna die\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nWho the fuck gives a fuck about a foster child?\nTwo years old, left at Belle Isle\nMy life's so fucking bad\nNever had a mom and dad\nShit I'm surprised I ain't a fag\nTo release anger, I learned how to box\nGot my ass kicked while the whole neighborhood watched\nNow who the fuck gonna hire a laid off mechanic\nRecovering drug addict, gets so crazed he's schizophrenic\nMe and my mom, we lived in a trailer\nShe died 6 months ago, I still fucking hate her\nShit I hate me, I hate my fucking life\nThat's why every night I beat the shit out of my wife\nTo fight the demons, Bizarre stay high\nThat's why my son go to school with a fucking black eye\nSee my little boy, run up and hug him\nSee you in hell, tell D12 I love'em\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3: Proof]\nIt's like my eyes getting bigger and this wall's closing in\nClosest friends telling me it's all supposed to end\nI done brought you diseases that I caught from the skeezers\nEven talked to the preacher he said it costs to see Jesus\nI know I need work, only way you leave me if you leave earth\nAnd I rather not breathe first\nShaun Holt always remain open, never die alone, shit\nI know you hear me crying Lord\nYou gave me drugs and choices of girls\nGod you made me and played the biggest joke on the world\nLady I'm in the rap, maybe Shady that, I went and had a baby behind your back, I'm sorry\nYou don't wanna live, I don't need to live\nBut you must understand I die without them, I need my kids\nAlthough I fight to like you, but I bite this rifle\nPull the trigger, cause I ain't living this life without you\n\n[Hook:]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ee35f41ed149c86d6fe47f68d55c39e1.450x450x1.gif"}], "artist": "D12"}
