Ain't nuttin' new but the gear\nThe crew of the year, kid too much to bear\nFind out what I'm about, know the legend\nThe slight disrespect of his name provoke tension\nNo threat, bringin' the force like Boba Fett\nThe old vet whose presence alone control the set\nI'm next level, ya best settle, bless Rebel\nI shine like a bezel, with strength to bend metal\n\"Plunge head first in the grunge, become emerged the drums\nThe verse is murder one\n\n[Verse 3: GZA]\nWe rhyme back-to-back, dangerous emcees\nMove on track-to-track 100 bar measure\nLost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure\nAgreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood\nEventually they would\nLay down the trademark with god that built wealth\nTo dip-dive in the beehive was on self\nFor the power struggle, never clown but did juggle\nThe heavy load made it explode to mad rubble\nI thought of this tune on a blackout guided by the light of the moon\nOn a camp-out, the kerosene lamp out\nSo we walked the road we paved\nWith trails that left vinyl footsteps engraved", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6eec7781b61d16cab75a144ab36ff78d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
