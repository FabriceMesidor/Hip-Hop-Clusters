The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.\n\nJUNGLE\n\n??: What's the day today?\n??: October 2nd, 2008\n??: I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009 and see if we can get in this thing without ID (?)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8e4af9d70633a1703ccd3faf671871c.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
