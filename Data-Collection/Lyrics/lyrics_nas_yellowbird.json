When he can have whoever he wants for company?\"\nThe like, \"he a slut, he a ho, he a freak\nHe my childhood crush, wish I met him '03\nNow I need a simple life with a Christian man\"\nI was like, fuck it, get this money, get this power, keep slutting\nThen I bumped into a cutie, looking at her\nNot in a lusted matter, but in we need an introduction matter\nNeed her like fresh water from the springs of Florida\nShe hot for reasons more than one\nUnderneath the balling sun in Coachella where a I met her\nShe was staring\nSince we began to hang, she my number one thing\nTell me your troubles, I'll listen, I'll try to numb your pain\nYou like to hug a king, I call you the color queen\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh burn me love, it's not a drug nor complexion necessarily\nIt's an expression the canary sings\nIf that canary don't sing, I train her\nOn the wings of love, I took the top from the Wrangler\nShe riding shotgun with her shades on, a day will come\nI'll put a natural yellow rock on your finger\nBorn a queen, love looking at you, smile made me change up\nYou a bright sunny morning, sex, amazing\nI said it since day one, we was meant to be\nWhen you put my clothes on and started posing like a G\nPlayfully with my chain then you liked what you see\nLoving how daddy do it, no one quite like me\nNo games, no side chicks, me and my ride or die chick\nWe see eye to eye, maybe not when your heels are five inch\nYou so fly, you so mine, it's me you dine with\nFucking Nas with, later on we spawn\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23061dd2dc7e863127db561906debd27.434x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
