Cole]\nYeah, I got some niggas that still owe me an apology\nI'ma be the bigger man just like I always be\nEventually but right now that's hard for me\nI'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty\nSo I'ma see you when I see you, know that day comin'\nI pray that on that day you slip and say something\nI never fantasize 'bout murder 'cause I'm still sane\nBut I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain\nI know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me\nI know the punishment for you is that you not with me\nYou place your value on the bitches that you got with me\nAnd now the bitches ask you daily \"Why you not with me?\"\nI had to cut some people off 'cause they was using me\nMy heart is big, I want to give too much and usually\nI send the bread and don't hear back for like two months now\nYou hit my phone, you need a loan, oh I'm a crutch now\nI had to learn, I never had shit\nYou never would split, you was hood rich\nI couldn't get a dollar from you I remember that\nIt was blurry for a while but now it's coming back (coming back)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]\nTime will tell who is on my side\n(Time will tell just who is on my side)\nI mean well but I can't stop my pride\n(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)\n\n[Chorus: kiLL edward]\nGimme drink, gimme smoke\nGet me high, let me float\nI'm a cloud, comin' down\nPut me down, gentle now\nGimme drink, gimme dope\nBottom line, I can't cope\nIf I die, I don't know\nI don't know, I don't know\nGimme drink, gimme smoke\nGet me high, let me float\nI'm a cloud, comin' down\nPut me down, gentle now\nGimme drink, gimme dope\nBottom line, I can't cope\nIf I die, I don't know\nI don't know, I don't know\n\n[Bridge: kiLL edward]\nKeep on fallin' down\nKeep on fallin' down\nKeep on fallin' down\nI know Heaven is a mind state, I've been a couple times\nStuck in my ways so I keep on fallin' down\nKeep on fallin' down, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: kiLL edward]\nTime will tell who is on my side\n(Time will tell just who is on my side)\nI mean well but I can't stop my pride\n(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)\n\n[Chorus: kiLL edward]\nGimme drink, gimme smoke\nGet me high, let me float\nI'm a cloud, comin' down\nPut me down, gentle now\nGimme drink, gimme dope\nBottom line, I can't cope\nIf I die, I don't know\nI don't know, I don't know\nGimme drink, gimme smoke\nGet me high, let me float\nI'm a cloud, comin' down\nPut me down, gentle now\nGimme drink, gimme dope\nBottom line, I can't cope\nIf I die, I don't know\nI don't know, I don't know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5cdf2147b92170e674f6809e259cc36f.440x440x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
