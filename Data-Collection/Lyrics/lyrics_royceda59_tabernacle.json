Baby, go see\"\nI walk away feeling like a good father, the same time as a terrible son\nGet to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so I waited\nShe got to get to 'bout nine 'til it's that time\nAnd meanwhile I'm more popular in this hospital than the doctors\nNurses watching, whispering like \"That's the one right there\nWho got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5\"\n\n[Interlude]\nBy this time I don't even fuckin' remember that I got a show\nSomebody had to remind me, the doors was already open at the venue\nI got emotions runnin' every which way\nAll the nurses and stuff is like, \"We'll keep you posted about the baby\nWe'll keep you posted about your granny.\"\nI didn't like seeing my mama like that, so I had to get out of there\n\n[Verse 4]\nYeah, I hit the stage at 11:50, killed it\nI got off at about midnight with about six types\nOf different emotions floatin' around inside me\nHopeless, tryna find me, hopin' in time God'll guide me\nIn the future, just as I was about to leave out\nI saw Kino talkin' to Marshall and then he introduced us\nWe talked about collaboratin' and how chasin' this rap thing is aggravatin'\nBut I'll get back, I got the family waitin'\nI get to skatin'\nAs soon as I get to the hospital, they tell me that my granny didn't make it\nShe just died, I'm feelin' helpless, it hurt me\nOn the flip side, my little boy is healthy in the nursery\nI picked him up, looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried\nAin't no denyin' this is the power of God\nI said, \"I love you, Granny\" and looked to the sky\nLike even though he just got here, goodbye\n\n[Outro]\nThis is how the story goes\nPowerful day (now you know) powerful day (now you know)\nMost significant day in my life\nI mean aside from meetin' my man Marshall\nMy son bein' born and my granny dying on the same day\nMy grandma didn't live anywhere near that hospital\nI learned a lot this day\nI learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out\nFor me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny\nAnd gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son, little Royce\nIt showed me that God is real, God is real\nAnd you know what they say: God giveth, God taketh away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe8f1046936cf77234fa0e8a11477d2a.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
