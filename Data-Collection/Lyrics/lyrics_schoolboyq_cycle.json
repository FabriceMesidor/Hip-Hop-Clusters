Blam-blam to him\nParanoia kills, kill or be killed\nLet alone all them thugs, let alone all them drugs\nTreat his kind like a bud, let's see how karma does\nLet's see how much he loves, shoot him up, shoot him up, bam-bam\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis nigga 21, he feel like he the man\nThis nigga 21, his mom said \"be a man\"\nLove to sag his pants, pistol in his hand\nFeel he too advanced, him slipping out his chance\nThink he at his best, he hit the set he making orders\nGot them little niggas busting shots and flipping quarters\nAn ounce, a half, double up, shit what you order\nEven dimes, think with a corrupted mind\nAdapted to them crimes, living with regrets\nIn order to survive, gotta get high\nCautious with time, paranoia hard through his body\nTrying love for a hobby, you know gangsters come with kids\nTeaching them wasn't his\nEBT the corner store, he go fill up the fridge\nApproached by a little nigga, hoodie over his lid, looking down a barrel\nOf a burner tucked, aimed at his wig, let him fire, then he fire\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e5d39814aadb84f19c68cb7ca188a5d.950x946x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ScHoolboy Q"}
