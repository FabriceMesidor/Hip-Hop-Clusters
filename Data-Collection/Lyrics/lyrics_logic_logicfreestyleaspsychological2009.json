Aight?\n\n[Psychological]:\nHip hop fanatic, my lyrics mathematic\nI been chillin' in the attic like Anne Frank\nWriting in my journal in front of the whole rank like a colonel\nWhenever I'm on the track, guarantee that it's nasty\nHit ya with the steel like Cassey from Degrassi\nYeah, I shut ya down like panic switches\nOn the green mile, call it the road to riches\nSpit fire every time my vocal cord twitches\nMy high-caliber grammar blow you right out ya britches\nKnocking motherfuckers out whenever my knuckle itches\nPsychological, but just call me Logic for short, ya mind I contort\nMurder MCs for the sport\nAll I do is get pussy and write - I'm a dork\nFlyer than projectiles then vacate the airport\nMCs nowadays think it's a rap race\nI'm a lyrical back brace - rap I support\nNineteen almost twenty, rappin' to get the money\nThey see the white boy from Maryland and think it's funny\n'Till I slaughter 'em, lyrically manifested, best to get rid of all 'em\nSpeakin' in the third, he the illest, why they callin' him\nUnderdog 'till he's top dog, they wanna ball with him\nUsed to be a nobody, now all the labels callin' him\nWhy? 'Cause of what the people saw in him\nSpit puzzle pieces so guess I'm jig-sawing 'em\nHalf-white, half-black, that's where I get it, Jack\nI kill the beat, then resurrect it back\nJust to kill it again, double jeopardy, scot-free\nSo, if you feel it, fuck with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
