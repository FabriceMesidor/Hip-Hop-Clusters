Yeah\nI stayed up all night for you\nGirl, girl, what about me? Yeah\nI shut down my life for you\nNow you run around with him, and him, and him\nHow you do that?\nHow you act like I never held you every night?\nAnd now you never call back, please\nGirl, girl, what about me?\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nOh, tell me, do you ever think about it?\nThose lonely nights when you 'bout lost it (Oh)\nThe only time that you would call\nWas just to tell me it's my fault (Oh)\nI let you cry, I let you worry\nI let you yell, I let you hurt me (Oh)\nI gave you everything you needed\nNow you gone, gone, gone\nTell me, how you do that to me? Yeah\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nGirl, what about me? Yeah\nI stayed up all night for you (Yeah)\nGirl, girl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?)\nI shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)\nNow you run around with him, and him, and him\nHow you do that?

Me?\n\n[Verse 2: Post Malone]\nI ain't never been no one to let it go (Let it go)\nNever thought I'd see you leave me in the cold\nEvery time that you got mad\nYou would leave and come right back\nAlways bringing up the past\nGuess you couldn't handle that\nWhere you at when you're not with me?\nYou ignoring my calls\nLook how quick you forgot 'bout me\nI'm waiting\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Post Malone]\nGirl, what about me? Yeah (Girl, what about me?) (Oh)\nI stayed up all night for you (I stayed up all night) (Oh)\nGirl, girl, what about me? (What about me, girl? Yeah, what about me, girl?)\nI shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)\nNow you run around with him, and him, and him\nHow you do that? (How, girl?)\nHow you act like I never held you every night?\nAnd now you never call back, please (Please)\nGirl, girl, what about me? Me?
