Du Bois\nWere no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided\nLittle black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer\nExtra extra on the news stands\nBlack woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan\nMalcolm Little dies as a old man\nMartin Luther King read the eulogy for him\nFollowed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran\nPresident Bush sends condolences from Iran\nWhere FOX News reports live\nThat Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]\nMartin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's\nSo repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it\nWho's ahead of it bun b would be the president\nCause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did\nNot so competitive nobody would be your nemesis\nAin't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did\nA muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist\nListen to method man talking tell em what the method is\nCan do it effordless he would be who your professor is\nMr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites\nJust a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it\nSaving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate\nAnd what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips\nWayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss\nTo make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness\nThey would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages\nLil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did\nNicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it\nNo fighting with a record label to get levarage\nGucci mane would be the c.e.o and talk with eliquence\nJust like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick\nKoopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative\nReality shows stars always show intelligence\nAnd nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich\n\nI know this this type of dream seems like a stretch\nBut everyone of us would be the best\nWith plenty of money\nYea everyone of us would see the change\nAnd we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress\nCause really none of us would be depressed\nWe would do what we wanted\nYa couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshhhh\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Lupe Fiasco:]\nUh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to\nAsk why can't it be?\nNow we can do nothing bout the past\nBut we can do something about the future that we have\nWe can make fast or we can make it last\nEvery woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'\nWhen those color lines come we can't see between\nWe just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
