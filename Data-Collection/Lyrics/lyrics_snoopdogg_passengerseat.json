And now we on tizilt\nInterior, mizilk - exterior, sizilk\nOkay, okay, alright - say it like all day\nIn the tre with the dawgs, that's the player life\nHow you feel now?\nI know - you probably want the wheel now\nBut I can't and I ain't, so just roll up some more of that dank\nAnd pour some more of that drank\nAnd hand me that CD so I can let the shit knock\nLive in the drop\nYou can hear it when we comin', we speedin' up the block\nWhile we're beatin' up the block, it's 'bout to go down\nSlip-sliding, rip-riding with my broham, haha\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/46b2706e09558ef97fa25e88b3d002ec.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
