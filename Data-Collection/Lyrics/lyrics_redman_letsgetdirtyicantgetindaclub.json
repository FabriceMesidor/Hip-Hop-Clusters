Who those motherfuckers coming in here?\nNo, it can't be! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\n[Verse 1:Redman]\nYo.. yo, gimme some room I'm throwing elbows\nTimberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?\nIf I gotta pay to get in the club\nI'mma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten\nI ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P\nI snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P\nMy dress code is all black when I'm making the moves\nSimilar to the new Playstation 2\nI can't help it if the club only packing a G\nAnd the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3\nAnd you balling ass niggas, whose dressed to kill\nFor the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (man!)\nI gotta get in, I drove here\nWith a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere\nMy niggas hit the cells if the line is thick\nSo I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch\n\n[DJ Kool]\nYo Red, wassup man?\nAye they ain't trying to let you in the club!\nYo, DJ Kool to the rescue!\nWe gon' break this joint down!\nAyo.. a-huh, a-huh, ahh!\n\n[Hook: DJ Kool + Redman]\nIf you pumping this one in your truck (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (l-let's get dirty)\nIf you really don't give a WHAT? (l-let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (l-let's get dirty)\nEverybody get your hands up (l-let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (l-let's get dirty)\nIf you ain't come to party SHUT UP! (l-let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty\n\n[Verse 2:Redman]\nYo, security patting my legs and waist\nBut if I vacate the place, it'll be {*gunfire, \"stay down!\"*}\nAll my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three\nWe gonna bum rush the tunnel, with a pound of weed\nCut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here\nBlazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here\nDon't sleep, stay wide awoke\nYou dialed doc, not dial-a-joke\nCrawl or you'll die in smoke\nI keep it heated when the hawk is out\nSeated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out\nI'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool\nLike a three o'clock bully, waiting after school\n(Punks!) I've been in this line for hours\nI even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers\nNow all I wanna do is get in where I fit in\nShake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in\nJUMP, MOVE, CRASH, SMOKE, DRINK\nShake that ass stank, the fuck you think?\nPoppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring\nSince +Def+ is the label I belong in a morgue!\nI'm walking half-dead, acting senile\nWith bigger niggas from jail than the one on \"Green Mile\"\nI'll huff and puff, blow the club down\nI'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown\n\n[DJ Kool]\nYeah that's right! We up in this joint now\nAyo we getting ready to take over\nFreddie, you grab the mic, I'mma grab the turntables\nWe gon' rock this joint baby! - a-huh, a-huh, ahh!\n\n[Hook: DJ Kool + Redman]\nIf you got up in the club free (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nAnd you drunk up in the V.I.P. (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nIf you swinging from them club lights (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nAnd you like to start them club fights (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty\n\nEverybody wave your hands now (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nEverybody jump up and down (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nEverybody come to wild out (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nIf you a big dog no doubt (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty\n\nEverybody wave your hands now (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nEverybody jump up and down (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nEverybody keep it going now (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty (let's get dirty)\nJust a little bit louder now (let's get dirty)\nSay let's get dirty.. c'mon, c'mon!\n\n(let's get dirty)\nA-huh, a-huh, ahh-huh!
