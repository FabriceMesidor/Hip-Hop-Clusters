I know you groan\nWhen I'm in you, I feel home\nWe in the house of love, no lie\nAppreciate you more as time goes by\nWhen it's truly true, it don't die\nI see you in L.A., I see you in N.Y\nI see you in the A, I see you in the Chi\nI hear you when JAY still make the song cry\nTruthfully, I wanna rhyme like common sense\nYou the one that gave me that confidence\nYou the one that told me 'bout consciousness\nAnd said see beyond my metropolis\nYou put the booga-booga loop, pop lockin' this\nWe too far, ain't no stoppin' this (We're too far, now)\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nHere, here, here, here, here, here we go\nThey say that, that love makes you grow\nYou've been sen-sen-sensational\nInstrume-e-intational\nIn my life, you've been vocal\nBut at times, I felt like I didn't know you\nNow I know you had to grow too\nAnd experience life so you can know you\nWe all change, for what it's worth\nYou an angel and still down to earth\nIn many ways you like my religion\nWhen no one else did, to me you listen\nGangstas, gods, you hugged and kiss 'em\nNo matter, you stayed in my system\nYour eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'\nAnd gettin' people out of prison\nThrough the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle\nThat's why we all love you\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you, so just be who you are\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nYou gave me a voice in the world\nIt's been hard to choose another girl\nThey trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing\nBut you gave us a chance to dream\nIn young thugs, you see a future\nYou recognize little uzi ain't here to shoot ya\nAt 21, you knew I was savage\nBut you said, \"Common, you will never be average\"\nIt's a cold world, we need JAY\nIf you could dot com, you could dot K\nYou rock two chains, keep your mind free\nYou see a Malcolm X in a YG\nYou told me I'm the mane like Gucci\nWith a chance to rap and make movies\nYou gave mills to the meek, to inherit the Earth\nBefore me too, you said, \"Ladies first\"\nThings get rocky, you there ASAP\nRocky or Ferg, you there to swerve\nI want you to get the love you deserve\nMy will made it on a mic' with words\nWith no name, I was a hard MC\nLove and hip-hop, on some Cardi B\nNow you a part of me, creatin' Tyler style\nA future ain't odd to see\nFree spirit, with young will like Jaden\nWhen I see you, you never agin'\nMade in America, for the world to see\nYou everybody's but you my girl to me\nI'm forever yours, to the tic-toc\nI'm still talking 'bout you, hip-hop\n\n[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you so just be who you are\nWho knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?\nI, I love you so just be who you are\n\n[Outro: Common & Daniel Caesar]\nUh-uh, uh-uh\nYeah, yeah, we keep, uh\nWe keep, yeah, uh-uh, we keep\nYeah, keep, uh, we-we keep, uh\nWe, uh, ke-ke-keep, uh\nWe, ke-ke-keep, uh\nWe, we ke-ke-keep\nI-I ke-ke-keep it on\nKe-ke-ke-keep it on\nYo, let's, let's, let's go up\nYeah, we-we go up, yeah\nLet's, let's, let's go up, woah\nWe-we-we-we go up, uh\nLet's, let's, let's go up, uh\nWe-we-we-we go up, yeah\nLet's, let's, let's go up, uh\nWe-we-we-we go up, uh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d10b0a3cf2b8f6b40b9d03c01802a905.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Common"}
