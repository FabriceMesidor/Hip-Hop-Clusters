Gave that bitch an encore\nFucked me like a freshman, but\nThat ass just so sophomore\nSaid she got that Glock in line\nYeah, what's your GPA\nI'm in my Chevy bangin like I'm out of East LA\nThem bricks be jumping fast\nCall me a Chick-Fil-A\nYour girl, I cut her ass just like I did today\nIf you dream it, live it\nWe young niggas living\nYSL duffle, already know what's in it\nI see No Limits: make em say uhh!\nI see no niggas with this 100 round drum\nPullin out the club, you know I handle mine\nTakin all these hatin niggas' bitches every time\nHad to pop the trunk, pull out the chopper like it's magic\n50 grand on my lap, poof! Like it's magic\n\n[Hook:]\nFishtailin' out the parkin' lot, leavin' Magic\n2 bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic\nThe way I make the work disappear, call it magic\nSippin on the purple, any other drink magic\nVoila! Magic\n\nI'm awake ? cause I forgot to do my taxes\nCalled my accountant, he gonna make you do magic\n? driver tell him drop me at the airport\nThe way y'all smoke the blunts ?\n50,000 dollars on a suit, scarf and tie\nKE and young Future bringing down the fire", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3dce21029cdd8aab73eb473e015807d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
