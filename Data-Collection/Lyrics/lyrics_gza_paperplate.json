I give it to 'em, burnt and crispy\nRhymes too short to box with God, so stretch it\nEspecially these over-rated raps, step to fetch it\nI told you if I rain, there'll be an eternal drizzle\nWoodwork strips bein' chipped from sharp chizzles\nOne verse shatter your spine and crush your spirit\nIf you was a pimp, put tricks on the stroll\nAnd if those were soldiers, give 'em bigger guns to hold\nWho shot ya? You don't have enough on your roster\nYou move like a fed, but you talk like a mobster\nThat yayo you slingin', please abort it\nToo many cuts on it, cokeheads, they won't snort it\nI spray the Flea Unit with pesticides, and you can get\nYour best ghost writers, get 'em all to testify\nHave you ever been stung by a thousand hornets?\nFive hundred Killa Beez, buzzin' and really on it\nWhipped with Cuban Linx, and cut with Liquid Swords\nChoked by Ironmen 'til we crush your vocal chords\nYou ain't nothin' but a pig in the blanket\nHog head, the deadliest food at the banquet\nAll this rap crap, that's trapped in your colon\nOnly means, get rid of the wack shit you holdin'\nSweet tooth dudes stay out the candy shop\nYou ain't gotta handcuff 'em to see the panties drop\nA few cats is lookin' for a rat with cheese\nGot somethin' to pitch, they all swing a bat with ease\nGet your ankles broke, while doin' your two-step\nLeave a thank you note, for the crutches the Wu left\nProActive rap, you know they put drug in the cream\nYou hallucinate and see Kanye in your dream\nAnd yo, I don't smoke dust, I dust off Smokey and the Bandits\nWith the brush stroke off the canvas\nI walk on your gators and lizards, raise the lynx\nThat was killed for your minks, you be rockin' in blizzards\nWanna be cop, 'til you walk to D-Block\nAnd get entranced for us, spread your wings like peacocks\nI was an MC when you was in Nutville\nOn a world tour, you was gettin' your guts filled\nTen years MC'ing, but I flow like I'm twenty-one\nStraight from Medina, with the mass of many suns\nThe supernova, give off gamma ray bursts\nAnd I'll finish this, only 'cause I let off first, what's up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aec3826e892d3ad57deb62e63fed42c5.940x940x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
