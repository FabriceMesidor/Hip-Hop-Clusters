(Hoo, ayy, ayy)\nFound my home (Hoo, ooh, hoo, oh)\nShe make me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine...\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nReally think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it\n\n[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]\nThere's love at my front door, short notice\nShe not like the sane girls, I noticed\nThink I met my soulmate, yeah, I know it\nWhen it gets dark outside, in you I confide\nYou help me face my demons, I won't hide, hide\nGirls like you are hard to find\nI hope you don't mind, if I give you the time of your life, life, life\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nReally think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it\n\n[Verse 2: Seezyn]\nLife is not the same with your pictures in my frame\nNow that you're here, I want nothing to change\nYou pick me up when I'm down, I need you around\nYou seen me through my darkest times\nGirl, is there something that you try to find?\nYou brought meaning to my life\nAll because of you, I do right\nBecause of you, I have a purpose\nFight for the world because you're worth it\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nReally think I found my home, shorty made me feel at home\nShe made me leave the thrills at home and I'm fine with it\nShe really made me lose control, I'ma let my love unfold\nWe're just two lost souls, but we're fine with it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f8df6f94846dc4a8f2e1b94d7abd1cb5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
