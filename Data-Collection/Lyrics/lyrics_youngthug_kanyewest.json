with no swimwear gear\nYou keep me 'ware lookin' like a peacock\nEverytime we press she be rooster\nFeelin' like the big block time shift\nNumber one Haitian, she in love with the voodoo sex\nFlippin' on the mat yo\nLike olympians in Rio, oh\nBlast off like the rocket man, piano\nScream so loud, dolphins hear the signal\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]\nBet it all, bet it all\nShe pulled up in a Benz
