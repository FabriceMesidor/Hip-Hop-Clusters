bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\nLet's get ready to rumble!\n\n[Intro]\nNow, you know how we do it, like a G\nWhat really go on in the mind of a nigga\nThat get down for theirs\nConstantly, money over bitches\nNot bitches over money\nStay on your grind, nigga\nMy ambitions as a ridah\nMy ambitions as a ridah\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars\nThis life as a rap star is nothin' without guard\nWas born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public\nMy attitude was \"fuck it,\" 'cause motherfuckers love it\nTo be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease\nThough life is complicated, only what you make it to be\nUh, and my ambitions as a ridah\nTo catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her\nThen I spit some game in her ear, \"Go to the telly, ho!\"\nEquipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke\nI'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial\nFrom player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual\nFrom hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up\nI got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us\nI'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'\nCompetition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)\nI'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory\nNo guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted\nNow it's on and it's on because I said so\nCan't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row\nNow these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious\nStarted plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us\nBut thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)\nMe, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night\nGot problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me\nThese niggas is jealous\n'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me\nUh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen\nI catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah\n\n[Chorus]\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\n(My ambitions as a ridah)\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\n(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was my only wish to rise\nAbove these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise\nWhen it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9\nI'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life\nThat's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill\nSo open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel\n(That's all you niggas got?)\nSpittin' at adversaries, envious and after me\nI'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed\nMama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts\nI'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)\nFuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice\nWon't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys\nThuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it\nLet them other brothers try, at least you tried for it\nWhen it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave\nFuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah\n\n[Chorus]\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\n(My ambitions as a ridah)\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me\nPay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me\nI been hesitant to reappear, been away for years\nNow I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears\nQuestion my methods to switch up speeds\nSure as some bitches bleed\nNiggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed\nBlast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers\n(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)\nSo now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace\nThey cowards, that's why they tried to set me up\nHad bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up\nBut I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated\nAt the time I contemplate the way that God made it\nLace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary\nFor money I'll have these motherfuckers buried\nI been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it\nKnowin' when I get out they gon' feel it\nWitness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside\nThe cry from all your people when they find ya\nJust remind ya, my history'll prove authentic\nRevenge on them niggas that played me\nAnd all the cowards that was down with it\nNow it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'\nCatch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah\n\n[Chorus]\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\n(My ambitions as a ridah)\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me", "image":
