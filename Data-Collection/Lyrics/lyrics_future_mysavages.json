That what you really expect?\nYou thinking I'm sitting up depressed?\nI'm somewhere countin' up me a check\nI hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret\nDrag the mink on the floor\nThe Cuban links on my ho\nTen whips in a row, who would think we were poor?\nWho would think we was poor?\nThere's money laying on the floor\nGot some hoes laying on some hoes\nGot a shawty with me, she a pro\nNo she'll never meet another nigga not another nigga like me\nEven if he got a billion dollars he can't make her cum like me\nWho compliment you like me? It better be about an image\nTell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented\nBecause the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide\nI told em I'm through with the pies\nTold 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write\nMy savages, my savages, my savages\nWe gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin\nFree all my niggas incarcerated, you heard?\nLoyal for life, you heard?\nFree band gang!
