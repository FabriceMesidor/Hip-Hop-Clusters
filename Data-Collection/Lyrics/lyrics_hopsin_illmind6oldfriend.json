Who knows?\nThey convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do\nSayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible\nSo you started skippin' school\nHangin' with these wicked dudes\nUnaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool\nAnd it\u2019s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?\nIn they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house\nBack when you met them I had doubts\nThey put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out\nThey fuckin' got you, I can\u2019t lie, but now your brain's fried\nAnd you don\u2019t even act like you\u2019re the same guy\nYour momma told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain\u2019t listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\n\n[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Verse 3]\nI ain\u2019t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore\nI reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64\nAnd that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards\nAnd we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor\nShit changed and it happened quick, but I can\u2019t forget\nThat you was the first homie I started rappin' with\nYou could\u2019ve had half of this back when I had established it\nBut now I have to sit and feel bad\nLook at what your actions did!\nMan, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical\nSeein' you now is just unbearable, it\u2019s terrible\nYou should've made your choices wisely\nFuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?\nIt\u2019s a struggle to get your ass to listen\nReally hurt me and the rest of your family\nWith all your bad decisions\nWe always told you that drugs are bad\nBut you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass\nNow you understand\n\n[Hook]\nNow you always look like you don\u2019t know me\nAnd I\u2019m mad at the world\n'Cause the meth took away my homie\n(Give me back my homie, please come home!)\nI just wanna chill on the neighborhood block\nLike we used to (Where\u2019d you go?)\nI never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future\nBut I was wrong\n\n[Outro]\nExcuse me, do you need a ride?\nLooks like you\u2019re goin' downtown\nYes, hop in my ride!\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth\nI\u2019m your best friend (Chris Dolmeth)\nI\u2019m all you need (Chris Dolmeth)\nIf you wanna succeed, hop in my ride\nWell, hi, I\u2019m Chris Dolmeth", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/26a527cb9c0acdb27b905b786c36188b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
