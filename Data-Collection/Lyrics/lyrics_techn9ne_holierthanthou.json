I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness\nKnow what I'm sayin'?\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nA wise man told me evil was lurkin' and if you found it\nTry your best to not put yourself around it\n'Cause when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but\nThen it\u2019s the sin you begin it, then wish that you stayed grounded\nI went all over the world and I done been through it\nAt the beginning, I knew I wouldn't give in to it\nBut temptation, oh what the sensation\nWomen I am embracin', so many of them waitin'\nContemplatin' how to get fornication\nAt yo door when it's late with the motivation of Satan\nSo they say, but things go they way\nAnd it's more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today\nBut lust it sets in, and crush your chest in\nFor dust you're destined, if drugs are let in\nEnough to nest in, prolly make you punch your best friend\nAnd next kin 'cause you let S-E-X win\nYou mean to tell me you can fight this land\nWith brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?\nYo, I wanna believe that, itching to see that\nIf a positive person can shake the negative feedback\nThat this life has to offer when it's faster\nWhat a disaster if you didn't obey the master\n'Cause that's mutiny, it would be new to me\nIf you was on tour with Tecca N9na and still you could be\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) I know you still my\n(Child) So I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) So I say it for you\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nHow can I move the crowd without losin' out on my faith?\nLucifer out of the way (way)\nOr maybe he don't even exist\nI ain't gotta trip off gettin' hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)\nSee that's how he tricks 'em\nGet 'em sippin' then a big ol' mickey he slips them (I wonder why)\nMusic soothes the savage soul\nPeople can lose it when we lack control\nReally get used to livin' fast and so\nWe smashin' women then they bypass they soul\nThey believin' everything we breathin'\nHalf of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen\nAnd how we get that bad half out?\nWe pray the Lord'll cast that out\nHope he got blessings left and pass that out\nWhen we travellin' and pass that route\nKeep us under your graces in places where we have that doubt\nWhere I stand, he's pointin' at me, but it's with my hand\nI need you, you holier than I am, I am\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) I know you still my\n(Child) So I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) So I say it for you\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nThis verse was intended for a gospel rapper\nThat we all admire and he goes by the name of Da' T.R.U.T.H\nAll we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction\nAnd maybe if he came we could change and regroup\nSo we laid it down and sent it hopin' he would rap wit' us, track splittas\nWaited, and none of his people got back wit' us\nWe kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed\nWe was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash\nBut the lady who represent him would never send him a message from a secular messenger\nNever be no nepotism, we s'posed to be brothers, on the road to teach others\nBut the flow would be covered, better mess with the Tech they know that we smother\nAnybody that diss us, retired of they weak flow\n'Cause this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro\nIf you didn't like it then I admire the ego\nAnd if they never told you, then you better fire ya people\n'Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em\nBut Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims\nBut they always helpin' in the hood, but y'all closed me out\nY'all didn't even really wanna know what we 'bout\nAnd we bombay, T.R.U.T.H ain\u2019t on this, so the Don' spray\nAnd I had to spit on it 'cause I couldn't afford Kanye\nI needed help, your people showed me the wall\nBelow me is y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!\n\n[Interlude: Tech N9ne]\nMuch love to the gospel MC J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation\nEven though most if his peers told him not to 'cause we secular MCs\nThanks for giving me Da' T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro. God bless you, for being so\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & (Strange Lane Choir)]\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) I know you'll be strong, but you've been gone a\n(While) While I know you still my\n(Child) Child, so I'm pullin' for you\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the\n(Clouds) Clouds, you're holier than\n(Thou) Thou, so I say it for you\n(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you\n(Know me, know me) Would you know me?\n(While) WHILE, WHILE\n(Child) You my child now\n(Don\u2019t you owe me) Your soul and if you know it won't you\n(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look up above the\n(Clouds) You're holier than\n(Thou) Oooooooh... yeeeeaaaah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ce6124bde0d76994fd0d3a8ddb1d4e97.1000x994x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
