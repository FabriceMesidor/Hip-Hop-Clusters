get rushed\nGet stuck fucking with us\n'Cause....\nWe don't give a fuck\n\n[Verse 1: Kon Artis]\nOh, we sound like Em clones, huh?\nWhere the fuck you think he started at holmes, huh?\nSkip the small talk, talking is a risk you take\nKick yo' face 'till yo' head go through this window and break\nBreak to the 1-9, Denaun cause the gun-line\nAnd collect bank from every weed spot like I'm one time\nI'm ain't the remorseful type, I'll drink and still drive prone to hit anything at any given night\nFuck leaving my roots, I'm still in cahoots with nincompoops who shoot out like troops in Beirut\nPull up in a red hearse with Fred Durst dressed like a nurse\nWith a coach purse screaming he's [?]\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nOn my Harley Davidson, I ride down Main Street\nI speed with my dad's name on my ass cheek\nGimme your ones and get robbed with a broken gun\nGot you doing more dances than Puffy's son\nAll you groupies that wanna get took\nYou gotta be 12 years old with a coloring book\nAnd anyone else who wanna get fucked, 'cause\n(Yeah bitch, oh shit!)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nWhether you rap or you don't rap\nDuck 'fore you get rushed\nGet stuck fucking with us\n'Cause....\nWe don't give a fuck\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nWe interrupt your little world of perfectness\nTo bring you the shit to murder conservatives with\nTo curse and diss, with verses so merciless\nThese words can just fuck up your high worse than this\n{Police Sirens}\nI've killed for less, and dumped bodies in the motherfuckin' wilderness\nI'm a wildebeest, and I've concealed a piece even after I was busted by Warren Police\nYou think just because I got caught by these cops once\nI'm not gonna carry shotguns to blow your wigs back like hamburgers without any top buns\nSo many damn murders I can't even count one\nTwo black guns, I don't know maybe they're Magnums\nI don't know what the fuck they're called, I just grab them\n12-gauge dumps in a drug-fueled rage, fuck age, still goin' through my \"fuck-you\" stage\nI'm a 27-year-old eleven-year-old, I'mma never grow up, bitch, I ain't gon' ever get old\nI'll be sitting here with a cane and a beard\nStill insane and as weird as the day I came in here, brain in my rear, yeah\nSo until I'm wrinkled as Robert Van Winkle, I'mma drop a damn single every goddamn week, people\nIt's D12, June 19th, so do like me, and go buy three, with no ID\nKids\n\n[Verse 4: Proof]\nNow why you wanna play a game with me, dangerously\nThe outcome's hot, once split your brain in three\nProof with crooked raps, always ask them \"What the fuck you lookin' at\"?\nAnd invite the hook to scrap\nI gave my life to God, nigga, then I took it back\nTook it black, this fuckin' gat will leave your cookie cracked\nDetroit's derelict arrogant terrorist, straight on you aerospit\nSpit at various people, to leave you [?] bloody 'till you're buried with\nEvery hit was serious, niggas wanna know how murderous the Dirty Harry is\nWhen I'm on your front porch with guns about to bust\n'Cause\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nWhether you rap or you don't rap\nDuck 'fore you get rushed\nGet stuck fucking with us\n'Cause....\nWe don't give a fuck\n\n[Verse 5: Swift]\nWhen they run into Swift they change directions\nMy shit so tight when hoes hear it they catch a yeast infection\nYou need protection, you gon' fear it\nI snatch away yo' DNA from existence, with no spirit\nGive up the carats or see the nine\nFuckin' with mine is like Farakhan chewin' up swine, on Christmas\nWith a white trailer bitch on his arm, chillin' in Europe, havin dinner with a Uncle Tom\nI attack killin', fuckin' hoes like Matt Dillon\nStackin' obituaries higher than Michael Jackson's ceiling\nI leaves nobody livin', I got Satan shiverin'\nHate what I'm deliverin', you know the best then send 'em in, crack you with a fifth of gin\nYou got your men, but they all wearin' skirts like them niggas from Scotland, you hoes are not grim\nDon't make me stop in with a mag, and blow yo feet up out yo Top Tens\n\n[Verse 6: Kuniva]\nI'm the one they call in to torture ya\nSmackin' your bitch and forcin' her in the back seat of an old Corcia\nKuniva's the silent type, but under the silence is a violent life, usually followed by sirens and lights\nGet your throat cut by this tyrant's knife, from high as a kite\nAnd my get-a-way driver's drivin' right\nFuckin' with Hans will get you flipped like a baton, the deadliest bombs\nWrap around niggas like Camabons, you know I ain't nothin' to play with\nThinkin' you real like The Matrix, fuckin' with niggas drippin' off self-hatred\nI'm on some live shit, rappers be on some \"Ready To Die\" shit\n'Till I put a ice pick, right through they eyelids, fuck heaters, I'll knock you out instead of shootin'\nI hit hard, break yo' fuckin' jaw like Resolution\nGive up the cash and coat, or get your little brother's classroom smoked\nAnd the substitue gagged and choked\nNigga\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nWhether you rap or you don't rap\nDuck 'fore you get rushed\nGet stuck fucking with us\n'Cause....\nWe don't give a fuck\n\n[Outro]\nD12, June 19th\nDo 'shrooms like me\nGet ready for it.\nTrouble soon, baby\nYou know it\nTell your mama and your sister too\n'Cause we fuckin' 'em", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8ff2bbc4db6fb4f57c562ac93cec9dc7.618x347x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
