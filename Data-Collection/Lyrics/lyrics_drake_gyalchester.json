Facts?\nContract max, I gotta bring that shit back\n\n[Chorus]\nHerm\u00e8s link, ice-blue mink\nTat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is\nThey want me gone, out of the picture\nBury me now and I only get bigger\nThat's word to my, word to my\u2014\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so hot, yeah, I\u2019m so right now\nWho's not gang, bitch? Let me find out\nKeep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone\nFeds in the city hate to see us on a high note\nI switch flow like I switch time zone\nCan't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone\nI gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo\nGotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home\nYeah, met her once and I got through\nI'm never washed, but I'm not new\nI know I said top five, but I'm top two\nAnd I'm not two and I got one\nThought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah\n\n[Chorus]\nHerm\u00e8s link, ice-blue mink\nTat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is\nThey want me gone, wait for the kicker\nBury me now and I only get bigger\nThat's word to my nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4672f8523e0fbf7f7848185256e946f4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
