I'm rude, rugged and love to intrude ruckus\nToo stubborn, I got the motherfuckin' juice chuggin'\nYou think you runnin' shit but you really my cute puppet\nJust danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace\nDon't care if you poppin', bitch, you basic as fuck to me\nI've been labeled a fuckin' beast, it's a fatal corrupt disease\nDon't be callin' tryna sit for a bagel and cup of tea, my nigga\n\n[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you off proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nSavage!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the dirty scoundrel, livin' life on the down-low\nI've been to Hell, I sat with the man of the household\nMy heart froze, but you don't wanna know how cold\nI feel like the one, but I ain't what you should count on\nBuckle up, nigga! Have a blast, I'm an avalanche\nMashin' fans down on your master plan with a planned attack\nIt's like a massive pack of elephants, charge you with cataracts\nSo call an ambulance, I'm the straw that just broke the camel's back\nYou don't want problems, I'm serious, I am too sick (yeah, yeah)\nI promise I ain't delirious, I can prove it (yeah, yeah)\nThink twice, nigga, I'm eerie as Tyson's toothpick\nUndercover Prodigy, visualize the movement, nigga\nThis is a brand new side of me that's emergin'\nEvil and purgin', I am more deceivin' in person\nScreamin' and cursin', fuck the world with penis insertions\nI'ma feel this way until the day I'm leavin' this Earth, man\n\n[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you off proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nSavage!\n\n[Chorus]\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma? A sangoma?\nI can show you the way if you want to know\nWitch doctor, witch doctor\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma? A sangoma?\nSomebody better call the witch doctor (witch doctor)\nWi-wi-wi-witch doctor!\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen, I ain't gon' pretend to be the best\nI don't give a fuck about ever bein' politically correct\nLook at the fans that all my misery has blessed\nAs long as I'm breathin' I ain't gon' give emcees a rest\nMusic can make a struggle seem cool \u2014 it's not\nDo you know what the fuck I've been through? A lot\nThere is an evil me that speaks to me every evening\nI tried to get rid of him but he rules my thoughts\n\n[Hook]\nOoh, you don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nFuck around and break you off proper\nYou gon' need to see the fuckin' witch doctor (sangoma)\nNigga, peep game, no shame, I won't ever change\nYou don't want the backlash\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\nSlow down, nigga!\nWhy you actin' like a badass? Slow down, nigga!\n\n[Chorus]\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma? A sangoma?\nI can show you the way if you want to know\nWitch doctor, witch doctor\nSoek jy \u2018n sangoma? Soek jy \u2018n sangoma?
