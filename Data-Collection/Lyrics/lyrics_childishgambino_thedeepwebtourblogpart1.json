This page is a tool for further exploration\n[Page 1]\n[Page 2]\n[Pages 3-7]\n[Page 8]\n[Page 9]\n\nAll i do is see bars, u should\nHandcuff 'em\nScreamin \"jesus\" while i'm in\nHer, that's the second cumin...\n\n\n...i'm going to hell\n[Page 10]\n[Page 11]\n[Page 12]\n[Page 13]\n\nThe DEEP WEB TOUR started\n\nOakland was hard because we didn\u2019t play.  which was weird.  people were mad.  but then someone got married, rather engaged, outside so people got happy again and forgave.  it was the computer\u2019s fault tho\n\nWe talked about getting a tour pet.  stefan is unofficially the tour pet\n\nIt\u2019s very cool to see people use the DEEP WEB app. people draw dicks and swastikas\n\nIn santa barbara, we got to play outside.  i had a burrito for breakfast that morning. it was fun cause fam and i wore backpacks to blend in to the crowd on campus to get there.  someone said \u201cthat nigga think he childish gambino\u201d. i did think that\n\nWhen we get to stop at a hotel,  we call down and tell the concierge to check on our children at 9pm because \u201cwe\u2019re going out to a cocktail party and they should be in bed by that time\u201d. and when they go up there, steve and swank (two grown men who are probably smoking blunts and listening to young scooter) are up there. the reaction is always enjoyable.  we\u2019re trying to find an older white couple to come downstairs and tell the concierge for us, to really sell it. but we haven\u2019t found someone willing to yet\n\n\n\n\u201cyou\u2019re gonna miss every moment of this\u2026of everything.\u201d\n\nSometimes i feel like i\u2019m already gone/ahead and i\u2019m just vividly remembering everything that\u2019s happening in the moment. fur real. sometimes everything feels too familiar to be just happening for the first time. the shows feel like that sometimes. you can\u2019t understand something totally and enjoy it at the same time, i think. but it\u2019s fun to not know all of it.  everybody wants some magic.  something they can\u2019t quite figure out\n\nSomeone put girl scout cookies in the freezer. hot damn\n\n\n\nUNOFFICIAL BUS PLAYLIST\n\nNothin important than money \u2013 young scooter\nFall in love \u2013 phantagram\nThis song i\u2019ve been working on when im given a moment \u2013 me\nWhat you won\u2019t do for love \u2013 bobby caldwell\n(the second half of) lost queen \u2013 pharrell\nStranger in moscow \u2013 tame impala\nThis song she hasn\u2019t released yet, but it\u2019s really good - jean deaux\n[Page 14]\n\nME: are you wearing that?\nRAY: Yes.
