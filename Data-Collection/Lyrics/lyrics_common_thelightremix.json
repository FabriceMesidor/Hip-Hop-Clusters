Erykah Badu)\n\n(Chorus)\n[Erykah Badu]\nThere are times.. when you'll need someone..\nI will be by your side..\nThere is a light, that shines\nSpecial for you, and me..\n\nI never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this\nGotta be somethin for me to write this\nQueen, I ain't seen you in a minute\nWrote this letter, and finally decide to send it\nSigned sealed delivered for us to grow together\nLove has no limit, let's spend it slow forever\nI know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you\nI ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too\nBecause of you, feelings I handle with care\nSome niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare\nYou know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts\nIf relationship is effort I will match your work\nI wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most\nThey say the end is near, it's important that we close..\n.. to the most, high\nRegardless of what happen on him let's rely\n\n(Chorus)\nYo, yo, check it\nIt's important, we communicate\nAnd tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch\nI never call you my bitch or even my boo\nThere's so much in a name and so much more in you\nFew understand the union of woman and man\nAnd sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land\nBut that's fly by night for you and the sky I write\nFor in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light\nIf heaven had a height, you would be that tall\nGhetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all\nLet's stick to understandin and we won't fall\nFor better or worse times, I hope to me you call\nSo I pray everyday more than anything\nFriends will stay as we begin to lay\nThis foundation for a family - love ain't simple\nWhy can't it be anything worth having you work at annually\nGranted we known each other for some time\nIt don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine\n\n(Chorus)\nYeah.. yo, yo, check it\nIt's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop\nAnd I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop\nPlus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh\nSuggestin beats I should rhyme to\nAt times when I'm lost I try to find you\nYou know to give me space when it's time to\nMy heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness\nTruthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence\nThe time we committed love it was real good\nHad to be for me to arrive and it still feel good\nI know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal\nIt's how I must treat you\nAs my reflection in light I'ma lead you\nAnd whatever's right, I'ma feed you\nDigga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da\nYo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace\n\n(Chorus)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/334bd07941665eb5b381fb51bced319d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
