No. hustle and survive\nWorkin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes\nAnd if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies\nSwitchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive\nReminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke\nJesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost\nAmen!\n\n[Hook]\nMy Phantom so mean\nLike I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water\nMy Jesus piece clean\nEven my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water\nShe came out them True Religion jeans\nAnd fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water\nHoly water\nHoly water", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd068b5a01b261090f4744693ea09c67.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
