What is that smell?\nGlasses tortoise shell\nYou a waitress, tell you hold the L\n\n[Interlude]\nOver to you B.o.B\nMan I tell ya, it's a great night here in Atlanta\nFor all the people that just got here\nWelcome to Atlanta\nHoes be hoin'\nSchemers be schemin'\nTrappers be trappin'\nThots be thottin'\nNiggas be niggin'\nAnd it's like that\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm armed and present, I'm beyond eclectic, this is Armageddon\nGet your army and your armor ready, get your bomber ready\nI'm a monsta and you headed in the swamp direction\nTrespass find yourself pointed in the pump direction\nI would apologize and issue out a statement\nBut controversy is way too entertainin'\nThe let down of the American dream\nI guess life is not a swell as it seemed\nAll this false hope passed down from generation to generation\nYou thought lil' man man would be amazin'\nAnd get an education\nBut he still live in the basement, sellin' eighths to the neighbors\nThe last slice of weddin' cake in the fridge\nHe got a couple of side kids, fuckin' hoes in your crib\nNiggas bug me, get the D\nBut books are nigga repellent, I tell them read\n\n[Outro]\nThat all we have for tonight\nWe gonna get out of here\nAnd pay these light bills ah, pay these rents ha\nYeah Georgia power don't take EBTs\nSo we can do this shit for free on TV ha\nAnd remember, don't drink and drive\nJust smoke and fly\nWhere's that fucking bar at", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a9a03f89f8f3d7ce8b4db691d6f598db.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
