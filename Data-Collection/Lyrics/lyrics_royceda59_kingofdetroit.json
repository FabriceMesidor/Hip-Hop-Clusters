Then come get it\n\n[Hook]\nYou gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us\nA lot more jewels to floss wit us\nIt's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us\nAnd a lot more niggas to buck wit us\n\n[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nYo, yo, yo.. we must, represent for us\nCause where we from, we eat, sleep and shit Detroit and that's us\nY'all slide by, side by the real niggas\nAin't nothin but stand by to get killed niggas - what!\nTryna make the most of this time, we ain't inside forever\nThis is life, nobody makes it out alive - NEVER\nI'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song\nTo get the platinum plaques back to Detroit, bring it home\n\n[Hook]\nYou gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us\nA lot more jewels to floss wit us\nIt's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us\nAnd a lot more niggas to buck wit us\nYou gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us\nA lot more jewels to floss wit us\nIt's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us\nAnd a lot more niggas to buck wit us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d86b45b993cdf0c53559e740521a4bba.500x494x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
