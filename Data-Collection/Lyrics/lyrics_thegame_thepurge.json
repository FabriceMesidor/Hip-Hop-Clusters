Are we gonna die?\nWe are dying\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nLight a blunt, throw on Nas, collect my thoughts\nBlow the candles out as I contemplate in the dark\nDumpin' ashes on the fuckin' Time magazine\nTryna burn a hole between Israel and Palestine\nAll this world news, all these dead bodies\nAll these kids dying, the talk of illuminati\nAs I'm murderin' ink, I get a call from Irv Gotti\nSay \"Keep spittin' cause when you do it's like a 12-gauge shotty\"\nGot machetes and them cannons loaded up\nGot them Xany's and that lean in my cup\nThese politician's can come up missin', I'm on a mission\nYou hear them gun shots, now mother fuckers listenin'\nFeel that you can take their life cause they ain't got a pot to piss in\nRaise the Christian, kill you for these kids as victims\nFuck the system\nYou give a kid 30 cent and think you sponsor somethin'?\nI feed a village by myself nigga Compton comin'\nPurge\n\n[Hook: Stacy Barthe (Game)]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times I gotta purge\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe're living on a purge\n(Sometimes I wanna)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nWhat if we ran through Beverley Hills, got 70 kills\nRidin' down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills\nAnd pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle\nAnd shot one, Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz\nI got one, beam on the back of his dome\nPalm sweaty on the back of the chrome\nThat's my adrenaline\nSo we purge Sandusky, purge Zimmerman\nPurge every mother fucker rapin' women in\nPurge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans\nMe and my mercenaries, middle of South Sudan\nCarryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands\nLong as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep\nWe purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now\nCrash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down\nTwo hundred and ninety eight innocent lives severed\nFlyin' on Aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven\nAnd so we Purge\n\n[Hook]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nImagine going to the stores without cops harrasing\nImagine Mike Brown walkin', them same cops just passed 'em\nI'm smokin' hash, and let me ash it before I talk in past tense\nI hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges\n2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion\nThinkin' 'bout his casket in this Phantom, swear I almost crashed it\nThat's why I'm headed to Ferguson with this German luger\nCause I'm probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther\nMore like Ice T than Ice Cube, I'm a cop killer\nMurder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'\nOn my knees prayin', wish my nigga Pac was livin'\nBut he fell victim to the Rampart Division, purge\nCops killed Biggie, cops beat up Rodney King\nWe tore up the city nigga, purge\nOr just stand there like J. Cole\nAnd shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed, purge\n\n[Hook]\nWe are dying, we are dying\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\n(Sometimes I wanna purge)\nWe are dying, some times\n(Sometimes I wanna)\nWe are dying\n(purge)\n\n[Outro: Game]\nThis song is dedicated\nTo my engineer Jus' wife\nCarey Jean who passed away June 28th at 1.45 pm\nTo stomach cancer\n2 days before my son Harlem's 11th birthday\nCrazy how he mournin' his wife's death and I'm celebrating my son's life\nI'll never understand death, shit\nSometimes it's a struggle to understand life, shit crazy\nI'll never understand\nCan't stop fightin' to survive though, but what we fightin' for when we eventually all die though, purge\nEventually we all victims of the purge\nUs killers, what's keepin' us alive\nIt's a question nobody got the answer to\nSo PURGE!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3c242f72b054b6d20e2e8fd97f060d73.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
