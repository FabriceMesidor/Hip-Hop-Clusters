You need a teammate\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side\n\n[Bridge: Jack Red]\nAnd now that we made it\nCame in with an angel around us\nPut it all in what we doing next\nOoo you know we can't go without it\nNever go alone it never lasts\nSo we get to make what we want\nHome has come at last\nYeaaa\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side\nPeople, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go\nWe're right by your side", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db1a9643a028d62543e44c90da3a6ad.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
