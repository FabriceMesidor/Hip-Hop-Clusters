Yo, I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity\nHolds that of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level\nIs hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist\nInterceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse\nAnd stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation\nCollaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6e220e2f1f9e33ac4660325cec18147.490x490x1.png"}], "artist": "Bad Meets Evil"}
