Bring in a truckload with a high-low\n\nMy name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips\nScrewdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up\n\nI came in this game with, bad intentions\nAnd I ain't budged, not even an inch since then\n\nLava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp\nI'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass\n\nGot my self esteem back, got my confidence up\nI'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut\n\nShady man, I done told you once homie to easy up\nBut you just won\u2019t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8620329c108ec42caad0f9505a33103.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
