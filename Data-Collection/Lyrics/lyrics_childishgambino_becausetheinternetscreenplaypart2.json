What does that mean?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: What?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Roscoe's wetsuit\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: Oh. I don't know\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Yes you do\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: Wha?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: You know what it means. Tell me\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: I don't know. I saw it online\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: So you just write shit you see?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: Fuck's your problem?\n\nFam walks up. Grabs The Boy\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Ey. Let's just eat\n\nThe Boy and Fam sit\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HAT KID: It means I sat on your mom's face\n\nThe Boy SLAMS his fist on the table. It's loud. Everyone in the diner looks at him. The Boy doesn't look up\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (quiet): Tell me what it is or I'll cut you open and take the answer\n\nSilence\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOTEL - NIGHT\nThe guys roll up to the front of the hotel\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: That kid was scared as fuck! He was like [OPEN MOUTH EMOJI]\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM (to The Boy): You good?\n\nBoy doesn't say anything\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT\nThe guys walk in the lobby. There's an Indian wedding happening. They're probably not called Indian weddings. It's probably just a wedding, but all the people participating happen to be Indian. There's a bunch of guys talking and quietly laughing in the hall. The door to the banquet room is open as they pass. The Boy stops. The bride and groom are slow dancing. The Bride is quite pretty. Green eyes and dark skin. She's got the aura of a business woman. Probably met him at Stanford and was like \"this is reliable\". The groom looks like a caricature of a good ol' fashion white dude\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0STEVE: Good for him\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: Nah. He don't get any interracial points. He's just doing what white guys been doing since forever. Exactly what he wants\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0AJ: Really? Like that?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: Man, I used to get so pissed when girls would watch Boy Meets World and be like \"Ryder Strong's so dope for having a black girlfriend\". Man, fuck that nigga\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0AJ: Come on, man. My dad's white and his parents didn't like my mom. They just started talking again\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK (over the top): Oh you're poor white dad! (then) Nigga, shut up. Take that team light skin shit outside\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I've never seen one of these\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: A first dance?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: A wedding\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Yeah. (then) Marriage is so wack. I mean, I get it. But come on, yo. Forever? (\"Ms. Jackson\") Forever, ever? Forever, ever?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: You think either of them don't wanna do it?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Mane, I bet both of em are like that\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: They look happy as fuck though\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Cause they reached their goal. In a year they'll\nBe like \"oh fuck...goals are dumb.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS: Goals are dumb?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Making your life a goal is dumb. I think. This shit is supposed to be just fun. (then) I took an edible at the diner. It's kickin in. Hard. I'mma go upstairs\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Okay\n\nThey both stand there for a moment\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: I'm gonna need some help\n\nAJ takes Fam by the arm\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM (CONT'D): There we go\n\nThey head to the elevators\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS: I'mma look for some bridesmaids\n\nHe walks off\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0STEVE (yelling to Marcus): Gee-van-chi!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MARCUS (calling back): Nigga, god bless you\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0STEVE (to The Boy): What you doin?\n\nThe Boy stares at the couple\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I'mma stay down here\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: You good?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I'm great\n\nThey Kanye shrug, then walk off to the bar. The Boy walks into the banquet\n\nINT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT\n\nThe lights are low. Most of the people have gotten up to pee or something. The Boy just stares at the couple. Then he decides to start recording. A man comes up to him\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE:Who are you here with?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (not looking up from his phone): The groom. We went to college together\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh. (then) Nice isn't it?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (sincere): Beautiful\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: When the buddies start getting\nMarried, that means you're next\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I don't think so\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's what everyone says. That's what I said thirty years ago\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I don't believe in marriage. (then) Maybe that's not true. But I am against it\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: What do you believe in?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Cool baby mamas\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Ahhhhh. But how many women you know are interested in your concept?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: More than you'd think. I find if you have a job and are actually interested in raising a child, women, who are a little older, tend to be responsive. I just don't think they like being labeled that. (then) Do you get tired of it?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Of marriage?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Of marriage. Of her. Of yourself\n\nHe thinks\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Yes. Sometimes\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Then why?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: I had to man-up. It was time. I\nDon't regret it\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Well I don't have to man-up. I did what I'm supposed to do. I found the things I'm good at. I didn't get anyone pregnant on the way there. And I've had mature relationships that prepared me for what marriage is\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Mature relationships?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Yeah. I keep in touch with all my exes. We're all friends\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: You still call them\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I send em a happy birthday text or DM 'em\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's not a friend. I do that with my boss. And I hate my boss. (to himself) Fuckin Korean kid thinks he know everything\n\nSilence\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE (CONT'D): What do you do?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I troll celebrities, politicians, or anyone with large enough online cache until I get a response. I post those responses and/or convos on my blog. And I charge gossip blogs and advertisers to advertise on my site and sometimes me and my friend put out novelty books of fucked up things we find online while digging up dirt on said celebrities and/ or politicians and sell it to niche book stores or larger stores that fit our aesthetic\n\nThe man just stares, not understanding\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): How old are you?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh\n\nThe older man leaves. A shlubby man in a suit comes to the podium in front. People clap for the end of the dance\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MAN IN SUIT: I've known Safia and Greg since college and I honestly knew this day would happen since we were getting high in my dorm room junior year at GW. (to mom) Sorry Mrs. Healey, Greg smokes weed. You gotta deal!\n\nEveryone laughs\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): But honestly, may you two spend the rest of your lives healthy and happy\n\n\"Awwww\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): And now, the traditional \"march to forever\" to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come\n\nEveryone claps\n\n*******[PLAY SONG \"3005\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nLittle creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say \"HAPPY MARRIAGE!\". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong\n\nAll the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals\n\nAll the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic)\n\nThey're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. Insinuating carnivorous behavior. If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now. They're marching\nOne of the creatures has tears in its eyes. Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile\n\nEveryone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious. Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop. The music stops\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CREATURE 1: We did it!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CREATURE 2: Yay!\n\nEveryone claps. The bride and groom force a smile. The creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. All that's heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor. One stares at The Boy as he (or she) leaves\n\n...that was unacceptable.
