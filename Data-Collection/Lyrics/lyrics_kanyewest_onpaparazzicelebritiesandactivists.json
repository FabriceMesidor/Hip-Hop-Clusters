And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it\u2019s kind of a no-win situation a little bit.\n\n[Kanye West]\nWell except for the fact that I\u2019m going to do something about it. You know, I\u2019m going to make a change. I think it\u2019s my responsibility. My mom, she got arrested for being in the sit-ins at age 6. My grandfather drove the first car at the marches leaving out of Oklahoma. My father was an activist, so I think they just like, messed with the wrong celebrity just now.\n\n[Conan O\u2019Brien]\nRight. Okay so you\u2019re letting them know, leave me alone.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9fa6626ebb7cecda3ba692c1c80f52bf.1000x664x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
