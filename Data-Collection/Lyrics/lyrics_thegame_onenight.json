Right there!\nI had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs\nI'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear\nThe last twelve months been a fucking nightmare\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nThis shit worse than arguing with my bitch\nI done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch\nGet yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish\nI was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit\nNigga you tell me, what you want me to do\nDrop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?\nOh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you\nI put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru\nAnd the reality is, I could die too\nAnd end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot\nAngels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box\nYou wanted my shine so I gave you ice\nThen I gave you a second chance and you played me twice\nCouldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life\nI shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Andrea Martin]\nBlack Wall Street fo' life\nOnly fuck with you on two occasions\nWhen I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high\nI only, fuck with you...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8733b8e495bb8c50e53cd1da0aada2cb.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
