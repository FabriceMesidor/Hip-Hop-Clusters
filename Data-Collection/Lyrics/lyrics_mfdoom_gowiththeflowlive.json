Let mud fly\nWhen I got blues I chew whole crews that's bud dry\nSo I ask why the styes from the cess\nShit be fucking with my eye as I pull it to the chest\nThe super motherfucking villain grip the mic with an iron hand\nThrowing MCs to the fire from out the frying pan\nIt ain't no use in trying, man, son stop crying\nFronting like you death-defying, you need to stop lying\nSpeak your piece only once you're spoken to first\nNow let me hear your verse while I'm choking you\nWith well refined rhymes like a editor\nThrow them to my collections of skulls and spines like Predator\nFuck around, the only niggas who could hear the same sound (Who?) was Jet Jaguar and James Brown\n(yeah yeah, only them two)\nAin't you glad I took the time to write their names down to big 'em up (True, true)\nI'd like to say, \"Hi, it's Sci.Fly the odd Merlin\"\nThat's quick to whip up a script like Rod Serling\nWho eye on bad bitch who used to whip the Sterling\nWho see God toke but never see God hurlin'\nMy man Grimm had his little monkey like Space Ghost\nMe myself I got flavors that out-taste most\nWith numb gums, some rhymers is lactose\nBack to you MF DOOM, you late show host\nS to the U to the P E R-uh\nWho chronicle these times in a 3D horror\nThriller porno co-starrer in a realer drama\nWho break bread with stingy kin-men, indian borrower\nLone gunman who candidly flip fly flows\nSingle-handedly with one eye closed\nIn a fly pose, no shirt Alay\u00e9\nMay see me stack the quarter-mill cash pay\nThat's that n a smash way how he did it\nMotherfucker probably couldn't peep it past a minute\nExquisite scripts, that quick shit, go with flow\nThat's how we do it though", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59f6ee6fc29f200249ae9c797066d9f8.812x812x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
