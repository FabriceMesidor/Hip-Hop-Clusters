So playa I pull the stud's math\nThose in power get golden showers and bloodbaths\nIn shitstorms, I spit thorns and pierce through\nThe nearest crew, who never knew I was fierce, but\nFear is true with the clearest view\nThey grim and hate, and imitate what they hear us doin'\nImmolate, I'll demonstrate how their spear flew\nTo higher ground and came down like a parachute\nFor fucking with me, Royce, Black, and June\nWe'll lay you on your back in black lagoon\n\n[Outro: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nIf this ain't real hip hop\nWhat the fuck is it then?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f26afa0e15f73eb0b5cef561ec304c68.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
