Punk bitch talkin junk bitch\nFuck around and you'll be found in a trunk bitch\nNiggas is off-brand like no frills\nAnd I got mo' skills to show my fo' kills, my fuckin fo' thrills\nGot some cold shit, have you like - \"Oh shit!\" Don't laugh money\nWhen I'm done with this nigga, I'm gettin in yo' shit\nBreak niggas, especially fake niggas over dumb shit\nWith one hit, watch the dum-dum split this bum's shit\n\nChorus\n\n[DMX]\nFuckin see some cats thinkin the worst\nDumb cats, them cats sleep in a hearse\nWhere yo' guns at? Run that, see a nigga thirst\nBeen there, done that, and did it first\nNigga can't tell me shit about this\nAnd I keep somethin that'll hit if I miss\nOne thing a nigga stay with is hot shit\nGot this, what you cats want? Not this\nI constantly gots to remind young niggas\nUh-uhh, don't do that, some niggas\nThink cause I ain't killed a nigga this week\nThat shit is sweet\nFuck around, you'll be dead in the street\nRed with a sheet, over the corpse\nShit is deep, so I shed a tear, over the loss\nIf you creep, then you niggas'll roll with the force\nShoulda paid that money that you owed to the boss\n\nChorus\n\n[DMX]\nUh-huh\nDon't do it dog, it's just not worth it\nPlease heh, for your sake, hehehe\nY'know?
