Feel it? Feel It?\nDon't you know that I'm unfuckwittable?\nDon't you feel it?\nYou know that I'm unfuckwittable?\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]\nOne day I knew no one could help me in Hell\nNot many people are true, fake as the lies they tell\nThe world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek\nAnd now I'm feeling more than cool, oh yeah\nI'm feeling more than cool\nThem Jokers can't hold me\n\n[Hook]\nDon't you feel it? Feel it? Feel It?\nYou know that I'm unfuckwittable?\nDon't you feel it?\nYou know that I'm unfuckwittable?\n\n[Hook]\nDon't you feel it? Feel it?
