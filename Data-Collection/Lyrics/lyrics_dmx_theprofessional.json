POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)\n\nI look through the 11th floor window\nTake one last puff of the indo\nLook through the scope, and let like ten go\nBreak it down, back in the briefcase\nWipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe\nOutside I breathe safe\nNigga never saw it comin, that's how he got it\nNever even thought of runnin, cause a nigga plotted\nSmart niggas get niggas killed for real\nI know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel\nIt's gon' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you\nStop you in your motherfuckin tracks nigga and drop you\nGet rid of all the clothes (uh-huh) dump the gun\nI hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slugged and run\nBut I'm on the job and right now there's more niggas that need to be, left with a head full of lead, restin easily\nAnd that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use\nThe only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI can catch you in the very building that you live in\nWait until you get right at your door then start spittin\nNow they got a ribbon tied to the rail at the top of the steps\nI was there, you ain't DIE at the top of the steps\nI can do that walk behind you shit and follow you home (shhh)\nMake a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (BOOM!\nLast thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light\nI blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight\nI could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (BOOM!)\nThen make em call, tell em all they found was a piece of your clothes and a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm\nWhich they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb\nI could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat\nWith some fuckin chickenwire, soon as you hit the backstreet\nI jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass\nClean up the mess and, get away from the cops\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI could be the UPS delivery boy (uh-huh) or the man\nWorkin at Toys'R'Us handin yo' kid a brand new toy\nI could be the one servin your food wherever you go to eat at\nOr that nigga on the corner that you ask, \"Yo, where the weed at?\"\nI could be the one driving the school bus that yo' kids in\nExcept that, I don't like to involve, women and children\nA nigga got feelings, I just put em aside\nAnd when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride\nI don't get much sleep (uh) my soul's tormented\nI wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it\nI know I'm doin wrong and everyday I beg the Lord\nTo forgive me for fuckin with the, double-edged sword\nShit ain't goin too well, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE\nI know I'm goin to hell, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE\nSometimes I think what will I do, WITH MY LIFE\nKill nigga kill this IS MY LIFE\n\nChorus 2.5X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57efb548310ed90e73d9200fd01a3e59.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
