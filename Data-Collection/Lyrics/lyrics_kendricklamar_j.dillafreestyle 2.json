Usher\nEither way i'm caught up in materialistic\nAnything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it\nGetting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip\nThe home of the stray bullet that murder the innocent\nNo matter the crime rate I still remain content\nMoving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars\nThen it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend\nI holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence\n(Holla) - x4\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Rock]\nI woke up this morning, counting my cash\nGirls calling me now, straight throwing the ass\nI threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch\nLaced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece\nThey used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast\nWith my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets\nFrom my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone\nNigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne\nDog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit\nCall me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse\nI don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders\nTrapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island\nI was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter\nNigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital\nYou got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga\nI spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga\nKnown as a mack, I can influence your bitch\nI'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick\nI'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us\nSee them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing\nBut keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef\nJay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets\nI can't help it, the hood flow through my blood\nThis gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug\nEverybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas\nWrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga\nRaised in the projects, money my object\nThey standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them\nYou'll get shot walking through my section\nNow you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school\nEveryday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing\nShit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens\nMoney over bitches, nigga i'm heartless\nMoney over bitch niggas, rich is my target\n(target) - x4", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0d736130ef89ba0b866b3b01fad325c1.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
