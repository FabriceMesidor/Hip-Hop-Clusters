I know I am good for something\nLord let me know if my suffering will be in vain\nOr how much longer will it rain?\n\nOr how much longer will a stain\nBy the blood has been shed through out my life, remain\nOr how much longer will the pain in the flame\nThe only thing i gave the game is saying your name\n\n\n[hook]\nIf you know god is working in your life\nShout it\nIf you know god then youre gon' be alright\nShout it\nIf you know god and you know what he's like\nShout it\nIf you know god then just jump and shout it\nShout it\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went from \"why bother\" to \"Imma a try harder\"\nKnowing the only way to make it is through my Father\nStay right beside me, during the ride was rough\nAnd for a minute the devil tied me up\n\nMy lifes stopped working, but the clock warns, she was right on time\nAnd I was so happy to see him that it had me crying\nThen enjoyed him, know you got a saviour\nStarting to be changing your behaviour\n\nMake you wanna shout more, make you wanna live more\nYou could do without more make you wanna give more\nThis is what I live for, this is why I do\nWhat I do, It ain't for me, It's for you\n\n\n[hook - repeat once]\nIf you know god is working in your life\nShout it\nIf you know god then youre gon' be alright\nShout it\nIf you know god and you know what he's like\nShout it\nIf you know god then just jump and shout it\nShout it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c768a0855d18bfa64f81a797bb10d78f.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
