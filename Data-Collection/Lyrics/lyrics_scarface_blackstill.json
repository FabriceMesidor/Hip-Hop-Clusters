I demand reparation\nFuck a cowboy, I\u2019m a native robbed of my nation\nI\u2019m an African, Black man, fucked out my language\nGot me praying to a white boy God, that\u2019s insane\nAnd if you ask me, why they steadily harass me\nI reply with that \u201cThese muthafuckas nasty\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m a god yet they calling me a nigga\nThey scared of me, so they try to hide behind the trigger\nActing bad ass, fuck a honkey with a badge\nI\u2019m a nigga with an attitude, you can kiss my black ass\nAin\u2019t no sense in niggas being diplomatic\nTelevise the revolution, let these muthafuckas have it\nI\u2019m calling up the homies, they said to come through\nAnd I run with them niggas ain\u2019t scared to come shoot\nTake an eye for an eye, take a tooth for tooth\nDo unto others as them others would do onto you\nAnd now they saying \u201cMake America Great\u201d\nBut what America hates kept America straight\nAnd America safe, muthafuck that flag\nMy people are not free, we wanna touch that bag\nSo quick to try to copyright what came for free\nNow they blaming me, and it\u2019s plain to see\nThat they mad at that, like I\u2019m a magic act\nYeah, imagine that; muthafucka, I\u2019m Black\nFuckin\u2019 vultures, super quick to steal one\u2019s culture\nTrying to make it your own; caveman, go home\nOver-tan, long nose, funny-looking ass Donald\nGot his nerve disrespecting President Obama\nIf you don\u2019t want us around then let us leave\nPay the money you\u2019ve been owing my peoples as they were set free\nThat 40 acres and a mule never came\nAnd yet we\u2019re still outstanding\u2014out standing in the rain\nJust waiting, patient, pacing, and praying\nFor God to step up, and not ain\u2019t shit shaking\nI was mistaken thinking scripture coulda helped us\nFollowing the faith of our very own oppressors\nNo justice, just us\nLook at how the aftermath of slavery today still affects us\nOur kids educated by the enemy\nAnd they don\u2019t know shit about their history\n\u2018Cause they ain\u2019t teaching that in school\nLeave it up to them coons, and all that\u2019s cool\nLet the bygones be bygone\nAnd besides, we\u2019ve been killing off our own\nShut the fuck up, you know what?\nUncle Tom, house nigga slaves need they muthafuckin\u2019 nuts cut\nI pack steel in the hour of the chaos\nIf Black lives still don\u2019t matter to you, stay out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a8834d350e698012cc58bd228f90719.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
