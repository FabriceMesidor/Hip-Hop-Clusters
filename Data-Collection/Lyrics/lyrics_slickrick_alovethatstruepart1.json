You worthless slut!\n\"Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to\"\nYou know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying\nAnyway, stayed with the creep\nOne day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep\n\"Chris, wait,\" the bum bitch said\nSo loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed\nWho the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance\n'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance\nHad the nerve to dis patch loving\nBoy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing\nWhen I found strength to depart, I do\nWithdrew, for something brand new\n\n[Hook]\nSomeone who would be true\nYes, I should find someone who would be true\nCause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true\nIndeed, I need a love that's true\nIt seems I need a love that's true\nOh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo\nOh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough happy I was free, the need for love was still in me\nGot to the point where the need for it was killing me\nThen I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin\nFound out later how young the bitch was and\nThough I done hit it and she opened up a world\nAnd remind me of that song \"Go Away, Little Girl\"\nIt had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled\n\"That's because I had you pussy whipped royal\"\nYou see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?\nYou see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?\nLike oil and water, impossible mixture\nThen temper tantrums came into the picture\nYelling, carrying on bad and cursing\nComplete embarassment to the Ruler as a person\n\"Gimme shorts\" Ruler will not permit you\nThen she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture\nFlirts too, excuse me, a whore\nLike the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour\nSo when I found strength to depart, I do\nWithdrew, for something brand new\n\n[Hook]\nSomeone who would be true\nYes, I should find someone who would be true\nCause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true\nIndeed, I need a love that's true\nIt seems I need a love that's true\nOh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo\nOh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9492e61c778d8d1c0b9cddf2393d4e25.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
