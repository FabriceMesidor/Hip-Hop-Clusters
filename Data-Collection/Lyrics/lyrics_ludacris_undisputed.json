Titanic dough (what?)\nWomen on my nuts like, \"Where the Titanic go?!\"\nI been scourin the Earth (yeah)\nMakin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church\nAnd the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers\nCan't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen\nAnd I got the women screamin (AHHH!)\nThey could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen\nOr LL Cool - so if your boyfriend\nThinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool\nGot jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)\nIconic status and his name is Ludacris\nBitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s\nWith million dollar whips that I ship from overseas\nGot a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth\nIs that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees\nThe globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt\nAnd put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts\nWhat you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters\nYour fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders\nAnd your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back\nLike when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors\nLike a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt\nThe name of my car insurance is \"YO' FUCKIN FAULT!\"\nAnd if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys\nAnd have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.] + (Ludacris)\nChamp you got it! Keep on movin\nThey ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin\nThese boys'll smile in your face and stab you right in the back (I know)\nBring it, take some water\nThis is Money in the bank! (yeah)\nThey defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)\nYou know what you can do (I know)\nYou Luda! You lookin good, let's go! (aight)\nC'mon baby, hard work and dedication (yeah)\nYou know what it is man (aight let's go)\n{*ding ding ding*} Keep fightin!\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on the scene (what?)\nBack to put a nail in these rappers' coffins\nI got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It\nBarrel stay hotter than\nA fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits\nA-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket\nLuda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics\nAnd acrobatics; I'm superstar status\nThe mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!\nThe international traveler\nAnd I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa\nSo put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty\nLit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up\nYou can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck\nLike I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me\nAnd then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose\nWhen Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free\nI'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was\nLeavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs\nThey shoulda warned ya - you got defeated\nBy the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya\nSo call the coroner (hey!)\nI'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida\nCall me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction\nLike you hit the subway and caught the wrong train\nSo don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets\nRight at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)\nOr else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad\nYou'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it\nBut not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin\nLike comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)\nYou fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)\nAnd I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!\n\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]\nHa ha ha ha!\nI told these muh'fuckers can't fuck with you and me man\nI'm the best of the best, the head honcho\nThe el hombre intachable, man\nYou know what the business is, they can't fuck with me man\nYou know what my lifestyle is\nMan you know what I do, you can't fuck with me man\nWhat, a decade? What?\nI'll go ten more, they can't fuck with me man\nLifestyle, you know what it is\nGettin money man, let's go\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nYeah baby, yeahhhh!\nI'm the champ!
