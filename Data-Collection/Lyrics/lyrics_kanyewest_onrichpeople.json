I am an artist and I care about humanity\n\nYes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family\n\nBut I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world\n\nIf I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up\n\nAlso for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money\n\nI could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you\n\nThere are people who support artist and philanthropist\n\nAnd I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is\n\nI am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more\n\nI am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...\n\nI know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me\n\nThis is a God dream\n\nBut if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart\n\nNo matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle\n\nAnd a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators\n\n\nPeople wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/64f690a1efbb9ca75a69645930e0fa79.498x498x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
