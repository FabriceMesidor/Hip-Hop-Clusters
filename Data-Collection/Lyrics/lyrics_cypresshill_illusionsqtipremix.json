They all fucked up now\nCuz they let a nigga back on the street some how\nI'm looking for some one like me\nLiving in my own world to my own degree\nOn the loose in the city looking at the ho with the titties\nLooking at me and I feel shitty\nA lil tensed up getting hot\nCuz she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot\nI'm trying to find ways to cope\nBut I ain't fuckin around with a gage or a rope\n\n(Hook)\n\nI'm having illusions all this confusion's\nDriving me mad inside\nI'm having illusions all this confusion's\nFuckin me up in the mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5bfb3c1df682504d29cac02d808840bd.600x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
