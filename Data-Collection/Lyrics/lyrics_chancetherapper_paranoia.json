They deserted us here\nWhere the fuck is Matt Lauer at?\nSomebody get Katie Couric in here\nProbably scared of all the refugees\nLook like we had a fuckin' hurricane here\nThey'll be shooting whether it's dark or not\nI mean, the days is pretty dark a lot\nDown here, it's easier to find a gun\nThan it is to find a fucking parking spot\nNo love for the opposition, specifically a cop position\n'Cause they've never been in our position\nGetting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nI've been riding around with my blunt on my lips\nWith the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip\nParanoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz\nBut a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits\nI've been riding around with my blunt on my lips\nWith the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip\nParanoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz\nBut a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits\n\n[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]\nI know you scared\nYou should ask us if we scared too\nI know you scared\nMe too\nI know you scared\nYou should ask us if we scared too\nIf you was there\nThen we'd just knew you cared too\n\n[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nIt just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout\nI hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out\nI hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks\nAnd I ponder what's worse\nBetween knowing it's over and dyin' first\n'Cause everybody dies in the summer\nWanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring\nI heard everybody's dying in the summer\nSo pray to God for a little more spring\n\n[Outro: Chance The Rapper]\nI know you scared\nYou should ask us if we scared too\nIf you was there\nThen we'd just knew you cared too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0dcecefaaf15a4279620dc8b583ed9f.822x822x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
