(What am I to do y'all?)\nMy mind is in a whirlpool (Man I\u2019m going crazy)\nGive me a little hope (I need hope)\nOne small thing to cling to, yeah\nNeva, neva, neva\n\nVerse 2:\nNever let the haters say that you ain't up to par\nNever should you be believin' you are not a star\nNever should you ever think that you can't get that far\nNever should you ever think that you can't get that car\nNever be thinkin' the shit you be doin' will come back around and bite you in the ass, especially if you on woppy (??)\nAnd when you be flowin' then never be using the words I be using if you rappin' fast especially if you gon' copy\nBut that be the reason when I flow I gotta switch it up\nCause I gotta give it to 'em in a way they won\u2019t pick it up\nBut never say never cause when they get the acappella there\u2019s somebody gon' do it better but until then give it up\nSo never say that you can't win if they say you gon lose\nAnd never think you can come up if you don\u2019t make a move\nAnd never believe that you are below anybody because of yo' looks\nYou are the shit, as long as you choose\n\nChorus:\nWhat am I to do? (I don't know)\nMy mind is in a whirlpool (Know I'm talk'n 'bout?)\nGive me a little hope (Yeah)\nOne small thing to cling to, yeah\nNeva, neva, neva\n\nVerse 3 (Twista):\nI see hard crime, a child was runnin' around in the streets\nAnd got caught in a murder now he ain\u2019t gon' never come home\nNever be thinkin' you helpin' by doin' whatever they want\nCause life is hard and he ain't gon' never be strong\nNever believe that the the only way you can stop it\nWhen you take a look at the drama\nPlease take a look at the lama\nNow what you gon' do when you have to look at your Mama?\nNow you can do better than that homie, look at Obama\nAnd then sit, in the back, of the bus, if they don\u2019t, give it up\nOn the way, to the joint, cause you, think you can come up\nYou feelin' like you was invincible until they struck\nWith the right to remain silent, fuck\nNever think that you\u2019re so hard that you can\u2019t get crossed\nAnd never think that you\u2019re so hard that you can\u2019t get soft\nAnd never think that you\u2019re so smart that you can\u2019t get taught\nAnd never think that you\u2019re so smart that you can\u2019t get caught\n\nNeva, neva, neva, oooooooooooh (Sing it, baby!)\nAaaaaaay (Tell \u2019em girl)\nWhat am I to do?\nMy mind is in a whirlpool (feel me?)\nWhat am I to do? (Tell 'em)\nMy mind is in a whirlpool (Know I'm talk'n 'bout?)\nWhat am I to do?\nMy mind is in a whirlpool (Uh)\nGive me a little hope, (That\u2019s all I need)\nOne small thing to cling to\n\nOutro:\n(Oooooooh) Never say never, y'all already know the real, Y'all shawties gon' understand some day (Aaaaaaaaaay)\nGotta live for today, fight for tomorrow\n(Neva, neva, neva, oooooooh, aaaaaaaaaaaay,)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
