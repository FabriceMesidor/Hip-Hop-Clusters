It was dope!\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\n\nUr suppose to want to bite the heads of ur opponents. Hip Hop ain't about hugs and high fives.\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\n\nI personally don't think anyone should have responded. Niggas need to put that energy into makin a classic album and responding that way.\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\n\nId feel this way had he mentioned me or not. Cuz at the end of the day Kendrick showed love, was polite and really genuine when we worked\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\nAnd thats what matters.\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\n\nEvery rapper should want to murder other rappers. Its a joke otherwise\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\n\nIm just happy i lost the \"MOST EMO RAPPER AWARD\" recently ha\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\nTo everyone who felt some type of way by Kendricks verse ha\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\nIts rap. niggas ain't saving lives or feeding the hungry. who caresses\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013\nOk so those are my thoughts\n\n\u2014 Scott Mescudi (@ducidni) August 15, 2013", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57fc91d7548f4e591a971ea7f5443a88.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
