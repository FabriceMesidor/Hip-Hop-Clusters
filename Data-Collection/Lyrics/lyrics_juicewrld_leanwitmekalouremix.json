I don't know, is it over?\nLookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure\n\n[Chorus]\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys\n\n[Verse 1]\nTold her if I die I'ma die young\nEvery day I've been gettin' fucked up\nFinally know the difference between love and drugs\nShawty tell me I should really sober up\nThis shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real\nFuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills\nI'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it\nRing, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'\nI know I'm not right\nBut I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong\nGirl, you hate it when I'm too high\nBut that's where I belong, where I belong\n\n[Chorus]\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys\n\n[Verse 2]: Kalou\nAll my friends and all my bros they turned their back on me\nWhen I'm winning they just come around and clap for me\nThey so bad for me, guarantee, they want me to die and bleed\nShe made me go cry and leave, now my demons flying free\nWanted me to lose but Kalou going up now (huh)\nMight buy AF1's and put them on my bro now (huh)\nMight go buy a rollie shit might be a bust down\nMind your business don't you come and poke your nose round\nCuz if you poke your nose, I'm playing ghost, I'm on a roll, I gotta go\nBut you can't climb up on this slope because the path is for the woke\nMy only true friend is the lord above, I pray he keep my family up and I don't fall to double cups, oh please don't tell me time is up\n\n[Chorus]\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys\nLean with me, pop with me\nGet high with me if you rock with me\nSmoke with me, drink with me\nFucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/983e560247d1b36a2c2a3ccd9ebe8bf6.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
