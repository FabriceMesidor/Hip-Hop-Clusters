This mackin' word is bond\nThere's no other assumption, I got it going on\nI'm not conceited, my friends tell me this\nEven my mother, be noddin' her head to this\nMakes her proud to see her one son get loud\nFlip on a sucker, and bow to the crowd\nDrink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4\nLive in action, guaranteed RAW (dumb ass nigga)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c07521a81ddd8bbc7a71b76725f483c4.758x719x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
