I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that\nBut then you stepped to me \"Damn\" blew my whole spot up\nDropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up\nUhh.. you made me re-evaluate my G\nNow, I'm gangster for you, baby, you gangster for me\nAnd we're walking\n\n[Chorus: Coco w/ Ice-T ad-libbing]\nGo Ice man! \"UHH!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine \"YOU KNOW!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind \"UHHA!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine \"COME ON, GIRL!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind\n\n[Verse Two: Ice-T]\nThe truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets\nTo ever show affection or an aim at direction\nWhen we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride\nAnd my partners got no problems cause they know that you're true\nAnd if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do\nGet low, get the bail money, call up the crew\nYou take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you\nWe'll do old, strolling girl\nYou know how we do, we're just walking\n\n[Chorus: Coco]\nGo Ice man! \"UHH!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine \"UHHA!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind \"YEAH, GIRL!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine \"UHH!!\"\nWalking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind\n\n[Break: Ice-T Talking]\nBreak it down!!\nYeah, you know, it comes at time in every man's life\nPlayer hustler or whatever\nThat he realizes.. that he needs that companionship of the woman\nStrong woman to hold him down, through them cold nights\nThrough them hardships and pains and struggles in the streets\nSTRESS!!\n\nGo Ice man  -----------] Coco\n\n[Verse Three: Ice-T]\nRealized I've grown in life I had to get shot\nBefore I understood; that you come in this world and die alone\nDon't wanna spend my life chasing flash and cash\nI'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash\nThe homies understand and they're looking for girl to their own\nSo they can't get out these streets and stay home\nIt's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine\nAs long as we're together, girl, I know we'll be fine\nCause we're walking\n\n[Chorus: Coco X2]\n\n[Ice-T overlapping the above Chorus]\nUHH!! COME ON!!\nYeah girl, UHH!!\nWe're just.. holding hands.. holding our pistols\nRubbing your booty, yeah baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/44e03781386ef22a962df8d6b6e26c72.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
