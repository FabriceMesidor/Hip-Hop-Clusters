Fish and Grits!\nTake a pic Snap a flick kiss my kicks they pay attention\nMust they finally realize you in the murkin mix\nYou gone pull in line or we gone spit that venom\nI'm thinkin 10 steps ahead I want my own denim\nWe were goin in them stackin every penny\nStretching every nickel over the same strippers\nI gave it to you straight up, right down the center\nWe don't like rappin this car is foreign right down the center\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get this big without tryin\nI'm matchin' by mistake I want that yacht I'm on my grind\nI learn from my mistakes\nYou want it daddy go and get it\nDon't never hesitate\nI'm burnin hotter than some lava and I ain't takin off a day\nThey on my trail, like they tryin' to build a case\nThese rappers worser than them few\nThey watch you spendin' cake\nThey want ya style\nAnd they often imitate\nI set the trend\nAnd I watch them duplicate it\nI'm satisfied with none of this money I'm getting hungry\nI'm breakin' bread with a team young nigga we hit Columbia\nSalute the troops we in them coupes like caprices\nOld school player ridin' in a foreign feature\nChange em up like rentals yeah we change em up like rentals\nRidin' like the president.. I'm presidential\nBlowin' green like ya thought I would\nIt's simple\nI'm coming straight up out my temple\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDo You take the cash to be yo lawfully wedded wife\nAnd Honor this bih for the rest of yo life\nYes I do till death do us part\n365 yay they go hard\nAnd we go home\nCrib so big look like the Georgia dome\nI'm rollin like a rollin stone, they do nothin\nI pick the streets where I belong\nWhat time were we supposed to be\nMaybe its the dro in me\nMy girl got a girlfriend\nLook like she come from overseas\nAin't nothing like these other niggas\nI took the chicken out the bill with her\nShit I done still in her its still in em\nWho introduced you, to jimmy and tory\nChange the color of the bottom of your shoe ya walkin foreign\nGotcha nigga vip\nThat's very important\nI done freestyled\nMore than you lil niggas recorded\n\n[Hook]\nI'm kickin real street talk (I can't make this up)\nImma mofukin boss (I can't make this up)\nYou ain't no extraordinary (I can't make this up)\nMe and money got married (I can't make this up!)\nDo it playa do tha shit (I can't make this up)\nI seen u niggas back in '06 (I can't make this up)\nTurn a club into a crib (I can't make this up)\nBought a ticket in a club (I can't make this up!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7317e7abac3ca19d05f474a34f3a8dce.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
