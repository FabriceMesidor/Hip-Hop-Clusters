Come get with me and perhaps, lady\nYou can help me multiply my stacks, baby\nCurrency seems small, I need companionship\nThrough with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit\nSo why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?\nCheck out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink\nThis be a thug thing, Outlaw nigga with riches\nCream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches\nCheck my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, sippin' on Cristal and Aliz\u00e9\nSmokin' on big weed keyed the Cali way\nDon't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fifth\nI can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch\nLet my pedigree read briefly, they're so cheap\nPuttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief\nMash on my so-called comp, who the man?\nWhile I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head\nUnderstand this: ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z!\nHe broke and I smoke daily\u2014baby, let's be friends!\n\n[Chorus: Singer & (2Pac)]\nLet's be friends (Where my niggas at? C'mon!)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends\n(All my niggas, where my hoes at?)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes?\nLet's be friends! (Where the bitches at?\nWhere the niggas with money? Where you at, baby?)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nI met you and I stuttered in passion\nThough slightly blinded by that ass\nIt was hard to keep my dick in my pants\nEvery time you pass got me checkin' for you\nHardcore, starin' and watchin'\nMe and you, one on one, picture countless options\nWas it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me\nErotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics\nFar from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch\nEverything inside you from my head to my nuts\nYou got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine\nJust a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind\nBack in time, I recall how she used to be\nI guess money and fame made you used to me\nWhat's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag\nFuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!\nBack to you, my pretty-ass caramel queen\nGot my hands on your thighs, now let me in between as friends\n\n[Chorus: singer & (2Pac)]\nLet's be friends (Westside, motherfucker, right here)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends\n(Westside in this motherfucker)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes?\nLet's be friends (Westside in this motherfucker right here)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends\n(In this motherfucker right here)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nCan you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks?\nI got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch\nWas it me or the fame, my dick or the game?\nBet I screamed Westside when I came (Westside!)\nScream my name \u2018cause, baby, it's delicious\nGhetto weak spot for pretty bitches\nUp and down similar to switches\nMy movement, baby, let your back get into it (into it)\nMake it fluid (fluid), in and out, all around when a nigga do it\nYou got me high, let me come inside!\nI love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!\nWho wanna stop me? Am I top notch?\nFuck player-hatin' niggas, \u2018cause they cockblock\nYou probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?\nRather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?\nMade a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed\nA bad seed turned good in this world of G's\nBaby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked\nIt's the fuck song so check my record and let's be friends\nWhere my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at?\nWhere my bitches at? Thug style!\n\n[Chorus: singer & (2Pac)]\nLet's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)\n(Throw yo' guns in the air!)\nFriends\u2026 (My ghetto love song!\nIt goes on and on and on and on)\nLet's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)\n(Where my niggas at?)\nFriends\u2026\u00a0(Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)\n(Where my people at? Let's be\u2026)\n\n[Bridge: 2Pac]\nWhere my people at? Show me where my people at!\nWhere my people at? Show me where my people at!\nAll my niggas now, just my niggas come!\nWhere my niggas at? Just my niggas now!\nBe friends, tell me where my niggas at\nBe friends, tell me where my bitches at\nBe friends, tell me where my people at\nBe friends, tell me where my bitches at\nMake money, take money, be friends\n\n[Chorus: singer & (2Pac)]\nLet's be friends (Get your cash on! Let's get dough!)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends\n(C'mon, get your cash on!)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes?\nLet's be friends (C'mon, get your cash on! Let's get paid!)\nYou ain't gotta be my man at all\nLong as you just bring me your friends\n(C'mon, get your cash on!)\nWhy you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nMake money, take money!\nMake money, take money!\nMake money, take money!\nMake money, take money!\nMake money, take money!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/74b94f4112372859edd6ae711af0df41.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
