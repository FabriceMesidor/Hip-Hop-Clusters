I'm supposed to be dead by 24\nBut if a nigga got that shit it in his head how can he grow?\nI was raised up not to be led by any ho\nGot exposed to the game from a different angle\nWhen you young black and poor there's places you can't go\nAin't no big pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\nStill, I'm thankful\nEven on them hungry days when my belly ain't full\nI know what I came through\nI was raised this way\nN I double-G A\nSucka-free all day every day\nFrom the womb to the grave\nBaptized in the game\nEarly age\nDirty thirty-eight special in my waist\nGetting paid blowing weed like it ain't no thang\nRolling blunts getting drunk and it ain't gon' change\nI let my khakis bang\nWhite tee Chuck T's on my feet\nHollering \"Fuck the Police!\"\nGot some fresh gold teeth - my nigga!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77b2cb0937e1d9604da173026219d5ac.705x706x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
