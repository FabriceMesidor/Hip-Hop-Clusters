Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!\nAnd you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?\nOnly difference between you and me, you were gay\nAwww, did he get his feelin's hurt?\nNawww, he's got titties under his shirt\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway\nWhen you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways\nI say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way\nNiggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV\nAnd seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway\nThen pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay\nWe stay four stars or better\nCause the couches in the rooms got more leather\nAnd we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better\nAnd back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas\nYou still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial\nStay gettin' somethin' off layaway at Marshall's\nPolo and Carbesher's, we into them things dawg\nBack in '96, we was livin' like kings dawg\n40 cal.s or better, tottin' them things dawg\nSo up the Turkish snake, and take them rings off\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9368e74d31ea216d410c02def5b8ec60.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
