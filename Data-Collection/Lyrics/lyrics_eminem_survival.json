Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck\nThrough the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it\nLike G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up\nAnd if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut\nAnd I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook\nMe for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself\nWith a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt\n'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut\nI get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut\n'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust\nIt'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what\nGot me this far, picture me quittin'\nNow draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!\nIt's survival of what?\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]\nThis is survival of the fittest\nThis is do or die\nThis is the winner takes it all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\n(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo\nBut don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle\nThis is it\u2014it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit\nLive, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this\nRefuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick\nIf I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit\nAin't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do\nAs soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit\nBut my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do\n'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit\nSo there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade\nSo you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es\n'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me\nSo, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!\nBut I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve\n'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed\nAnd if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem\nMust be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me\nMy skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me\nI can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be\nAllergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it\nI just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]\nThis is survival of the fittest\nThis is do or die\nThis is the winner takes it all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c496468de3457b84accb4de08b32dfd.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
