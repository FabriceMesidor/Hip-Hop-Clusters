Know what im sayin? Ye-yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, shit's about to jump off and\nLookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north\nBeen like three years since when got knocked\nSince he got caught\nPunked up like five new blocks, holding down for it\nKept a nigga straight with money in the books\nAnd them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks\nTook him shopping, money in his pocket is straight\nDropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate\nOur estate was the next move for me\nHad to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months\nCause when it's on, it's on (thats my plate!)\nHe didn't care\nIt's like slow down baby\nThe money ain't going nowhere (what?)\nKeep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it\nThe dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it\nWatch a nigga just coming home in a game\nCause on the low we may just be trying to go (go down) against the grain\n\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\n\nI never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled\nWhat is strange is the change that niggas go through\nWhen they're locked down and really can't hack it\nA motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket\nStrap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me\nAnd by the end, niggas was like \"Yo, why you killed Mike, D?\nWasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him\nUsed to be my man, so I let my cousin do him (we open up shop! It's four in the mornin!)\nSent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA\nCause the money comes quick\nHalf of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him\nBut things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him\nGot him up out of there and sent him down a little further\nAin't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)\nAnd from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something\nThis hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)\n\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\nI gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)\nI gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)\n\nMan, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic\nFound the safe, checked it\nShit looks detected\nJust what I expected when I got no word from him\nAsked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)\nBut money talks and most niggas is snakes\nSo it wasn't long before his man was ready to take\nMe to where he was at, checked my gat\nThrew in a four clip, pumped myself up\nCause I can't go for that bullshit\nFuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue\nIt's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you\nTakin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so\nNow I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough\nLayin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story\nThe famous \"Oh you didn't know I got robbed!\" story\nTold it's to me he should be grateful to\nFuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do\nNow there's love lost and a double cross\nPointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce\nSo you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly\nFive bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys\nTen g's in the shoebox under the bed\nAnd for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head\nAnd from then, the moral of the story if you missed it\nIs the grand is always gonna be there (why nigga?)\nJust never go against it", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c048ed75e001e7462e2f3445177e4821.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
