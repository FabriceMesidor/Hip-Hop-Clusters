I fight for my hip-hop\nNot everybody can relate to what I been through\nEven though some front and they try to pretend to\nKnow about the life of a kid and the strife\nWhere he has to live in the shadow of a base-pipe\nGood goes to bad, bad goes to worse\nAnd pretty soon he's stealin from his own Momma's purse\nSo clean out ya ears and open up your eyes\nI reach out to touch but somebody moved the sky\nMy stomach is growlin, word is born\nCos all I had for dinner was a can-o-corn\n\n[Hook]\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nAll I had for dinner was a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nBefore I went to school I had a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nI tried to get full off a can-o-corn\nA can-o-corn,a can-o-corn\nThat's all the fuck that we had in the kitchen\n\n[Verse 2]\nA few years later, I pledge allegiance to the set\nI'm growin up but I ain't grown yet\nIt's funny how the strain in a life filled with pain\nCan sometimes leave a bitch stained on the brain\nI'm sittin in the restaurant, guardin my food like a eagle\nPickin up scraps like a seagull\nWaitin on the people at the next table to leave a tip\nSo I can put it in my pocket\nPhoney Easter Bunny,Santa Claus and the stork\nWe was poor as fuck so we ate a lot of pork\nAnd it ain't no motherfuckin way no how\nWhen it come up I let you bring me down\nSo I stick to the boots and I'm down with a MAAD group\nOf gangstas and hoodlums,but you can call em 'scroops'\nGive me liberty or give me death\nCos a man without pride ain't got shit left,huh\nAnd now that I'm older with kids of my own\nI put me in the pot where it used to be a bone\nGet'cha self together,word is born\nCos a man can't live on a can-o-corn", "image": "https://images.genius.com/681f5b81de576ad7ba17ac999a7e7e8a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
