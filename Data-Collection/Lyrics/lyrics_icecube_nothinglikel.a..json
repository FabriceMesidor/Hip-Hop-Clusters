Wade and Chris Bosh know that\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can show you the Palms, Mirage\nThe Taj Mahal to the strip in M-I-A\nI can show the waterfalls from Spain to Prague\nTo the beach in  Saint-Tropez\nI can show you the world girl the world girl\nBut ain't nothing else like L.A\nI can show you the world girl the world girl\nBut ain't nothing else like L.A\nNothing like L.A\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe BET Awards and even the Grammys\nThey always pick L.A. over Miami\nI love Miami, I ain't dissin' Miami\nBut where would you rather get robbed for your Grammy?\nAin't nothing like Sunset Boulevard\nCompton and Watts if you wanna be hard\nWe got it all, what you thought not at all\nIf you sicker than shit, then take a Tylenol\nIt\u2019s just me and my woman versus all of y'all\nAnd we taking a bow for our curtain call\nThe angels are lost, they don't wanna be found\nIf God is looking for them, I can show him around\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1c6e4522c58b032c43433a2345b1bb1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
