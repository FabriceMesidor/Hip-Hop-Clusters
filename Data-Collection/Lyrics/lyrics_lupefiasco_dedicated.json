(Uh!)\nFive dollars on your pay-day\nWent directly to little debbies,blueberry juices,cherry now or laters, and a PayDay\nMade me feel same way, it' was crazy\nIt's not where you live\nBut, where your brain stay\nYeah, thats how she train me\nTransferred that directly into my game, aye!\nLet them old people sit down\nRight now you ain't gotta pay\nStop trying to be grown\nCause your next stop might be gone\nSo with the home of my body being the ghetto\nBut my mind on the moon\nI will soon be the man that I am today\nMy momma can cook, but barely can woop\nStill had me shook. Hey!\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, yeah!\nSometimes a women's worth\nIs measured by a woman's church\nAnd underneath her hijab\nThey path is not of this earth;\nThe street that they walk\nThey just trying to meet the boss\nHomie that might not be looking good to you\nBut they ain't looking good for you\nThey looking good for thou\nWho's the most good looking\n'specially when they looking to\nSo me, and you homie they looking through\nThem scarves don't cover no scars\nThey guard from the stare of ours\nGod willing, they can see the gardens\nSometimes concealing is hard\n'specially when you're living in a place like ours\nWhen those and the powers that be\nLoathing their clothing**\nYou looking good in God shirt, God Shoes, God purse, God hoodie\nJust keep God first, lady and keep rolling. Yeah!\n\n(Chorus x2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
