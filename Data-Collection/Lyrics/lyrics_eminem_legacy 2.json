Am I a martian?\nWhat kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?\n\u2018Cause I don't belong in this world\nThat's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often\nFlyin' off at the handle at my mom\nNo dad, so I am noncompliant at home\nAt school I'm just shy and awkward\nAnd I don't need no goddamn psychologist\nTryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems\nThinkin' he can try and solve 'em\nI'm outside chalkin' up drawings\nOn the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'\nTo myself, either that or inside hidin' off in\nThe corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to\nBe noticed \u2018cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'\nI had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'\nSome cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker\n\u2018Cause he said that I eye-balled him\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Polina]\nAnd if you fall, I'll get you there\nI'll be your savior from all the wars\nThat are fought inside your world\nPlease have faith in my words\n\n[Chorus: Polina]\n\u2018Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'\nWhy am I so differently wired in my noggin?\n\u2018Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'\n\u2018Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit\nBothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara\nThen split, but I don\u2019t give a shit\nI'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman\nNothing is the matter with me\nShit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'\nI bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment\nComplex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that\nI find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it\nHeadphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit\nBut if this is all there is for me, life offers\nWhy bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense\nBut I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience\nWhat about them rhymes I've been jottin'?\nThey are kind of giving me confidence\nInstead of tryin' to escape through my comics\nWhy don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?\nTo put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that\nSay what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him\nGrab hold of my balls, like, \"That's right, fight's on, bitch!\"\nWho woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that\nI could be iconic in my conquest?\nThat's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest\n\n[Chorus: Polina]\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'\nNow I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome\n\u2018Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this\nAnd connect lines like crosswords\nAnd use my enemy's words as strength\nTo try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em\n\u2018Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit\nBy you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit\nNow you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'\nThought I was full of horseshit\nAnd now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'\nMe against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins\nVersus the whole 0-16 Lions offense\nSo bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins\nIt's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins\n\u2018Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers\nYou're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical\nWith this dialogue since '99 Rawkus\nYou don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can\nSuck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass\nIn a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage\nThe most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'\n'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes\nThe best part about me is I am not you\nI'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Polina]\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c354260f9edc6b2e9bf6b06c935a0b8.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
