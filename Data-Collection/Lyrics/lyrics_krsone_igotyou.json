Cause y'all's so damn wack wack\nYou never will learn. That's why the teacha's back\nNow you gon' feel that real golden age rap\n\nUnfolding the gat\nThis ain't no place for no amateur block rap\nRappin' about your hammer is cocked back\nThat means you fuckin' with a six-shooter\nAnd we got big guns that can stop that\n\nAll you hear is klug-clack-klug, klug-clack-klug\nAnd you and your man y'all fall backward\nY'all ain't nothin' but actors, bitin' like Dracula\nKris spit spitacular\n\n[Hook] - 2x\nTo my block - I got you\nFrom the bottom to the top - I got you\nWhen you need that raw HipHop - I got you\nI mean that '94 HipHop - I got you\nIf you ain't got nowhere to go - I got you\nVIP passes to my show - I got you\nCome to my crib, let's take it slow - I got you\nNever forget, you gotta know that - I got you\n\n[KRS-One]\nYou listenin' to the depth of the heat\nI'm omni-hood, that means I rep' every street\nWhen I come around cats get up and eat\nOn the mic I won't let up 'til the end of the beat\n\nI stay tight when I recite and sendin' you heat\nLet's compare, what's your agenda this week?\nMe? I be chillin' out in sacred buildings with my children\nFree as a fly on the ceiling\n\n[Hook]- 2x", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ad42a510e6be3523569fba6178f6bcf5.419x382x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
