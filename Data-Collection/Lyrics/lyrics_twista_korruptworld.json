I was faced with other\nType of problems that had held me back\nCouldn't tell me jack now I'm grown in my own zone\nYou ain't gotta tell me that so come trail me back to a time\nWhen a motherfucker lost his will survive\nMe and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal\nEven had to kill to survive\n\n[Twista]\nI remember when you had my back\nWhen the relative passed and my momma cried\nWhen the house caught flames\nYou collapsed in my arms when you heard that father died\n\n[Psyde]\nI take drama in stride\nEven though I had to go through a thing to get myself together\nStill suffer but the worst is gone\nSo it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter\nBut if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate\nSmoke weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes\nTo keep the kids straight\n'Cause you did straight if your seed proceed\nLong as they keep learning and keep growing up\nRight now to survive in a place that's full of doubt\nAnd about to self-destruct\n\n[Hook: Twista]\nHold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up\nIf you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up\nFor the ones who never gave it up\nTake a champagne glass and raise it up\nMake a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt\nHold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up\nIf you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up\nFor the ones who never gave it up\nTake a champagne glass and raise it up\nMake a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nVisualize in invisible eyes how I individualize\nCritical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land\nWhere the unforgettable dies\nSubliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it\nIf he don't peep it and keep it in check soon\nWomb to the tomb death is in the next room\nIf a nigga ain't realizin' AK's and Tech's doom\nLet's assume another brother wanna laugh at you\nAfter he just took a blast at you\nYou won't have it you killed him\nThere go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you\nTellin' you a stranger must be crazy\nTo step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous\n'Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle\nIf we have two things to bust\nIt's cocaine to us and my brains the dust\nI represent till I'm dead so why try?\nLong as I leave my enemy bust, vicinity crushed\nI don't really give a fuck if I die, so why lie?\nMy people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost\nIt's a plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying\nWith their grandmother's hand on the cross\nSo I take a stand when I talk, ran instead of walked\nTo chalk another victory\nHow you did the caper hid the paper\nBreaking other niggas off is a mystery\nWith the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs\nJust keep comin' up, better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets\nIn a ghetto of a world that's corrupt\n\n[Hook: Twista]\nHold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up\nIf you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up\nFor the ones who never gave it up\nTake a champagne glass and raise it up\nMake a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt\nHold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up\nIf you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up\nFor the ones who never gave it up\nTake a champagne glass and raise it up\nMake a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d3d24875934a3f4e43760767e5f7584d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
