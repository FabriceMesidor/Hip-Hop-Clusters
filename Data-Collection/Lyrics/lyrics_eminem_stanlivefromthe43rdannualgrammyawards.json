We should be together too\n\n[Hook: Elton John]\nMy tea's gone cold\nI'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'd all be gray\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]\nDear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months, and still no word\u2014I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters\nI wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway\nHey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins\n\"In the Air of the Night,\" about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin'\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is\nYou could've rescued me from drownin'\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI loved you, Slim, we could've been together\nThink about it! You ruined it now\nI hope you go to sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream I hope you can't sleep\nAnd you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you\nAnd you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim\u2014shut up, [bitch!] I'm tryin' to talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you\n\u2018Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more\nAnd then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh shoot, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this tape out?!\n\n[Hook: Elton John]\nMy tea's gone cold\nI'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'd all be gray\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now\u2014how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph\nFor your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that [shit] intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this stuff you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that stuff just clownin'\nDawg, come on, how messed up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin'\nOff the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this junk about us meant to be together?\nThat type of crap'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter\nI just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you\nBut Stan, why are you so mad?\nTry to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy [shit]\nI seen this one [shit] on the news\nA couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk\nAnd she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape\nBut they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was\u2026 it was you, damn", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eca6a40f533e6743d5ca7a52cc37286c.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
