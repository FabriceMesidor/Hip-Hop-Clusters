Called home, but now on I'm all alone\nJust Proof, no shine, no friends, just fans\nNo wonder my hands tight where the Internet ends\nI take back most of the flack\nThe stress smokes press me close to the crack\nLike my pops, the ghost of my past\nThyme and Mudd, Jay Dee and Stuckey\nLately I'm lucky, I don't hate me to touch me\nMaybe I'm ugly inside but smilin' to make it\nI love y'all, dawg, and that's however you take it\nThe fame is an illusion, I'm still losin'\nIn this game, with the rules and I feel clueless\nThe streets with the hills blueless\nCops knockin' at the door, got me lookin' real foolish\nBut I still do this, like I love it\nEven though I thug it, keep flossin' lights in public\nThe subject y'all don't know\nStars won't grow, wounded dreams with scars to show\nMinus the MTV videos with Slim\n\"Up in Smoke,\" D-12, and many shows with Em\nIt's still me, dawg, no change for change\nIt's strange, when it pours it rains; I take it back\n\n[Hook]\nI wish I could take it back\nI wish I could take it back, but it's too late\nI wish I could take it back\nI wish I could take it back, but it's too late\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlways talkin' to Snook, hopin' he speak back\nWishin' my first son was here to reach at\nFeelin' detached; my brother Earl, and Wayne\nThat bail money for jail, y'all can keep that\nI've been deep before, ask Stillman\nMy heart's meltin', tell the truth I need help, man\nMy heart's big, but my sins bigger\nFuck the world, I don't feel like I can win, niggas\nIt's like I'm lost and I find only demons\nI wanna quit, it's like I'm tired of breathin'\nSo my stress confess to a famous song\nEm, I love you \u2014 don't let this money change us, dawg\nFirst born, when I'm gone, grab Nasaan\nLeave Naeem with the cream and his mom\nAnd dear Momma, I used to hate you\nNow I relate to everything you did to make Proof\nI love you! Take it back\u2026\n\n[Hook]\nI wish I could take it back\nI wish I could take it back, but it's too late\nI wish I could take it back\nI wish I could take it back, but it's too late\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll y'all see is Free from 106 and Park\nY'all don't know I risk my heart with this apart\nFrom the streets, the groups, the friends, the foes\nThe jewels, the dick lickers and the hoes\nWhat about me? Sheltered with no guidance\nLook at the finest, royal highness on some hot shit\nStill livin' with the liquor and bud\nSometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugz\nI wish it was real between us all\nIn the past, you should've seen us, dawg\nI'd die for Em and save Hailie\nBrave maybe, but just let them tears roll off my grave, Shady\nKuniva and Swift, how live does it get?\nI meant to teach y'all niggas to survive in this bitch\nIf we die to be rich, that makes me happy\nAnd on another note, shit, don't hate me, Pappy\nIt's just that we look the same; you let the game take you\nYour son came along and took the game\nSince I took my own life, y'all feel a killer for sho'\nBizarre, on the real, you the realest nigga I know\nStrappin' and bustin' ain't real, just tell your mans the truth\nAnd that's why you've always been friends with Proof\nAnswer to all, I've always lied with truth\nAnd before I pull the trigger, Denaun, I'm proud of you\n\n[Outro]\nListen\u2026 LISTEN\u2026\nLove\u2026 killed me\nLove\u2026 Love\u2026 killed\u2026 me\nLove\u2026 killed\u2026 me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ab9a6517cd52ed1370641d9d44571fdd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Proof"}
