Tuesday was cute, Wednesday was the real freak. Hump day. Know what I'm sayin'? Keep in the Rolodex. Thursday, she was fine but I always wanted to jump off for Friday and Saturday. But God introduced me to Sunday. And I knew Sunday was special\n\n[Verse One] [Keisha Shontelle]:\nOn Sundays\nI always\nLike to watch the ballgames\nAnd stay all day\nCh-ch-chilling at the park with\nA couple of my homies\nWatchin' people walkin'\nEverybody's talkin', laughin', runnin'\nIt's funny\nWho you bump into when you take the long way\nEverybody's hungry\nPropane's got the grill smokin'\nIt feels like a 100\nBut it's okay\nIt's lovely (how we) that way (until) Sunday\n\n[Hook] [Keisha Shontelle]:\nWe at the car wash, trippin'\nGot the chrome wheels, spinnin'\nLemonade, we sippin'\nAll the kids, skippin'\nGranny is cookin'\nCan't wait till Sunday\nParlay, all day\nSunday\n\n[Verse Two] [Keisha Shontelle]:\nThe pool is open\nMakes me wanna jump in\nCall my peeps and they are comin'\nIt's gon' be on and poppin'\nMusic's playin', heads are bobbin'\nWe sippin' on some Kool-Aid\nEverything is everything\nIt's just like the old days\nWith your family\nCelebrate, you work all week, it's time for a break\nKick back and, relax your feet, pass the cornbread\nCollard greens and chicken\nStand outside and smell the kitchen\nWe gon' be dancin' (soon as) you turn on that music\n\n[Chaundon]:\nThat's when it all goes down\nSuper Bowl barbeque, friends and family around\nGod's day off\nSix days of puttin' in work\nHear a word from the pastor at the A.M.E. church\nIt's such a beautify day, I'm dressed to the nines\nWalkin' down Fordum Road every lady's a dime\n(On Sundays)\nI give my momma a call\nLet her know I'm doin' alright, no problems at all\n(You got your rent paid)\nCheck\n(Your lights on)\nYup\nYou taught me how to walk so I ain't missin' a step\nI'm a grown man now with a bad case of Mondays\nSteady reminiscing on a old Easter Sundays\nNew clothes, hard boiled eggs, Easter baskets\nWishin' I could go back and relive the classics\nOh well, them days are done\nBut hey, I can't complain there's more Sunday's to come\nYa know?\n\n[Keisha Shontelle]:\nBack in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Hook] [Keisha Shontelle]:\nWe at the car wash, trippin'\nGot the chrome wheels, spinnin'\nLemonade, we sippin'\nAll the kids, skippin'\nGranny is cookin'\nCan't wait till Sunday\nParlay, all day\nSunday", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c79a4d23ca0ae75f715c34ad0ae3825a.492x486x1.jpg"}], "artist": "9th Wonder"}
