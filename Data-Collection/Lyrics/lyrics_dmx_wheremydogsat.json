I lay my dick down\nYou can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst\nYou gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse\nNiggas play poker, I play poke-her\nHit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a83aa2064f0cf2f07b1c8f34f2c70406.240x240x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
