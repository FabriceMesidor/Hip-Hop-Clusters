Howl!\nI got the night vision just like the wise old owl\n\nI'm comin' ta fetch ya\nYeah home direct ya\nBury them bones\nUnder my home and\n\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!\n\nTake my weapon, step into a whole new realm\nAnd step back, as I take up the helm\nOn the pirate ship I'm steerin'\nDroppin' the geran\nJust realize what you're hearin'\n\nThe cannon sounded\nThat's my companion: surrounded\nAs my crew comes bounding\nAs the captain\nAfro-america\nWhole lotta gattin'\nWith the loc'ed out latin\n\nBusted!\nYou're a red beard with a musket\nBetter talk quick cause ya might get dusted\nYour gatt looks rusted, disgusted\nOh look away, look away boy as I rush it\nYes I know that you can't withstand it\nWatch that ass cause punk I'll brand it\n\nWith a steel-toe, how you feel now\nWhen my boot stuck in that ass like a dildo\nCry on a pillow, weepin ass willow\nThe Hill got the skill for the static like brillo\n\nHmmm, what you talkin' `bout punk\nGimme room as I light up the boom\nCock the hammer, wave the white banner\nEver heard a Glock go `click' like a camera?\n\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!\n\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!\nCock the hammer!\nCock the hammer, it's time for action!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4b9ab5e19ad3cb61a9b3e1bf8fc39c50.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
