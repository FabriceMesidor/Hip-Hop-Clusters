NOTHING could stop me...\n..Three songs later..met the first... Nice body...!\n..a good lookin' girl--\nFrom her voice, I could tell she was a Brooklyn girl..\nThe world stopped...It seemed to vanish..\nI asked what she was...half Black, half Spanish..\nNot that it mattered, just conversatin..\nShe went to the bar and I took her invitation...\nCHORUS\nHere and now..you've got to live your life...\nDon't worry how-- just go hard tonight..\nC'mon--Dance like it don't matter...\nVERSE 2\nEverybody move, nobody front...\nIt was February--Black history month..\nI turned my beeper off so I wouldn't be on call..\nThere were 99 bottles of beer on the wall..\n..but..none would fall...so I started to reach..\nShe had two orgasms and a sex on the beach..\nSuch each...ice cube..and still wanted more..\nYou know what I was thinkin'? Mmmm..Lipstick on a straw...\nI said to the cutie \"This is where hello stops..\"\n...then I flavored her tongue with three different jello shots..\n..tasted it off her, her eyes got softer..\nShe said \"You gonna dance now?\" -- I said \"Thanks for the offer...\"\nLost all control; the strobe lights was blinding...\nKrs was rhyming...this girl was grinding..\nMy inhibitions were totally shattered..\n...and that's when she told me to \"Dance like it don't matter...\"\nCHORUS\nHere and now..you've got to live your life...\nDon't worry how-- just go hard tonight..\nC'mon--Dance like it don't matter...\nVERSE 3 - Krs-One\nDance like it don't matter, on stage a dope rapper...\nI see Greenie on the dance floor--- go dada!\nPockets don't grow skinny they grow fatter..\nMusic pumpin' so damn hard, the glass shatters..\n...but...there's Greenie, dancin' to the CD..\nI'm gonna be me, I hope this cat sees me..\nParty all packed and the drinks are goin' up..\nWhile KRS raps, it's Greenie blowin' up\nDancefloor.. I got the whole spot leanin...\nHear it, the spirit--you got the whole place fiendin'..\nReal emceeing, real streets you seein'..\nKickin' live lyrics to live huiman beings..\nThis is what we do, we're not in a trance..\nLike my man Lelu, we like to dance..\nCan you dance? Can you move your body?\nCan you move somebody? Are you new in the party?\nThere's the hottie--but her man got the shotty..\n...and I'm the emcee that puts the boogie in your body...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9fa55af2e8bfddf3b40ea0e0347874f.556x556x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
