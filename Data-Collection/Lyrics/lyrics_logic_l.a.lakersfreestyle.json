I mean that shit sincerely\nI am merely the 2nd Renaissance to the fullest\nIt's all love from up above\nKeep a gat in the glove just in case\nIntroduce you to Christ like Mase, sike nah!\nAll of you know that Logic keep the peace\nBut my brothers keep a piece in the streets, You got it? Capisce?\nSee that's a life I never wanted but I grew up in\nAnd did a lot of dumb shit I'd never do again, What!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
