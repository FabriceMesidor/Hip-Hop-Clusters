Where is it at?\nI haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?\nYou'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis\nUntil you throw up your own liver (nuts)\nI don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow if I stop being who I am, that would upset me\nI'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats\nI struggled to change for J. Christ to accept me\nI don't even change clothes, shit not even my bed sheets\nWhen I step inside the booth and rhyme\nRappers commit suicide\nAnd jump in front of a moving semi-truck\nLike it was cool to die\nNiggas is watered down\nFuck it it's time to scuba dive\nBetter get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive\nKillin' rappers like I condone violence\nI murder you and when your soul is floatin' to hell I ghostride it\nYou won't last living in this cold climate, so don't try it\nI know I'm ill, I don't need no pussies to co-sign it\nCommercial niggas thinking they carry the torch\nIt's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse\nSo next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple\nI'll jump kick your ass through the glass of the booth window\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder\nI'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister\nMurder, nigga murder\n'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up\nMurder, nigga murder", "image": "https://images.genius.com/89f3b594c1d21cb0ced76a0e54600701.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
