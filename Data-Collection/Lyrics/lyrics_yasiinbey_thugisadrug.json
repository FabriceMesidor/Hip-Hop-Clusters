Or super duper high?\nOr contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide?\nTell the truth...\nTaken medicine for trouble in your mind?\nOr taken down a number? For taking up a scheme?\nI made her wild, beautiful take her 'til she skeet?\nTake her to the penthouse or take her to the skreet?\nTell the Truth...\nSo the waterman he take it to the beat\nAnd I take it to the 'mic\nSo we takin' what we like\nTake it to your neck\nWe gon' take it to the bank\nTriple X, Killa K\nBlack we take it to your face\nLike, G...\n\n[Hook]\nBang! Bang! Gangsta\nBirth sign is danger\nIt's like thug is the drug\nThat make 'em fall in love\nWhen love don't love nobody\nBang! Bang! Gangsta\nStar sign is danger\nIt's like thug is the drug\nReady rock, steady pump\nMan they leanin' and they fiendin'\nCuz they can't get enough...\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Dee-Jay play this song in the dance\nAnd every buggy on the block got the tune on blast\nThe TV is like the radio with visuals too\nSo shiny, so gutter, mean moody and cool\nTell the truth...\nThey might be doing things that you wanna' do\nYou fantasize as they be living it through\nThe big home with the beautiful view\nYou have a swim in the pool, and get fresh\nAnd take a spin in the coupe\nTell the truth...\nYou probably want to feel the world in your palm\nWhile hold a gun in your hand\nAnd make 'em know you a star\nTell the truth...\nAnd there's those who probably already are\nThey well known in they zone\nOr they town or they block\nTell the truth...\nThen there's the rest who are usually not\nAnd the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got\nSo they ready to rock...R-r-rock...\n\nHa, ha, heh\n\n[Hook]\nBang! Bang! Gangsta\nBirth sign is danger\nIt's like thug is the drug\nThat make 'em fall in love\nWhen love don't love nobody\n[Gunshots] (Screaming) Gangsta\nStar sign is danger\nIt's like thug is the drug\nReady rock, steady pump\nMan they leanin' and they fiendin'\nCuz they can't get enough...\n\n{*beat rides out*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50acba8e30cec066c838d6f22dd475e3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
