I'm screaming \"this is the life\"\nIf you ain't hoopin' then you whipping the white\nOr either hitting the white\nI talked to em try to give them advice\nNiggas get left, they wasn't living too right\nYeah! Uh, niggas get left, they wasn't living too right\nY'all don't really hear me tho", "image": "https://images.genius.com/444ab187fd5c557d6d65efc6fb8931ea.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
