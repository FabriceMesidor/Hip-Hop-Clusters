Yessir (Amen!) Church\n(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die\nAli recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind\nI'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined\nI'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline\nI climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine\nAnd that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky\nAnd don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply\nAnd tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite\nAnd I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride\nOr knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die\nA suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide\nCSI just might investigate this fucking parasite\n(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me\nAim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony\nFerragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s\nNigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me\nDead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail\nThat say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe\nWrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence\nWhistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D\nBetter be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q\nSolar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do\n\n[Chorus]\n(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him\n(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen\nGot me breathing with dragons\nI'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard\nI'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper\n(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know\n(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen\nGot me breathing with dragons\nI'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard\nI'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper\n\n[Verse 2]\nI rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA\nMy pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor\nWe all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?\nYour hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty\nAnd it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come\nA lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money\nThe sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete\nI don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks\nAnd I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC\nReally ballistic, anybody can see\nAny assistance, everybody deceased\nI'm persistence, recognize I be\nReally too vicious, the permanent beast\nAnd the demolition, breaking up the street\nBetter partition, better dot your T\nAnd I gon' mention, how the far you see\nPutting my dick in the rap industry\nEverybody bitching, getting mad at me\nRecognize Kendrick in the battery\nAnd I'm charged up, and the catastrophe\nIs charged up, and the audacity\nOf y'all fucks never could hassle me\nAnd y'all luck just ran out, you'll see\n\n[Chorus]\n(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know\n(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen\nGot me breathing with dragons\nI'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard\nI'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper\n(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know\n(He dead!)
