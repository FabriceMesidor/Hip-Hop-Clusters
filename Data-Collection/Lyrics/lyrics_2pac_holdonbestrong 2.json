You got to stand strong\nAnd when these bustas try to knock you out your place\nYou stand there to they face\nTell 'em \"Hold on!\", and be strong\nThe game don't stop, huh\nThis here is black, man\nIf you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing\nIt don't stop, 'til the casket drop\nThug for life... feel me?\nAll my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong\nWhen things get bad\nEspecially come the first and the fifteenth\nStay strong, and stay ballin', hold on\nI'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f924e981b74c6d754d2c9da26f83f15.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
