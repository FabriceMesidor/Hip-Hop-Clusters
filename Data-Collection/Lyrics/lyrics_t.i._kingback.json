This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains, while fighting for survival in the streets, to become a great leader! And in time, that boy will grow to become... KING!\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nTime to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)\nI welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge\nRespected from East to West like he was running the mob\nDictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God\nI know you niggas is broke cause I know what you charge\nThem niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage\nIt's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari\nYou niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry\nFuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley\nCause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly\nNow you see that we ain't able to compete, now are we?\nAnd pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story\nOf the A, where I stay niggas stay down for me\nYou want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me\nAnd get a order for killers to spray rounds for me\nCompetition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me\nYou reppin the A horribly, must I say? More importantly\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nThe king back!\nNigga the king back\nYou betta lean back\nNigga the king back\n\nThe king back!\nNigga the king back\nShawty you seen that?
