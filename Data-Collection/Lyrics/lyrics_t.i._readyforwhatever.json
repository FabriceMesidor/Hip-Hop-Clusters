You can talk all you want, mayne, you know what I'm saying? Everybody talk to the King, you know what I'm sayin? Everybody's entitled to an opinion, you know what I'm sayin? They like yesterdays, everybody got one\nBut the fact of the matter remains: if you ain't walk a mile in my shoes and you ain't lived a day in my life, you ain't survive the shit I done survived, you ain't had to deal with the shit I had to deal with, homeboy\u2014you can't muhfuckin' judge me, partner\nI mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor. You know what they said?\nThey said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?\nNow, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?\nNow, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner\nAy, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?\nIf you don't understand that, you don't understand English.
