nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it\nThat's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault\nNow I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops\nBaby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way\nYou mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain\nYou'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with\nAnd that's the moment I say, \"I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it\"\nLet's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house\nEverywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?\nShit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'\nWe do it way too often, I think we both lost it\nOur love just might be in the coffin, oh shit\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems\nSee, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom\nNow your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive\nThen I'm like \"Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?\" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'\nI've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it\nI don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it\n'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way\nThen all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay\nBut don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up\nEvery time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada\nYou say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do\n'Cause I don't want nobody else but you\nI know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me\nSo baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy do we fight so often?\nThese games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us\nWe just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it\nAnd if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient\n\n[Verse 3]\n'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'\nAnd I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'\nIt's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up\nAnd I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once\nMan, this shit be frustratin' me\nIf you ain't the one then who may it be?\nWe tried to make love, but we made a beast\nNow we just stuck 'cause we can't agree\nThis is my heart, please take a piece\nAnd put it in a safe place to remind you\nThere's a million other guys in the world to choose\nBut none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love\nI don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe\nAin't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me\nAin't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love\nAin't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love", "image":
