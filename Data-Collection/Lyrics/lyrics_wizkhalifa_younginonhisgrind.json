Then fuck with Wiz nigga!\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nMoney on the mind\nHustling all the time\nAll about the paper cause the youngin' on his grind\nYoungin' on his grind\nYoung--Youngin' on his grind\nYoungin' on his grind\nYoung--Youngin' on his grind\nMoney on the mind\nHustling all the time\nAll about the paper cause the youngin' on his grind\nYoungin' on his grind\nYoung--Youngin' on his grind\nYoungin' on his grind\nYoung--Youngin' on his grind\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nOkay\nListen fam, I hear you man but I'm just a little hotter\nWiz get going and it be hard for you to get him off ya\nYoung monster, chumps get slumped often\nNigga want to touch my flow?
