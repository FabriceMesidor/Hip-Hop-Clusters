So all you hoes can eat a dick up and die\nWhile I puff the magic dragon, heat the weed up and fly\nTuck your tail between your legs, ya'll ain't made for this shit\nWorth a hundred million dollars, ya'll ain't paid for this shit\nI'm talking Empire Building, we got Prada flows\nAnd y'all so pussy you should fit in Lady Gaga's clothes\nNobody really wanna go there with me\nNobody really wanna say my name\nNobody wanna put the pedal to the metal\nAnd meet me up in the ghetto we can throw them thangs\nWhen I come up to the spot, in the drop top\nWith the Glock cocked, that'll make a nigga pop lock\nLudacris, I'mma hot shot, straight up out the block\nWith a knot that'll get a nigga block knocked (OW!)\nSomebody tell 'em that I ain't playin with 'em!\nPut a pussy nigga 6 feet deep in the ground and you'll be layin with 'em\nI just been watchin over, from my mighty throne\nYa'll Roberto Duran, so just leave it alone\n\nNo Mas! No Mas!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5482bdd9a892ee8a85e236881855cbce.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
