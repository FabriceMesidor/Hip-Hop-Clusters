The High Life and I'm gone\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nMy plane comin' down and I'm happy to land\nEvery time I got to go my girl grabbin' my hand\nTryna' to pull me back to her, and as mad as I am\nI gotta make this money I'm a travelin' man\nSo through airplane, boat, or packed in a van\nBaby I'mma hurry back to you as fast as I can\nIt don't matter what I gotta do, dreams I gotta follow you\nLove is what I fall into, and ever do I follow through\nSo I'mma put it all on you, just know that I ain't got a clue\nBut baby I be watchin' you, and coppin' you some Prada shoes\nHurt me when I watch the news, the doctor's in the hospitals\nTryna' to heal the sick, but all their chances is impossible\nGivin' the word like literature\nSpittin' the verse, for all of those who live in the Burg\nI travel the word the land and the seas\nHere to open up your mind, just hand me the key\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Mac Miller]\nI'm leaving on a jet plane\nAnd don't know when I'll be back again\nKiss me and smile for me\nTell me that you'll wait for me\nHold me like you'll never let me go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
