Man the four wheelers look so good on the sand\nTee or tanktop pocket fan\nNo pocket knife, no handgun in sight\nJust that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat BOOM!\nHa ha tonight I might just boost my feature price\nCause to each its own and the lights is bright\nAnd I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight\nI'm from Cita house big momma's house\nShe told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out\nAnd he ain't getting up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot\nHold up the beat might drop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/98c56aa11e01a9c25b7485cc3a25c78f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
