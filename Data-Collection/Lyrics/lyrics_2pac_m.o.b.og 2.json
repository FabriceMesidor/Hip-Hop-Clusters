you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nNow I been known to bust on sight\nGod bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life\nBeen raised in violence homicide's my lullaby\nHang with the homies and learned to kick it until we die\nBoss players you wonder why\nI live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride\nBitches and niggas in penitentiary suits\nI send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops\nAs for these females, I got no time, I gotta get mine\nYou cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime\nMy time as shorty was full of car chases\nWhile runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's\nNiggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew\nA million niggas with automatics who swarm through\nYou wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert\nCause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Verse 2: Hussien Fatal]\nI blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop\nAll you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots\nI beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me\nActin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty\nYou don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage\nFrom here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence\nFrozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya\n1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers\nWhen I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al\nBacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile\nBag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you\nI got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew\nThis type of shit I do for a petty hobby\nFuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Verse 3: Mopreme]\nMy shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino\nComin' with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo\nThis is not for all the freaks in short skirts\nThis is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt\nLose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja\nBitches is a cobra with deadly venom\nMove as smooth as I get 'em, stackin' G's\nMy niggas crosstown got ki's\nHoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches\n(Nigga!)\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Verse 4: Big Syke]\nI'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches\nThe struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches\nI'm contribed to strive never laggin'\nDisappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'\nAs I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck\nPager blowin' up but I don't give a fuck\nI'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'\nLoc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven\nSo what can you do for me and what can I do for you\nBut stay true, and do the things that we do\nBlinded evil-minded no option for my offspring\nReminded can't find it complications what the future brings\nLosin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time\nI'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind\nRather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches\nI'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]\nThat's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin', I hope he awoken\nPayin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a Glocks smokin'\nMoney and power watch these bitches cause they scandalous\nGettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles\nAin't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler\nCowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya\nMe and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks\nDeuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops\nGettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches\nWhile uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\nM.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks\nAnd you know we keep it money over bitches\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nThat's right nigga\nMoney over motherfuckin' bitches\nM.O.B. on 'em nigga\nKeep your motherfuckin' mind on your money, fuck these hoes\n(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin' bitches\nYou need some motherfuckin' money\nGet your mind right nigga, keep your game tight\nPlay right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools\nWe up out of this bitch here\nBIATCH!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist":
