For the lights in the night\nThe way yours eyes glow, you make me want to have your sight\nDamn I dug my own trenches, yeah, I hide my own pistols\nI survived in the coldest winter, these beats is my only dinner\nYou can't blame a nigga, they tryna hang a nigga\nI mean like every time a nigga blink I'm throwing on the mink\nAnd she don't want to dance unless she drink\nWill this Pharaoh make it out his sphinx?\nBookmarked a lot haters, I added more links\nRolling with the same niggas who was rolling with niggas that was on E\nWonder why I see the stars in the afternoon\nFloating at night when you can catch me right under the moon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d7c20b1db81c7a4cd9dffe5e0ec9ecaa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
