(Why?)\n'Cause a hoe's a trick\nI don't love them tricks (Why?)\n'Cause a trick's a bitch\nAnd my dick's constantly in her mouth\nAnd turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now\nI once had a bitch named Mandy May\nUsed to be up in them guts like everyday\nThe pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung\nI was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue\nThe homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good\nBut I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood\nSo I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine\nGuess what? Got gaffled by one time\nI'm back to the motherfucking county jail\n6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail\nI get's released on a hot sunny day\nMy nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre\nScooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news\nYour girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues\nI ain't been out a second\nAnd already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking\nMove up the block as we groove up the block\nSee my girl's house, Dre, pass the Glock\nKick in the do', I look on the flo'\nIt's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)\nI uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed\nMan, fuck a bitch!\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGet's the fuck out after you're done\nAnd I hops in my ride to make a quick run\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGet's the fuck out after you're done\nAnd I hops in my ride to make a quick run\n(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch\nBut I and her know that they can't fade this\n'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing\nI'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing\nI say you know can't deal\n'Cause I'm a bitch that's real\nMotherfucker need to step back, hell yeah\nThey need to chill\nBecause I don't give a fuck\nAnd I don't give a fuck\nAnd I don't give a fuck\nI don't give a fuck\nAnd now I gotta do some\nI gotta do some shit that's clean\nBut when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean\nLike a washing machine\nI can wash the clothes\nAll the hoes knows\nThat I'm on the flow ho\nBut they can't hang with my type og swing\nI ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang\nBut just the juicy ones\nWith he tip of the tongue\nAnd then their sprung\nWith the nuts hung\nBitches ain't shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c99dd335733f9c3cf16f57c9f589cfb.361x361x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
