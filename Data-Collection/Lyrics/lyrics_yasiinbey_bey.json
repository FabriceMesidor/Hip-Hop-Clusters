(Underdog)\n\nBey\nSoft shoulder, imported cotton, single button\nI ain't gotta talk loud to be sayin' somethin'\nThey doin' them, I'm doin' this\nI'm too legit... Why would I quit?\nThey brains in they ass, what they talkin' with\nYou can smell it on they breath, they just talkin' shit\nGet a tic-tac and get back\nOr get jacked.... Rack-a-lack\nScared of who? Not at all, not nobody here\nNot nobody comin', not nobody there\nTrill, therefore movin' on\nThe simple shit don't move me move along\nBey\nSurname of the sovereign\nOr raised in the belly of the beastly as Gotham\nStill clean so nice it's mean\nFlaco el guapo Boogeyman Yasiin\nSomebody said I was a star\nThey got it right\nMy black is brighter than the dark... Ha\nMy black is brighter than the dark... Ha\nMy black is brighter... Bey\nMy black extra and longer like February 31st, 2/32, or February 33rd\nIf I die today remember me like I'm me\nFlaco el guapo Boogeyman Yasiin Bey\nI was born at dawn\nI was born at dawn\nBirth name Dante I was born a don\nYasiin Dante at it on to dawn\nYasiin Dante that's just more of Dawn\nLord... Forgive 'em what they know not\nCool 'em off and out open pie and closed shop\nBey Coffee too strong they can't sleep well\nUp top flow chilly chill freeze help\nBrooklyn shoulders broad eatin' well and small\nBelly forever flat my motto never whack\nBigger house bigger v ain't a bigger man\nCause they better off don't mean they better than\nLord... Forgive 'em what they know not\nSouped up and flood water to your stove top\nBey wide awake haters can't sleep well\nPro-flow ice cold chilly chill... Freeze\nYeah I'm a star they got it right\nMy black is brighter than the dark\nMy black is brighter than the dark\nMy black is brighter....\nBey", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ce0e2c6d6ae9fec90c32c39501778107.557x557x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
