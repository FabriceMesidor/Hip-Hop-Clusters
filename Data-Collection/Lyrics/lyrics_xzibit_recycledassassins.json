Joe and Tonka trucks\nBut I want butts, livin' first class deluxe\n15 years old soldier ready to serve these clucks\nMy older brother was touched\nIt's a game where you don't play gotta have cane\nCrack house for my birthday\nThe next day my brother shot in cold blood by the police\nIn a rage he lived but he paid the price\nCaught with keys 25 to life\nTakin' in by the crew time to stand on my own two (c'mon nigga)\nBut as I marinated thinkin' about the hood\nI really can't remember my body doin' good\nFor long big decisions somebody got to make 'em\nUndercover recognize the face now can't shake a\nPhone tap (what) and now I'm in the belly of the beast\nUse to sittin' in leather sheets now I'm sittin' awaitin' release\nVisitors day, my younger brother came down\nPut the toys down excited about the first round\nHe bust I was crushed to finally see\nThe solution to the problem could of started with me\nIt's on now\n\n[Chorus: Montage One]\nThere's no escape from the ones who harassin'\nThe reason for the illin' is the reason for askin'\nNow I try to school 'em on the killin' and blastin'\nBut season after season they recycle assassins now\n\n[Outro]\nThere's no escape!\nBut all my people in the struggle\nMove on\nDedicated to the memory of [?]\nMr. X to the Z right\nYeah, get it done\nHold it down\nHard times [?]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cbec7b745c109ceb67758132235acd9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
