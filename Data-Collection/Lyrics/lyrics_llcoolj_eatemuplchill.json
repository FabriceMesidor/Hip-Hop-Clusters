No one knows\nLike I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's\nI know my abc's and my p's and q's\nJust chill and listen to the rhyme cruise\nAll aboard, the cod is a reward\nSome were ignored when they toured for they bored\nThe crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed\nTook a crack of the 40 and went to show 'em how\nYou like me now, but you didn't before\n'Cause you forgot I was raw\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Interlude]\nAh\nFuture of the funk, ah\n(Go 'head, baby)\n(Do it)\nGo 'head, baby\n(Do it)\nYeah\n(Do it)\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Yo, eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's so visual the way I'm throwin' down\nVisualize MC's goin' down\nIn a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes\nThe moral of the story is: I'ma get mines\nI saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that\nYour rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap\nDon't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'\nHe wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'\nYou better notify your next of kin\n'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin\nIf you wasn't prepared then you ought to be scared\nBut even if you was you're aware what the rhyme does\nI remember when you was an amateur\nWritin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature\nBought the album, analyzed the style\nTisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child\nI'm unique when I speak to a beat\nAnother rapper'll fall when the mission's complete\nI daze and amaze, my display's a faze\nEvery phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays\nThe competition that's lost in a freestyle\n'Cause on the mic I'm the golden child\nWith the magical wand that they're callin' a mic\nAnd when MC's approach it turns into a spike\n\n[Chorus]\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat 'em up, L)\nWhy don't you just chill?\n(Eat 'em up, L)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah\nI wanna say what's up to my man Kool Herc\nAnd my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation\nKnow what what I'm sayin'\nMy man Marley Marl and DJ Clash\nMy man B-Blast\nRush Town\nDef Jam\nWe in the house\nOf course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD\nYeah\nI get busy\nPeace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22e65b653eb6ded3289c8de99a5e66f7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
