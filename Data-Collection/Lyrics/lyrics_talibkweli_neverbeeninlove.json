Proceeds my name up on the headstone\nLeave her be for five minutes\nDudes try to dive in it first\nThey want to spit on my name and tarnish my image\nI tell them do you I don't care who she speaking with\nBecause I already know she made it clear who she leaving with\nAnd it feels so beautiful\nPut it in a rhyme because it feel so musical\nPlus you ain't no groupie ho\nSitting in the studio\nBefore we do this though there something that you should know\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/621202e462c9992659e0beea9b8fe5f9.320x317x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
