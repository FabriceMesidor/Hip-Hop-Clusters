Yeah, living legend\nThey say nothing worth having comes easily\nLet's go get in, buzz it down and spread it out evenly\nCamouflage my rides, blend with the scenery\nAnd bang in the face of my enemy\nDivine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family\nBloodline, prepare for the best, through tough times\nFifty car caravan, anything jumping\nGot the wheel real big with the rims still rubbing\nBut my rims ain't touching, I'm a Defcon button\nI'm a Russian made Kalashnikov, motherfucker\nThe same thing that builds you up, ain't reserve notes\nWatermarks stacked, In God We Trust\nBut any man can and will be crushed, heaviest move like elephant tusk\nThink you better adjust the way you approach, don't get too close\nBecause you might get hit with a shitbag, and a wheelchair dented in zig-zag\n\n[Hook]\nLegacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king\nStories of the hood, lights, the fame bring\nWe runs the past, the strong survive\nFor perfection we strive, the legends alive\n\n[Murs]\nHuh, Murs, yo\nNow when I first started out, they said I wouldn't make it\nI'm made of less metal, probably just couldn't take it\nI roll with my aces, certified assassins\nMid-city militia, we come through smashing\nWe fucking with them butterknives, we swinging them katanas\nSharper than piranhas, cutting through your body armor\nIt's all about honor, man, respect the code\nTouch a point on your neck and make your chest explode\nAnd the water turns vets into vegetables\nYou gotta, stay on point or be the next to go\nWhether, dickies or chucks, or the guess and low\nIt's all one love, homie, rep your coast\nCause fame is elusive, respect is the prize\nIs he less of a man, you can check through his eyes\nThose guys with subversive plots\nBe the ones you despise, and the first to watch, hah\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/32fabf2b8b2eb256a0e1d6a14a76852f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
