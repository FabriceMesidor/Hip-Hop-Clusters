I made that bitch famous\nNot really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)\nAll I do is get tattoos and read French Vague\nEvery bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nWho am I to remind you? (What?)\nBut tell me, who am I to remind you? (Who am I?)\nAnd did you know that the country, Switzerland\nIt was famous for lakes?\nAnd I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates\nNigga, icy like hockey\nCold like a dead body, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Nina Simone + Young Thug]\nI just wanted you to know\nI've loved you better than your own kin did\nFrom the very start (Oh yeah)\nI don't blame you much for wanting to be free\nI just wanted you to know\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West + Young Thug]\nNike slave, fit in your place\nDon't come out your face\nDon't come out your mouth\nDon't come out your house\nDon't come out the blah\nIt came out the North, it came out the South\nThe tally is down\nBumpin' the...\nThe hate is anony...\nThe Copacabana...\nIt made me...\nSomeone told me...\nThe world turnin' Black slowly\nWhere you can call niggas \"niggas\"\nBut you better not mention Hitler\nSo tell me who run the label, where the guns from?
