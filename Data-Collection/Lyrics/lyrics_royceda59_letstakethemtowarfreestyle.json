(how can I lose?)\nBut I've been had moves (I got the moves)\n\n[Verse]\nI got I Decided on pre order, my lil homie just went gold\nI hock a loogie on a reporter, Detroit is on Pete Rose\nThat's Armstrong on steroids, gated up no wing toes\nMy phones blowing up so much a nigga may end up like Cee-Lo\nI bounce back like the fattest ass you can have attached to the fattest hips and anything after this shall be considered cataclysmic\nCountin' packs like a statisician\nEmphatic charisma\nSavage enigma\nI have a religion to handle your rhythm like cannibalism\nThe camera rollin' and it's time to flow\nI don't know\nI just go carnival\nI'm from Motown you know\nI can just line up the hollow tips inside the clip\nAnd I can just go down the road\nAnd knock 'em down like some dominoes\nAfter you already out then I'm dropping some more like you 2Pac and the commandos\nWatching my comments like papparazi watching Sasha Obama grow\nI got Elijah Mohammed glow\nI got the dough these rappers claim they got at the house in my drawer in the envelope\nMy focus phenomenal\nMy temperature so hot and cold I broke the thermometer\nGuarantee I will kill the flow\nThis remind me of LaLa Anthony ass in that New Edition movie\nNiggas tryin' to cover it up and make her look old\nGuarantee I'mma still steal the show\nI been had the moves\nI remember these bitches was just a dream\nActresses and models I used to only see on television\nNow they be climbin' out of my television lookin' at me to get the ring\nI remember all I used to be around is dudes that used to try to just kill by me\nChoppin' and conceal bodies\nUsed to clean up the bloody mess up in front of me\nI had to holla at a tube\nI had to still deal with that field sobriety\nHad to do a double take at the dirty mop when he was finished\nLooked like Lil Yachty\nNigga, I went to jail for the whole year\nI got out and I did the same thing you wack ass rappers do when y'all got your little show here\nI came right out to booze/boo's\nStraight right out the news\nRight off the cover of a magazine\nHad the magazine with me at the club showing people like \"Look at this and please try not to drool\"\nI fuck a Stacy thick ass for all the days she used to make me work\nAnd Tracy slick ass but not before I fuck April first\nTranslation I'm bout to fool\nY'all countin' me out well I got you\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, here I count for you\nBiiitch\n\n[Hook]\nLast time took an 'L', now it's time to bounce back\n(I been had the moves)\nI was broke as hell, now it's time to bounce back\n(I got the moves)\nEvery time I fail I got up and bounced back\n(I been had the moves)\nAnd nothing y'all can tell me about that bounce back\n[Repeat]\n\n[Part 2: \"No Hook\" Remix]\n\n[Intro]\nI\u2019m doing this cause this what God want me to do\nThese lyrics is ordained by the Lord\nYou gon' get these bars\nFor free\n\n[Verse]\nIt\u2019s bad half and finally famous\nThe weapon\u2019s Iranian\nY\u2019all niggas is Pomeranian\nMy damie y\u2019all Pootie Tang\nNigga I\u2019m Damien\nShots drop from out of my cranium\nMy mind is Lebron drainin\u2019 em\nFive finger ring titanium\nAlready in your top 5\nNow my dingaling now dangling\nI\u2019m flyer than Tom Chambers on the first NBA Live\nDouble pumping from the three point NBA line\nOn that war page with that 24 gauge\nBut when I double pump it I\u2019m prime Chamberlain\nEvery track on the record got a background message\n\u201cWe don\u2019t back down ever!\u201d\nI\u2019m putting the autobiographical book out with the Book of Ryan\nI just let my bitch in LA read, now that sounds epic\nMy mind carries words\nYou couldn\u2019t walk a mile in my patent leather Larry Bird black con weapons\nI hope you know theres more fish that\u2019s in the sea\nI stole ya ho, we been kissing like we been sitting in a tree\nAnd these ho\u2019s in Detroit be trickin\u2019 sooo much\nThey can completely gooo up a magician\u2019s sleeve\nYou\u2019re totally awesome\nWhile I pour 40\u2019s on corners for those we lost\nMy soul suffers from holy exhaustion\nTrippin\u2019 on opium just to cope with openin\u2019 coffins\nThe devil sittin\u2019 close enough to me to quote me an offer\nKeep the union in unison like the Soviet\u2019s marching\nWe goin\u2019 iron for iron like a trophy in golfing\nMy nigga, better yet, I feel like the only man who can understand me is Sloth from The Goonies\nCause he retarded as fuck, on a boat with a treasure chest\nThat makes perfectly good sense\nThat\u2019s exactly how my career went\nLike a fuckin\u2019 experiment\nI got a lot on my mind that I gotta deal with\nFirst of all, my favorite uncle died and favorite auntie died\nI missed both of they funerals fuckin\u2019 around with rappers\nSo every day and every night my conscience cries\nI\u2019m stressed out because my moms be tired, pops be workin\u2019\nAnd Lord knows I done threw enough dollars on the floor in the past for moms to retire\nThat\u2019s why I be in the lab and my mind be wired\nTrying to figure it out fast before my time expires\nMan, but it\u2019s this one thing that always on my fucking mind and it haunts me constantly guys\nAnd that\u2019s why in the fuck have I not at least tried to get in between Ashanti\u2019s thighs\nI\u2019m feeling like a straight sucker I faced the vibration\nMy sober, righteous life only got a place for my lady\nBut maybe I can ask my lady for permission\nShe can give me a hall pass like Jason Sudeikis\nThis audio porn I\u2019m giving with a bit of sense\nA mind fuck if you will\nI\u2019m from Detroit but if I send you to the store with a large bill for some little shit\nBitch, I was born by a river in a little tent\nNow I just ride with six vehicles with an ill tint\nI\u2019m cut from the kind of cloth that\u2019ll never go outta style\nWith or without the internet my shit\u2019ll still trend\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m still standing with everything I came with\nCool as a Jacuzzi everything in me is built in\nNah, I don\u2019t borrow I\u2019d rather discuss loaning\nI\u2019m ready to go to war with whoever the fuck want it\nY\u2019all weigh your respect against your release date\nI\u2019m just an artist dog I don\u2019t know how to be fake\nI don\u2019t want no problems dog\nI don\u2019t wanna be apart of nothing with lies involved\nI don\u2019t want no phone that receives a thousand calls\nI don\u2019t need to be around a thousand smiling broads\nWith they hands out\nProbably couldn\u2019t survive without em all\nBut they can\u2019t vouch for who the next sucker", "image": "https://images.genius.com/926da4b9db57a13888d962c131c88ed2.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
