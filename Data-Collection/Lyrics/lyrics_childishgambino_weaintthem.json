East Side to the gravestone!\nBrown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy\nNigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy, uh\nHold up, hold up, we can do better\nPut my voice on the track, man, that shit is much wetter\nAt the studio at 8 AM\nHit the booth then eat, nigga, we ain't them, nigga, we ain't them!\nDrop a line, it's your Facebook status\nSaid that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us\nIf there's something on your chest, nigga, let it out\n'Cause I'm the best, da-da-da", "image": "https://images.genius.com/587833871590a682c8aed1b739f0cb23.906x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
