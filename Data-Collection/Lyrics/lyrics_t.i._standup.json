of shit to motherfuckin' say, yeah\nBut when a nigga bring it to them niggas\nThey can't stand up for what they motherfuckin' said\nNaw, I ain't say that, he said that\nStand up if you got somethin' to say, my nigga\nStand up for what you said, my nigga\nTell them niggas bring it to the square, nigga\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nYou got a alligator mouth and a hummingbird ass\nYour mouth writing checks that your ass can't cash\n145 and I'm out of your weight class\nWant to survive, you better scramble like eggs and break fast\nCause I know how to handle your fake ass\nI'm a ride on you and hide you in yesterday's trash\nPull up in the Chevy's spraying rounds through the glass\nSee you laying face down in the grass and I'll laugh\nHa, cause that's the end of the saga\nThe end of my problems, nigga mash the Impala\nGo lay up with a model and watch the news tomorrow\nAnd that's the end checkmate, game over, I'll holler\nPimp, telling you partner, you don't know what you're doing\nOr recognize the trouble you getting in to and you're ruin\nAnd dig this man\nI spent my childhood in a wild hood\nAnd all that gangster shit you talking, yeah, it sound good\nBut make it understood\nYou gone have to show me, I'm a O.G\nYou want to overthrow me\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]\nDearly beloved, we're gathered here today\nTo marry this young nigga in his own special thug way\nDo you promise to love and respect all of the real niggas\nAnd when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em\nDo you swear to turn this chopper\nOn any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya\nOr do you promise to keep him handy\nAnd don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family\nAnd keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body\nUnless somebody, who want him in his body\nTo love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel\nFrom the bottom of your heart\n'til death do you fuckin' part\nDo you understand to live, to lie by him\nIs to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him\nI know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid\nShit, all them motherfuckers dead\nAnd did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West\nEnd up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest\nCause they ain\u2019t never seen a Carbine, a Mini 14, or a Tommy Gun\nWith a hundred round fuckin' drum\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]\nShit, I'm talking about riding out tonight\nOnly way I die first, got to kill me in this verse\nWeezy F middle finger to life\nSo nothing seem critical in the hood I'm typical\nYet I'm feeling good and spiritual\nHealing hoods with this shit up out my kitchen\nI'm pitching that it's really good\nSmoking, drinking, I'm like a fish\nAnd I'll probably shit on ya bitch\nProbably piss on her lips and she probably give you a kiss\nNasty, Holly Grove classic\nPolly wood a nigga probably robbed the same bastard\nAsk him\nWe don't give a fuck about a casket\nNigga this the murder campy\nNiggas is murder happy\n12 years old, I jumped off the pot\nI started selling rock right after I got shot\nI had to hold my weight down\nPussy nigga stand up or lay down\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]\nStand up\nIf you don't like what I'm saying then buck\nSwing when you see me we can throw them hands sucker\nStand up\nIf you didn't notice nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIf I said it then I meant it and what fuck nigga\nStand up\nYou don't want to see the triggerman bust\nHit you and your mans up, make it hard for niggas to\nStand up\nTell your crew they don't want it with us dude\nAnd if them motherfuckers do, bust a motherfucking move\nStand up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/639bf5b825c66e0f59d87574014bc4cf.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
