Beware, it's the re-animator\nA menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon\nAn assassinator, if the people ain't stepping\nYou see a part of me that you never seen\nWhen I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend\nAfter 12, I'm worse than a Gremlin\nFeed me hip-hop and I start trembling\nThe thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified\nBut this ain't the cinemas or Tales from the Darkside\nBy any means necessary, this is what has to be done\nMake way 'cause here I come\nMy DJ cuts material\nGrand imperial\nIt's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me\nIt's inherited, it runs in the family\nI wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back\nIf that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack\nNow I don't want to have to let off, you should have kept off\nYou didn't keep the stage warm, step off\nLadies and gentleman, you're about to see\nA pastime, hobby about to be\nTaken to the maximum, I can't relax see\nI'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one\nHell of an antidote, something you can't smoke, more than dope\nYou're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke\nMore than cracked up, you should have backed up\nFor those that act up need to be more than smacked up\nAny entertainer, I got a torture chamber\nOne on one and I'm the remainder\nSo close your eyes and hold your breath\nAnd I'mma hit ya with the blow of death\nBefore you go, you'll remember ya seen\nThe fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend\nThe microphone fiend", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c5bb3dd65ede40b0025482c7a725c64.599x579x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
