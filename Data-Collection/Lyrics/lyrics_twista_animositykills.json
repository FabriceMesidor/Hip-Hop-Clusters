I don't know but animosity kills\n\n[Hook]\nOn stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nAnd Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)\nBefore the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nSpeedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nIt's your funeral, so order some flowers from the florist\nI'm turning the hardest chumps into bigger gumps than Forrest\nYou can't ignore this, vocals get omnivorous, catch rigor mortis\nThe trigger for this is the chorus, my guns are cordless, oris\nMy strategy's agony, make a scar that'll be tragedy\nThe majesty leaves niggas dead as car batteries, them raggedy\nRappers get ripped when the mic marauder chokes\nThinkin' tomorrow's hope, but death is in your horoscope\nWhen my horror scopes, pages travel space ages, stages\nI work 'em wise, when hype is on microphones I circumcise\nThen hurt them thighs over bitches physical composition\nCompetition gets dismissed if listed as opposition\nMy mission's position is dissing\nTake a hit of this, rather hit or miss\nI still could split a wrist like a clitoris 'cause I injure this\nI beat just to make agony bleed out\nAnd me lose I doubt it, so if I'm in your path nigga reroute it\nHow'd it happen to my crew is what's said when I scare a staff\nI tear in half motherfuckas with every paragraph\nSit there and laugh, 'cause you can't bear the wrath\nAs tragedy builds animosity and agony kills\n\n[Hook]\nOn stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nAnd Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)\nBefore the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nSpeedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nI slay rappers of simplicity, it ain't shit to me\nGet with me, I take the victory, you must not know my history\nSniff the scent of the magnificent, I done killed niggas in battles\nThen when they come back with seconds I'm on some different shit\nMy prototype shows that I explode like Dolemite when I hold the mic\nNiggas that test might as well throw the fight, my flow's that strike\nRange from passionate to blasting it with yo ass in it\nOn the stage is where I let your casket sit, fast as shit\nComing through like a prowler, punks I devour\nTesting me is worse than hiding from Norman Bates in the shower\nHorror y'all, causing a fucking bloody waterfall\nOnly way I see competition is if you brought a ball\nI slaughter all, pull your crew members just on a call\nPlus admission but if you keep dissing we just gotta brawl\nSo what's the call?\nIf you let animosity build, tragedy will\nAnd through defeat is when agony kills\n\n[Hook]\nOn stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nAnd Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)\nBefore the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)\nSpeedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging\n(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de56185a5feae8fc7307820980156a11.200x200x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
