I thought I had it figured out\nSee I panic and I pout\nYo I've had it man, I'm out\nGod damn it, this shit's a clout\nI'm the baddest, ain't no doubt\nBut my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout\n\n[Hook]\nHow come the world is always quick to turn they back on me\nWon't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep\nI'll be in your dream\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dream\nMaybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man\nI'll be in your dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice\nI've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life\nUnhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why\nI'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by\nI knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts\nA bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park\nA bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard\nThe same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart\nShe cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles\nHanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock yo\nThe biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado\nFuck a hoe, that\u2019s Hopsin\u2019s motto, my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow\nShe met another guy who left the baby stuck inside\nHer vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life\nNow she hits me up and I\nSay go suck a nut, goodbye\nAll you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo live a decent life what all does it take\nI tried and tried to be the best but nothing falls in the place\nAnd I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break\nAnd just evolve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state\nAnd shit it probably is fake but who's in control of it me or god\nIs he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd\nI'm broke and need a job, for spending cheese on broads\nBut y'all don't see the flaws I coat it up to keep it raw\nAnd mc's who's got the most talent in this whole planet\nDon't never get recognized when they dope at it\nSo they go back to the block hustlin' and dope addicts\nSome niggas got the 'it factor' some niggas don't have it\nYo I'm at my last tears cuz everytime I think I'm out the matrix\nI get sucked right back in\nBut man I'm hopin' things are change and the soul in me remains\nCuz the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained\n\n[Bridge] (x2)\nNo, no\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\nNo, no\nI don't even have a purpose\n\n[Collision]\nPillow man (x4)\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
