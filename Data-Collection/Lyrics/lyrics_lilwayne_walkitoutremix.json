Nigga, Tha Carter out\nThis is what I call a Drought \u2014 3\nAnd we don't walk it out, we drop-top Porsche it out\nThey better walk 'em out, before we chalk 'em out\nWe chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out\nWe chalk it out, we chalk it out, we chalk it out\nWe chalk 'em now\nThey don't want it, uh-uh; no, they don't want it, uh-uh\nYou see, they phony, I'm not; oh yeah, they phony, I'm not\nI Eastside walk it out, I bring New Orleans out\nI am a Saints fan, oh yeah we marchin' now\nLike we're a Saints band, I play the organs now\nAnd if they talking, most likely I'm what they talking 'bout\nMy nigga T from the East roll up that forest now\nMan, I'm just trying to get my Peanuts, I'm like Charlie Brown\nOK, that Uzi make a Harley sound\nTake two of these and walk around\nCome straight from that homeless town\nThis game belong to Carter now, bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82588434bc5c5032b1e49dee6403c736.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
