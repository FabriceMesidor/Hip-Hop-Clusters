{"songs": [{"title": "Letter To Detroit", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Detroit\n\nThere is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets\nYou can't define it, but you can feel it\nYou can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home\nFrom people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'\nYou took our country from it's infancy, into industry\nAnd your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat\nYou became the city that carried the country\nThe city, like the sport, is built on dreams\nPeople who would drive to you, driven to excel\nWho know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice\nWhen you hurt, we hurt\nYour streets witness our struggle\nYour bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed\nWe've lived through the ups and the downs\nBut we remain, Detroit\nWe can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you\nMy home\nThe home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis\nThrough all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated\nYou've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us\nSometimes down, but never out\nTake strength in us, your people\n\nStay up Detroit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
