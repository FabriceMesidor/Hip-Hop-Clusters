Here's a piece of mine\nAll I need's a line\nBut sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme\nTo express how I'm really feeling at that time\nYeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes\nIt's just sometimes, it's always me\nHow dark can these hallways be?\nThe clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three\nThis half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper\n[rip] I'm desperate at my desk\nIf I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again\nStuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'\nFuck, I'm stumped up, wait, here comes somethin'\n[crumples paper] Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out\nNew pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out\nI'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out\nBall's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out\nI'm afraid, but why am I afraid?\nWhy am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave\nReal enough to rile you up\nWant me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want\nI'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter\nI'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a\nFucking boiling point, put some oil in your joints\nFlip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed\nAn MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense\nThey hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence\nBy the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'\nBy the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawing someone\nBy the way they're running, you would swear the law was comin'\nIt's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'\nMomma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back\nHe pinky promised, I don't think he's honest\nI'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock\nFuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch\nDon't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race\nAnd I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch\nI found my niche, you gon' hear my voice\n'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice\nIf I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung\nIf I have half a chance I grab it \u2014 Rabbit, run!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8dd03ebbf724e2b4d4bafbddf8c3c2f1.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
