I could teach you how to turn her out\nShow you how to buy 'em low and sell 'em high\nBut don't assume that it's all that I know about\nA made me, a D and D, that's while I raise kid\nI got married and fucked it up, that what fame did\nMarriage counselor tell me focus on what the pain did\nTo busy focusin', tryna do what Jay and Dame did\nI'm on a path; I got a purpose, to reach a destination\nAnd either you helpin' me get to it or you in the way\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nHope they wasn't lyin' when they said it all comes back around, baby\nStuck up here, tryin' to let you go but it's such a long way down\nBut if it's still a Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, well I'm still breathin'\nIf there's something I can say before you finish leavin'\nAnd if everything still happens for a reason, maybe you come back around just like the seasons\nLike the seasons\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI'm so extreme, never been a man of moderation\nSee, subtlety just ain't my cup of tea\nDon't want my grass green, I want the lobby decorated\nAnd last thing I need somebody sayin' I never make it\nDon't give a damn, you can catch me with whoever naked\nStill some forms of disrespect, I ain't gon' never take it\nEven with my vocabulary, can't explain it\nI'm sorry what you thought I was, I just ain't there\nGet it why you say I ain't shit, big will keep rollin' though\nHoldin' up the block, doin' such and such with so and so\nQue sera, sera\nCure it with a hundred million party like it's Marti Gras\nGot some bad Latino wit' me, they some laddi daddi das\nSee, you said they be hatin', I say send 'em my regards\nBury it under T and A, I call that R&R\nTryna get some stripes on me, that's how you start a war\nI been practicin' my reaction to niggas come with stupid shit\nFuck out my face, man, the conversation over with\nI'm done talkin'\nHow was that-was that good, for real?\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nHope they wasn't lyin' when they said it all comes back around, baby\nStuck up here and tryin' to let you go but it's such a long way down\nBut if it's still a Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, well I'm still breathin'\nIf there's something I can say before you finish leavin'\nAnd if everything still happens for a reason, maybe you come back around just like the seasons\nLike the seasons\n\n[Outro: Dave Chappelle & T.I.]\nI'm not promisin' to be perfect but I'll try my best to be great\nThis ain't no game, this a mother fuckin' trap\nThis ain't no game, this a mother fuckin' trap", "image": "https://images.genius.com/762209f629de50995145f116f95b5ea9.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
