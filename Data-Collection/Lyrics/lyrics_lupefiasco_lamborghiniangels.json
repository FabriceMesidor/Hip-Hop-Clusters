Kennedy]\nMy fellow Americans...\n\n[Hook]\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28b8a5ecdbbff378fa74ebd0c123e54f.316x316x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
