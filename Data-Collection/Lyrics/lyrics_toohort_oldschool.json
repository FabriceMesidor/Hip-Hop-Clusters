I'm from the old school\n\nI came in the door as the story goes\nLooked around the room all I seen was hoes\nIt's like a pussy supermarket; let's go shoppin\nPacked like sardines, clubs straight poppin\nFuck the V.I.P. section\nI'm bout to hit the pharmacy, and get my head connected\nGet me some protection\nWalk around and see who I wanna have sex with\nThe usual - a nice high-yellow cutie\nOr maybe tonight, I might find a black beauty\nWith a big ol' booty, no doubt\nWe'll have a few drinks and then roll out\nI can't do the \"Jungle Fever\"\nCause it's too many black hoes here that might see ya\nIf I peep a white broad with some ass and lips\nFine as hell - I'mma have to ask the bitch some'in\nCause I might end up fuckin\nI don't care what you say, I don't owe you hoes nothin\nI fuck tall bitches, even fuck small bitches\nToo bad I can't fuck all you bitches\nIt don't take players like me too long\nTo get bitches like you to let me take you home\nI got the game from Oakland, California\nI'm Short Dawg, I hope your momma warned ya\nBout the old school.. do the old school\nI'm from the old school.. do the old school\n\nI'm always hustlin, always workin hard\nIf you tryin to get the money I'mma do my part\nOn the weekends, we like to celebrate\nCash checks ride away can't wait\nFuck crime - I'm bustin Too $hort rhymes\nUnless it's bout millions I ain't tryin to do time\nIt's like everyday is Saturday\nSo many bitches let me have my way\nYou can analyze it, all you want\nBut I was knockin bad hoes with no teeth in the front\nWhen I had no money and drove my momma's car\nI had bad-ass bitches look like superstars\nIt's the game, old as it may be\nIt makes fine-ass hoes call me baby\nI look down and think, this that fuckin shit\nSeein this beautiful bitch, she just suckin my dick\nToo many times in a player's wife\nWe always have to hear what you squares feel like\nFuck that; do what you gotta do\nI see you creepin through the hood buyin prostitutes\nI know I'm fuckin hoes, and gettin high\nYou wanna criticize me but you livin a lie\nWith yo' suit and tie, and yo' love for hoes\nYou ain't shit motherfucker and Short Dawg knows\nI'm from the old school.. do the old school\nDo the old school.. I'm from the old school\n\nDon't cross the game they'll take yo' life\nRespect the game and you can play all night\nIf you snitchin, don't get caught slippin\nIf you blood'n or crip'n, other niggas set-trippin\nWatch yo' back, it don't take a brainiac\nWe got a lot of homocidal maniacs in the streets\nSometimes life is terrible\nY'all say goodbye, niggas say be careful\nBack in the day they woulda killed yo' ass\nFor a reason, they might even keep you breathin\nFuck your whole world up, you can't get down\nBroke livin on the streets and you can't skip town\nBut ain't no slow deaths in the triple-oh\nIf you fuckin up then you get to go\nSomebody gon' hold you down\nSo you can't get up off that cold ground\nLights flashin, and you keep passin out\nYou know you fucked up with your bad-ass mouth\nOnce upon a time they woulda knocked you out\nMaybe back in ninety-nine, but not in 2000\nAnybody wanna do it like the old school?\nHella niggas at the park with no shootin\nSunday afternoon, at the park\nNiggas leanin hella hard goin by in the car\nDo the old school.. do the old school\nI'm from the old school.. do the old school\nOld school.. do the old school\nI'm from the old school..\nYeah old school baby, BEOTCH!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/96065abbdb6b1c6563ccc77d191b621b.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
