What up, Slum Ville?\nI hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still\nThe fans thinking that we all signed for one mil\nEqual opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal\nThat ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes\nAnd I been getting high just to balance out the lows\nAnd I could use a writer just to balance out my flows\nBut I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows\nAnd every time I try, it opens up my eyes\nThese verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised\nAnd I would be performing this as long as I'm alive\nSo every word I utter will be mine\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)\nI never cried when Pac died\nBut I probably will when Hov does\nAnd if my tears hold value then I would drop one\nFor every single thing he showed us\nAnd I'll be standing in a puddle\nI stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble\nAnd I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle\nIt's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle\nStaring at the members of my team\nWho get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme\nJust know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams\nI hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems\nBut y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion\nYou know I spend money because spending time is hopeless\nAnd know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions\nAt least I put it all in the open\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here\nPremature millionaires, welcome to my realest year\nYeah, I swear that we making a killing here\nI should be on top of the world just chilling here\nBut it's funny having fans\nWho find you before anybody ever has the chance\nAnd build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game\nAnd realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same\nYeah, and plus things are just surreal at home\nPeople think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown\nAnd now security follow me everywhere\nSo I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone\nI think I'm scared of what the future holds\nI was wishing for some things and now am used to those\nEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes\nThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed\nAll my old friends think I got a new crowd\nAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile\nI guess that mean they come few and far between\nEven though I'm living out what you would call the dream\nAnd my uncle ain't even messaging me\nAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me\nI hope this isn't one of those forever things\nIt's funny how money can change everything\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3bfca8cc309a53212af939a039f3fdb1.539x539x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
