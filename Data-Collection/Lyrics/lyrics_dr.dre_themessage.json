I'm only half the man that I was\nI'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you\nYou knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect\nYou coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him\nHe can take the game with him, cause he defines the word\nThe one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?\nI'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why\nCrying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it\nWe fought like brothers, something we never should do\nWe coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth\nHe had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow\nDon't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go\n\n[Hook: Mary J. Blige]\nListen, listen, listen (Listen)\nListen, listen, listen (Better listen)\nListen, listen, listen\nListen\n\n[Post-Hook: Rell & Mary J. Blige]\nIf you wan' know why (Why I live my life)\nThe way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)\nSo don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)\nI'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nYou's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there\nMet up with homies from the street, and got deep up there\nIf you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew\nI thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you\nWe lost a thug, a son, and a father\nI spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him\nThe Lord must be accidentally pulling your file\nCause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial\nPrayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt\nYou either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it\nI done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face\nTo straight breaking down and showing all emotions\nI'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry\nIf that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta\nIt's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you\nI miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you\n\n[Hook: Mary J. Blige]\n[Listen, listen, listen (Listen)\nListen, listen, listen (Better listen)\nListen, listen, listen\nListen](7469635)\n\n[Post-Hook: Rell & Mary J. Blige]\nIf you wan' know why (Why I live my life)\nThe way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)\nSo don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)\nI'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper\n\n[Outro: Mary J. Blige]\nListen\nIf you don't know why I you gotta listen up right now\nListen, listen, listen, listen\nListen, listen\nListen, listen, children, listen\nI'm tryin to tell you somethin' good\nDon't get caught up in the hood, yeah\nIf you don't know why\nYou gotta find out the reason why\nBrother, brother\n\n[Skit]\nOh, you're Doctor Dre. Ha-ha, are you a real doctor dude? I mean like, you know, can you prescribe some drugs for me man? Come on dude, I'll split whatever I get with ya, okay?
