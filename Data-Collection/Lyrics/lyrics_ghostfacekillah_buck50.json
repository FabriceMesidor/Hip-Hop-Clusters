We ain't got shit, something got to give\nY'all done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the crib\nDie and live for my nigs and my bad-ass kids, freeze\nLooking at your ice like \"Jeez!\"\nI'm plotting on the mousetrap, about to snatch the cheese\nI heard y'all kids is bout that, psychotherapy\nYou bugging where the couch at, Wu til they bury me\nNever tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree\nNow it's cherry pie, if it's not broke let it be\nAin't nothing nice in New York\nStick you for your cake and your icing, that tough talk\nDon't mean nothing when you're up North\nSo keep them hands where I can see 'em like you want freedom\nYou know that saying: \"If you can't join 'em, beat 'em\nAnd push your way in\"\nWe ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion\nPick the pace up, pants sagging pull your waist up\nNiggas renting slum jewels from Jacob, fool!\nYou're like \"Dude! I don't like your fucking attitude\"\nFronting on my Clan from the Stat but we ain't mad at you\n\n[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]\nYo, yo! Starks with the Parcheesi face, measly paced, old face\nGhostface! Jump out the window for a little taste\nThe joopy look, my main bitches call me lazy\nEducated birds say, \"Ghost you so crazy!\"\n\n[Verse 2: Cappadonna]\nCappa slide through with the Ghost\nPost up like paint on walls, drip jew-els, big heat\nRuffle inside the bubble goose, it's the Odd Couple\nHollow points follow you home to Staten Island\nPlaying with the big toys that make noise\nEcho in the hall, a scared voice\nNiggas start to act choice, but Duncan Hines\nDidn't know Betty Crocker had the two nines\nMade the club moist, shattered the windows\nDustheads running\nThe rap kingpin plus the Black Jesus is coming\n\n[Verse 3: Redman]\nThe words you talk better be the words you walk\nBody you in the bed where the nurses are\nPut your vein out, watch me insert the dart\nTil it plagues from Bricks to the Persian Gulf\nLight circuits off, thirty-third of my brain is off\nThat explains why my language off\nMy gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl\nY'all more like in training bras\nWet behind the ear, you're not prepared\nFor the project flow, with extra stairs\nI pass out a vest to wear (bullets flyin)\nYo, the hard wire, starting bonfires\nPull the mask so you know it's me\nAnd your weed got more seeds than ODB\nCan't smoke with ya, watch Ghost tie a rope to ya\nDef and Wu will open ya\n\n[Chorus: Method Man & (Redman)]\nEat a dick like (HUH!)\nBaby shake your shit, girl you're thick like (HUH!)\nGetting rich like (HUH!)\n\n[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]\nWord, it's me y'all\nWe in two sixes flirting with bitches, dime plus\nTaking pictures, How you doing baby? My name Ghost\nDon't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak\nSeek intelligence, slickest nigga going since \"Grease\"\nCheck out the grays on the side of my waves\nI grew those on Rikers Island\nStressed out, balled up in the cage\nPull a boot out on Jimmy Jam, text takes jam\nSilky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler\nAll up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come\nBiggie's Versaces, snow white rabbit\nHands is like photographic magic\nFuneral love, move in when we hug, don't make it a habit\nHit the gym for two weeks, my back all chiseled\nElbows unique now meet the new me\nGhetto fabulous, Tone Atlas\nZulu Nation in the 80's in front of Macy's I start my own chapters\nTyco Nite-Glow velvet pose, special effects\nHigh-tech armors merc you at the shows\nSuper-cali-fragi-listic-expi-ali-docious\nDocious-ali-expi-fragi-listic-cali-super\nCanc\u00fan, catch me in the room, eating grouper\n\n[Chorus: Method Man & (Redman)]\nShoe fly shoe, Wally Don Clark crew\nFuck y'all wanna do, crack a brew\nSmoke an L or two and flip like (HUH!)\nKilling for the whole clique is sick like (HUH!)\nYou and your stank bitch eat a dick like (HUH!)\nBaby shake your shit, girl you're thick like (HUH!)\nGetting rich like (HUH!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0013dbd91dff7fd77352a0283ad6ec5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
