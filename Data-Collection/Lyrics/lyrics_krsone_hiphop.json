When\nComin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin\nOh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin\nIt's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin\nI can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin\nAnd the black church ain't sayin nuttin\nWe on our own cousin, I'm stickin to this\n\n[Hook]\n\n[KRS-One]\nI'm livin for this hip-hop, I'm spittin for this hip-hop\nI'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop\nCulture, and y'all know that\nHip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack\nBut just like them dopefiends who keep comin back\nLike the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack\nNo disrespect to either one of them but look at that\nStudy the metaphors in this rap\nWe bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it\nWe bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it\nJustice, equality, keep cryin it\nBut the only way to get it is to start applyin it\nFat Joe that's my bro shows 'nuff respect\nTalib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect\n50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect\nCommon!
