Talking that shit that you be talking\nAnd I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walking\nBut shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt\nNiggas is wondering, how the fuck you hid your skirt?\nRight under they eyes, imagine surprise to the guys\nThat one of they mans was a bitch in disguise\nI'm fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids\nLet me holla at you yo the Baltimore shit\nNah mean? I'm just robbin to eat\nAnd there's at least a thousand of me like me mobbin' the street\nWhen we starvin' we eat whatever's there\nCome on, you know the code in the streets, whatever's fair\nBlood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk\nAfter the talk, about him not bein' on 1130B to New York\nAnd transforming ass niggas will get it quick\nAnd yo, for real, that nigga 2Pac can suck my dick\nAnd it's gonna take all them niggas in the West Coast\nTo barely move me, 'cause when I blow shit up\nI have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie\nAhhh! You know I don't know how to act\nI get too close to niggas, it's like:\n\"Protected by Viper, stand back\"\nWhat's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented\nFuck ya'll want me to do wit this coward? \"Finish him!\" It's ended\n\n[Outro]\nEast heard the west is, craving for a nightmare\nAight???\nCraving for a nightmare", "image": "https://images.genius.com/11624e2636cfbcb8056392a59b00e708.600x927x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
