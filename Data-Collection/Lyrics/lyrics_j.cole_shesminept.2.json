Where's your diaper shit here?\nLay on your back, don't pee right now\nOr else I'll have to get you back\nOne day when you gon' want to get your way\nYeah I'll have fun with that\nReminisce when you came out the womb\nTears of joy I think filled up the room\nYou are now the reason that I fight\nI ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life\nGot me thinking...\n\n[Bridge]\nAm I worthy of this gift?\nAm I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)\nInto a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)\nSomeone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)\nAm I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)\nAm I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)\nInto a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)\nSomeone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIb gon' ask me how I did this shit\nI'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit\nThats the ego taking credit for what God made\nFuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made\n(She's mine) Catch me, don't you\n(She's mine) Catch me, don't you\n(She's mine) Catch me\nI've fallen in love for the first time\nI wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it\nDon't wanna die, 'cause now you're here\nAnd I just wanna be right by your side\nOn any night that you be cryin', baby\nI dry your eyes, I dry your eyes\n\n[Outro]\nThere is a God, it is a God\nYeah, it is a God\nI never felt so alive\nI never felt so alive\nI never felt so alive\n(I never felt so alive)\nI never felt so alive\n(I never felt so alive)\nCatch me, don't you\u2014\nCatch me, don't you\u2014\nCatch me, I've fallen in love for the first time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8867c7f0c8a290e03aaa2fbc804fdbf.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
