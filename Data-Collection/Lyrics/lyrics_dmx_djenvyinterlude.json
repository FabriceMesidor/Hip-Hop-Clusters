(uh-huh) when he was shooting a movie\nAnd uh, we did about four or five tracks\nBut the reason I knew DMX was so big\nIs in the middle of the movie he stopped filming\nAnd was like \"Envy, let's go, uhh, fly helicopters.\" (ha ha ha)\nAnd we went to the store, we bought remote control helicopters\nAnd started flying helicopters in the middle of the set!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a83aa2064f0cf2f07b1c8f34f2c70406.240x240x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
