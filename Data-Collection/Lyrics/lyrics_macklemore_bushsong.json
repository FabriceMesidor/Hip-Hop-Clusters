Probably off in Iraq\nFinding some oil to tap, tell 'em I got up on that\nAnd y'all still think it was Bin Laden\nWhen it was us and the Masons, plotting on oil profits\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm evil\nBut y'all didn't know though\nNow y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'\nUnemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch\nOur country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich\nI'm evil\nBut y'all didn't know though\nNow y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'\nUnemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch\nOur country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy brother said some racist shit a couple of years back\nThen the blacks came out and started to protest and crap\nAnd I knew I'd have little hope, cause all of sudden\nThe blacks got together and started to register to vote\nBut thank God for computers and them helping\nCause we got the last names of every single felon\nWe programmed the computers to find the names that were the same\nWhoever came up couldn't vote on election day\nWay to go Jeb, really great strategy\nWe got rid of the majority of black families\nAnd I'm not even talking about Dade County\nThe expired military ballots are bogus, counted\nI'd like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy\nMy cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy\nHe told the entire world that I won\nBefore the votes were being done counted\nAnd even though Gore had more, what matters in the end\nIs the Supreme Court, and those are my dad's friends\nSo thank you very much, and please remember\nIf you don't vote, I'll see you back in November\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm evil\nBut y'all didn't know though\nNow y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'\nUnemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch\nOur country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich\nI'm evil\nBut y'all didn't know though\nNow y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'\nUnemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch\nOur country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
