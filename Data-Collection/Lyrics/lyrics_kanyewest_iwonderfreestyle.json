Because I rap from the heart\nWhat I always did from the start\nHow I always played my part\nUh, they thought I was so crazy, I got a deal with Jay Z\nNow they got to pay me and they looked up lately\nI sold a million the first week\n'Member when I just sold my first beat\nShit can change and it never stayed the same\nMa, I wonder, I wonder what it would be now\nWhat it would be now, you all standin' in the crowd\nTen thousand, now they hate everythin' now\nEverythin' now\nOr every single I dropped now, I dropped now\nTryin' do everythin' to keep shit hot now\nAnd the media, they diss me, diss me\nThey say I'm so fuckin' evil\nAyo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, what the fuck do he know?\nCause I'm gonna say my, my shit\nAnd I'm gonna talk my, my shit\nAnd they can suck my, my, my, my\nI wonder why they talk so bad\nHave they ever had a artist that's so mad?\nAnd they will never realize what they have\nSomebody real in the industry\nIf nobody's real, then I guess it's me\nAnd they, \"Freedom,\" and it's not free\nCause every time I talk freely they attack me\nThey give me backlash, backlash, backlash\nBlack, but they can kiss my ass, my ass, my ass, my ass\nI say, \"Why ask? Why ask? Why?\"\nTry but try, can they's fly?\nNow touch the sky, touch the sky, touch the sky\nAnd I wonder, baby, to can know what it means\nWhat we know\nAnd I wonder, baby, if you know what it means", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
