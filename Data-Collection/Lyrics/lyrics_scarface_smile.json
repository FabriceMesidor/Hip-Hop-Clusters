Yeah\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nOur lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions\nPictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'\nNo fairy tales for this young black male\nSome see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales\nHustlers hardly think of culture\nOr the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures\nSellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches\nWishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures\nWhy shed tears? Save your sympathy\nMy childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary\nHere's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe\nIf you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!\nAgainst all odds, though life is hard we carry on\nLivin' in the projects, broke with no lights on\nTo all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence\nBorn with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!\n\n[Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)]\nSmile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)\nJust smile, smile for me (Smile)\n(What you lookin' all sad for?\nNigga, you black, smile for me now)\nSmile for me\n(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)\nWon't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)\nJust smile (And the next generation)\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nNow, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts\nAnd you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote\nAnd I can walk you through the days that I done\nI often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer\nHave you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game\nOverlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?\nLook back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain\nTurnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine\nToo many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain\nAnd a man without a focus, life could drive him insane\nStuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change\nBut when I focus on reality we broke and in chains\nHad a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big\nOver football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did\nAnd after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child\nAll my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!\n\n[Hook: Johnny P]\nSmile for me, won't you smile?\nJust smile, smile for me\nSmile for me\nWon't you smile? Just smile\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nFuck the world, as we unloading witness furious speeds\nUnanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's\nBackstabbed and bleedin'\nCrooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'\nDuckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'\nInhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames\nWill I be smothered by my own pain?\nStrange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us\nTakin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us\nHit us off, give us plenty centuries\nForgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries\nThe best revenge is \"Fuck friends!\" \u2013 we military minded soldiers\nBustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah\nTo help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy\nScared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies\nMaybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain\nEmbrace my words, make the world change\nAnd still I smile, nigga\n\n[Bridge: Scarface]\nAnd now a moment of silence, let us pray\nAnd as you journey into outerspace\nMay the angels help to lead the way\nMay the prayers that our families made\nShine up on your soul to keep you safe\nAnd all the homies that done passed away\nThey there to greet you as you pass the gates\nAnd as you headed to the tunnel's light\nI hope it leads to eternal life\nWe say the prayers for our homie 'Pac\n\n[Hook: Johnny P]\nSmile, smile for me\nAll you need to do is smile\nWoooo smile for me\nCome on, smile for me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d5780b3cca2fb2c3c78335faed55238d.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
