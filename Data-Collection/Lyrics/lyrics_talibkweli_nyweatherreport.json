We venture capitalists\nIf it's a product, then we got it for sale\nWhen I first started to spell, my words fell into rhymes\nTurned into songs, everything else fell into line\nI painted pictures you could see, the people bleed in my bars\nWhen I was a teen I was mean, about to reach for the stars\nSo if I fell, I fell right in the cloud, tighten the valve\nNiggas is watered down, used to be no bitin' allowed\nNow they gangstas, no cryin' allowed\nYou probably see a fight on the stage before you see a fight in the crowd\nI send this out to my people facin' the storm, homey we ridin' it out\nYou inspire what I'm writin' about\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear\nNew York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere\nI came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow\nWhatever the weather, we ride, let my people go\nTo the place where knowledge is born\nWe walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out\n\n[Scratching]\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha)\nWe ain't fuckin around (uh uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm not a judge, but I'm handin' out sentences\nFor political prisoners, and regular inmates with no visitors\nNiggas in the street outside the reach of the ministers\nNot those that say \"spiritual,\" but actual partitioners\nRap listeners who be openin' Black businesses\nThis underground shit with samples that lack clearances\nOnce you get past appearances, you can tell whose shit is fake\nOr whose shit is based on past experience\nYou really been to war hand to hand like crack sales\nBuilding man to man, they tryna kill off the black male\nFemales left to raise up her son, from the day he was one\nTil he twenty and he raise up a gun\nAnd get to blazin' for his place in the sun\nThe smoke grazin' his lung, young in his years and he facin' a ton\nNone of his peers wanna share the role of child care provider\nBut they'll hit a nigga blunt and share saliva\nYou ain't a rider and you hustlin' backwards\nToo many equate success with imitating these crackers\nSo our kids lookin' up to drug dealers and rappers\nWe takin' all the work away from the Black actors\nRevelation is first and Armageddon is after\nTsunamis and hurricanes, natural disasters\nThe fast food culture, speed is always a factor\nInstant gratification, they want the cash faster\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my blood, sweat, tears, years of struggle, love, hate, fear\nNew York City, you can make it here you can make it anywhere\nI came prepared for the rain, hail, sleet, snow\nWhatever the weather, we ride, let my people go\nTo the place where knowledge is born\nWe walk into the third eye of the storm, check it out\n\n[Scratching]\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the third eye of the storm\nIt's the place where knowledge is born\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha, ha)\nCheck it out (ha, ha, ha)\nTalib Kweli\nThat's what it is, break it down\n\n[Scratching]\nParanorm, I perform through a storm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36dc52e92a9d27102149cf08b1a7f326.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
