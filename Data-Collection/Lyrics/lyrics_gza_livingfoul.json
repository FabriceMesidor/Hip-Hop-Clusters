They go the opposite way\n\nChorus: Of living foul, you're living foul\n\nThe words right now flowing off my tongue\nIs for the old, the young, the one's that's strong\nThose who are worshippers of diamonds and gold\nYou should not be bought and you should not be sold\nThose who always want but does not need\nIs slightly controlled by the hands of greed\nIf you rob, steal, backstab and abduct\nSooner or later you will self-destruct\n\nChorus: You're living foul", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
