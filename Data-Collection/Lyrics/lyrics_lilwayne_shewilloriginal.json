Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful\nLife on the edge, I'm dangling my feet\nI tried to pay attention but attention paid me\nHaters can't see me: nose-bleed seats\nAnd today I went shopping and talk is still cheap\nI rock to the beat of my drum set\nI been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet\nBut I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit\nNow jump up on that dick and do a full split!\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nI tell her \"go on! Pop that pussy for me\"\nHaters can't see me but bitches still looking for me\nAnd you could take it to the bank and deposit that\nPut your two cents in and get a dollar back\nSome people hang you out to dry like a towel rack\nI'm all about \"I\" give the rest of the vowels back\nI like my girl thick, not just kinda fine\nEat her til she cry, call that \"wine and dine\"\nTry to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses\nThey say \"choose wisely\" that's why I was chosen\nRocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault\nLooked in the face of death and took it's mask off\nNow I like my house big and my grass soft\nI like my girl's face South and her ass North\nBut I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit\nNow hop up on that dick and do a full split!\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nPandemonium, she cause that\nToss it up, and I stuff 'em where her draws at\nThat's on everything like feets that's on my floor mats\nRed bottoms, spikes on 'em, that's dos stacks\nSpeakin' Spanish while she tannin', body no fat\nShawty body body got me on my 4th stack\nPink champagne, order Mo\u00ebt\nRollin' airplanes, where I land at?\nI levitate over numbers you niggas never make\nThe Columbians callin', I tell 'em \"perate\"\nEvery summer I celebrate with a new estate\nLet's get the fuck out this club, call it the great escape\nShe wrap her lips 'round a nigga, just like a chinchilla\nCrap table Bellagio, I'm a big tipper\nMy life a stage I need her just to stand on it\nEvery time she look back, I toss a band on it\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back, told me baby it's real\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f903dae2533e450c8d3cb233aa846020.745x745x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
