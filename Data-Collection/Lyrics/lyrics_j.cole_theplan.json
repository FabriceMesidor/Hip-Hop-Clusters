Way off\nThese are the things that dreams are made of\nThe sweep, no time for sleep, when you're elite\nIf what you reap is what you sow, then what was you expecting?\nExpect to come in second\nWhile I become a legend\n\n[Hook]\nOne time for the plan\nStraight to the top, I got the power in my hands\nLive for the moment, be hot\nAct like you want it, reach high\nNow we ain't known, but we try\nNow holla back and reply\n\nOne time for the plan\nStraight to the top, I got the power in my hands\nLive for the moment, be hot\nAct like you want it, reach high\nNow we ain't known, but we try\nNow holla back and reply\n\n[Outro]\nWhy don't you reach for the sky?\nYou don't believe you can fly?\nI guess I'll see you when you get here\nI guess I'll see you when you get here\n\nWhy don't you reach for the sky?\nYou don't believe you can fly?\nI guess I'll see you when you get here\nI guess I'll see you when you get here\n\n[Hook]\nOne time for the plan\nStraight to the top, I got the power in my hands\nLive for the moment, be hot\nAct like you want it, reach high\nNow we ain't known, but we try\nNow holla back and reply", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cd936e786e1ab454043327d585c7702.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
