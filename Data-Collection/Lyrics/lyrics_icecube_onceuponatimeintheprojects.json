Freeze, I'll kill ya!)\nThe cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome\nAnd I said to myself, \"once again it's on\"\nHe threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin' no slack\nJumped on my head and put his knee in my back\nFirst he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up\nThey couldn't do it so they cuffed me up\nI said, \"fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take\"\nHey yo officer you're making a big mistake\nSince I had on a shirt that said I was dope\nHe thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case\nHe said, \"get out my face\" and musta had a grudge\nHis reply, \"Tell that bullshit to the judge\"\nThe girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin'\nI said \"Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'\"\nShe started draggin' and all of a sudden\nWe all got tossed in the paddy wagon\nNow I beat the rap but that ain't the point\nI had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint\nNow the story you heard has one little object\nDon't fuck with a bitch from the projects", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f06b79102935bc9ab2c8c140b5cfc05a.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
