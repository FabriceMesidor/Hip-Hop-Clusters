LL Cool J, Kathy Megestro & Heike Thurjung\nDear Mallika\nI've been missing you in my soul\nHaven't seen you in what seems like centuries\nI'm so cold\nAnd although I know you're safe in paradise\nStill I can't help but worry\nFor your safety I pay any price\nI'm sorry I didn't recognize your fathers struggle\nBut its hard to be understanding with the amounts of task I juggle\nWhen I think of paradise\nAnd the natural spring flowing\nI get jealous of your father\nFearing your love for him might be growing\n**D\u00f4me \u00e9pais, le jasmin a la rose s\u00b4assemble\nRive en fleurs, frais matin, nous appellent ensemble\nSous le d\u00f4me \u00e9pais, o\u00fb le blanc jasmin a la rose s\u00b4assemble\nSur la rive en fleurs, riant au matin\nViens, descendous ensemble**\nDear Mallika\nWhen I held you in my arms\nYour skin was like a rose slightly caressed by the sun\nI chose you before anyone\nWalked through the garden barefoot\nTasting mangoes in the forest\nMy feelings can't be captured by an artist\nIt was beautiful in every heavenly way imagined\nYou're my hero\nFor you Id slay any dragon\nDig tunnels to the depths of my own weakness\nI miss all your grandeur your splendor your sweetness\nYour eloquence fine raiment's sensitivity\nIn a land of thousand paradises\nYou're the epitome\nAnd I'm missing you\nFor love intensifies from yearmin\nI have a smoke filled aura\nFor my insides are burning\nMy love is in your shadows\nMy prayers are always near\nAnd although I live oppressed Mallika\nI have no fear\nFor I know that destiny will cause our paths to cross\nAnd I shall process once more\nThe love I almost lost\nYes, yes\n**Chorus**\nDear Mallika, sweet Mallika\nAs for me sweet Mallika, my country's in upheaval\nMenus hearts have darkened\nSeduced by silent evil\nThey oppress me for colour, class, even religion\nVacuums filled with narcissism sucking up the living\nColonial mentality\nConquerors of peaceful tribes\nI suffocate and grow weary trying to stand in the tide\nBut just knowing that one day Ill have Mallika by my side\nHelps me live on through the storm\nAnd pull the thorns from my side\n**Chorus**\nDear Mallika\nSweet sweet sweet sweet Mallika\nFor an eternity, I shall love you eternally\nWherever you go, my heart goes with you\nIll always love you\nWe will always be one", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36376b2921f53c9d0a5e55337d8f332e.992x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
