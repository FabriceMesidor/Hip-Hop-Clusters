You just diggin' your grave\n\n[Hook]\nGot some soul like De La do\nThey say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu\nEverywhere you go these people hate on you\nIt's deja-vu, deja-vu\nA little soul like De La do\nThey say I'm new, it's nothing but some deja-vu\nEverywhere you go these people hate on you\nDeja-vu, deja-vu\n\n[Verse 3: Mac Miller]\nHypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly\nPotentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy\nNo methamphetamines, hot, 110 degrees\nVisually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED\nWhen I was 17 I thought I had it figured out\nNow I see what it's about, went in down a different route\nIt's crucial, 3 new schools, life with a spoonful\nOf sugar, yea I need my medicine\nFuckin Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president\nRepresent all these fuckin' people that I never met\nSome expect me to be the greatest ever\nHear me on the radio, shit'll change forever\nNow I'm just a pop sensation, fuck your expectations\nI'mma be the best, have some patience\nThought that it was great, then poof!\nIt was nothing but some deja vu, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/83b5cf07c39eb95618f6cf76b5552b11.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
