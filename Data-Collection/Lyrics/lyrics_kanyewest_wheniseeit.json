Yeah, you lie\nSpent the whole summer\nTryna be at the wrong place at the right time\nBut I know what's mine when I see it\nI know, I know, I know when I see it\nRiding down the 405, baby\nPacing, thinking, to myself\nIf I should make it right\nWhen I pulled up to the light\nAnd then my phone started ringing\nDiamonds in the colors of those eyes\nDon\u2019t know why, but I know a sign when I see it", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/dabe4f2a22fba2fa73b763d55f04335f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
