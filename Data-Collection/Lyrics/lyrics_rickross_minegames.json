Kelly, girl I'm bout that foreplay\nSlow it down, speed it up, I'm just being me\nPanamera here's the keys, thats just the G in me\nGot a crib on the water, need a bathing suit\nBond that we share so unbreakable\nHere's a toast to the baddest chick in the room\nThis is not a mind game, but could play them, too\n\n[Hook: Kelly Rowland]\nYou don't have to play mine games\nJust tell me what's yours is mine\nEven when you're far away\nYou come back to me every time\nIt's just me and my babe at the end of the day\nWe ain't gotta play no mind games\nMine games\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nAll-black double R, me and my baby girl\nMe and my baby girl, me and my baby girl\nYou know I'm on the grind so I miss you at times\nAll on my mind as I'm scribbling lines\nI put the weed out, cause it play with my head\nTurning money down, we just laying in bed\nShe blowing money wild, bundles of bread\nTimes are priceless, it can go to your head\nI think my mind blown, I barely feel my feet\nI'mma hold my head high even in defeat\nIt's not a mind game so don't even think\nEven if it was, it'd be over 'fore you blinked\n\n[Hook: Kelly Rowland]\nYou don't have to play mine games\nJust tell me what's yours is mine\nEven when you're far away\nYou come back to me every time\nIt's just me and my babe at the end of the day\nWe ain't gotta play no mind games\nMine games\n\n[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]\nThe sky is the limit\nLet's take over the world and everything in it\nMe and my baby gonna ride to the finish, down from beginning\nOoh what a feeling, ooh what a feeling\n\n[Interlude: Rick Ross]\nMe against the world, me and my baby girl\nMe and my baby girl, me and my baby girl\nDouble R, me and you, taking over the world\nTaking over the world, taking over the world\n\n[Hook: Kelly Rowland]\nYou don't have to play mine games\nJust tell me what's yours is mine\nEven when you're far away\nYou come back to me every time\nIt's just me and my babe at the end of the day\nWe ain't gotta play no mind games\nMine games\n\n[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]\nYou don't have to play mine games\nJust tell me what's yours is mine\n\n[Interlude: Rick Ross]\nMe against the world, me and my baby girl\nMe and my baby girl, me and my baby girl\nDouble R, me and you, taking over the world\nTaking over the world, taking over the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5903bd99ee5e7d63a99dda93648f4272.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
