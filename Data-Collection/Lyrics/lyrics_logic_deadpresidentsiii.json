This is my house, you fuckers just lease\nWaitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest\nBlack and white like a nun\nThese up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn\nSo follow your father like an apostle\nPaint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil\nNever knowing what's gon' follow\nHowever we never wallow in our sorrow\nJust pray for tomorrow\nAt times my heart could be hollow\nEmotions forced to be swallowed\nWhile neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo\nThis is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder\nLife's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you\nSo I'm trying to find her\nOne moment she'll love you then swallow\nYou whole like an anaconda\nThe bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky\nI'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain\nSpit flame like propane\nBitches I overcame you know the name\nInk in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page\nTo numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker\n\n[Hook]\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\n\n[Verse 2]\nAllow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic\nMurderin' every demographic\nPaint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic\nRip the mic to set the example\nWhile all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples\nConstant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die\nSociety expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I\nBut we persevere force feed enemies truth serum\nWe want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased\nIn your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest\nBustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it\nI get from point A to point B by keeping it G\nAin't no killer but don't push me\nIf you grab the heat, you a pussy\nKnuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel\nI have not a single enemy\nOnly evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind\n'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme\nAnd when it comes to dames I catch planes\nThey catch feelings\nHaters keep my name in they mouth like fillings\nHigh as the ceiling\nY'all really don't know who your dealing with now\nVisions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen\nThankful for every breath I'm givin'\nFuck social division\nOn the road to success and there ain't no time for collision\nPeople ask \"how you get your flow so amazing\"\nTo which I reply \"I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions\"\nHaters takin' shots they never graze him\nNow if pro is the opposite of con\nWhat's the opposite of progress?\nI love my country but that shit a mess\nGrew up on section 8, I can attest\nAnd now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best\n\n[Hook]\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it\nNow run it back and retrieve it\nTill you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind\nOnly 22 but I feel like I'm 99\nBack in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme\nSurrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine\nDaddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom\nFasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan\nI was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime\nAt 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well\nBut my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?\nSo I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own\nI left home at 17\nShortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets\nBut she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving\nSo many rappers biting me you would think they was teething\nAnd now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cb73fd1e86a44f861bc4ba694c17126.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
