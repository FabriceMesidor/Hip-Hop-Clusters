You know you wanna roll with a nigga\nI'm tryna fuck, if you decide to go with a nigga\nI'll tear it up, in the telly you'll be loving a nigga\nI'll work that, work that, yeah I'll work that, work that\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nIt's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage\nHarder than the politician on the campaigne\nNo games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing\nLet me see you back it up 'til you pull a hamstring\nFace fuck, girl go for broke\nSo hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat\nThen Havoc on the floor\nI don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show\nHalf-ass dress, smelling like sex\nDried up nutt on her neck\nThey don't call us the master of the tour for nothing\nWe destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking\nCatch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd\nAnd that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey\nShe'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus\nHere's the hot line bitch, call us\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/796af50ac59c2535e57e1fca6de975b5.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
