We shoot niggas. All day. Keep them hollows nigga. They got\nNew little guns. New little joints with long baby missiles in it. Them the\nJoints we play with nigga. The Einsteins is on nigga. Hard bottoms in\nThe hoodie. Ice Water nigga. Word up. General Shala Raekwon. All day\nE'day. A professional. Yeah. Get that money niggas. Don't never give up\nThem guns.
