(*Gunshots*)\n6ix, come on get up!\nI'm shot, I'm shot! What? I'm shot! (*Gunshots*)\nGet the fuck on the ground!\nAww, fuck, fuck!\nThey got me!\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe bleedin' slow, blood dripping from his torso\nWill he ever get to see his son grow?\nWhat's the picture they gon' paint after he go?\nLast song he ever sung when the bullet hit his lung\nMan, I shoulda never called, he'd be alive if he ain't come\nAll he tried to do was help save my wife\nWish I could've saved his life, I wish I could take it back\nNow my best friend's life curtain call, fade to black\nIt just ain't no turning back, pulled out the gat\nAnd put a bullet through the man in blue and it came out his back\nJump in the whip, no looking back\nFirst time in the front seat of that white and black\nSide streets through the city, ain't nobody fucking with me\nYeah, you know I had to duck 'em all, screamin' \"Motherfuck the law\"\nNext thing I saw was a block from my crib\nThinkin' 'bout my shorty, she my rib\nPull up in the driveway\nNo cops in sight but just might somehow pull up my way\nOpen the stash, get the cash, now I'm back out\nSo I put the Audi in reverse and then I back out\nLook at the addy in the text with my girl whereabouts\nFive minutes later, now I'm creeping in a warehouse\nLot of goons, lot of guns, now I'm shooting just for fun\nI don't give a fuck where they come from, I'm killing everyone\nFinally make it to the back, all alone, pitch black\nHear a sound, what was that? Think it came from over there\nLights on, now I see my wife, she's tied up to a chair\nWith a gun to her head and a man gripping her hair\nAll I did was stop and stare, he took the gag out of her mouth\nAnd she started calling my name (Bobby!) but didn't seem to be in pain\nReally shaken up (Bobby!), I felt like I was waking up\nSo I shot him quick in the neck and he hit the floor (Bobby)\nBefore I untied her, I shot him four more times\nPut a bullet in his spine, was he dead? (Bobby!) Let's see (Bobby!)\nStaring at the man, gun in his hand, it couldn't be (Bobby!)\nThe man who kidnapped my wife (Bobby!) was me (Bobby!)\n\n[Outro: Logic & Kevin Randolph]\nBobby!\nWhat? What\u2014what?\nMan, get your ass up nigga, we at the studio!\nSay what?\nDamn, man. C'mon, hurry up, man! What's wrong with you?\nWake up, here. Come on\nWait, we're at the studio right now? We're here already?\nDamn, man, since you started smoking weed you always fucking late!\nMan, shut the fuck up Kev\nStoney Bob neck ass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04d1c970904a534f622b012d9599fc9b.440x440x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
