{"songs": [{"title": "The Daily\u2019s Fashion Los Angeles Awards Speech", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "You know, one connection that I have, you know, to, I believe everyone in this room, but especially with like me and Virgil and Don C and Fonzworth Bentley and all the people from the infamous Tommy Ton then transferred to South Park photo. Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that\u2019s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. [?]. \u201cYou\u2019re my M.A.S. and I\u2019m your Nicholas.\u201d And her brother\u2019s a doctor. And somehow in her family she\u2019s looked at like she didn\u2019t do as much  in her life \u2018cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit together\n\nAnd I honest.. I\u2019mma jump to a point just so I don\u2019t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I\u2019m a Christian, I\u2019m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we\u2019re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we\u2019re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they\u2019re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, \u201coh, you\u2019re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.\u201d No knock to lawyers, but you know what I\u2019m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - \u201cI wanna be in the middle of that conversation.\u201d As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, \u201cI wanna be in the middle of that conversation.\u201d Nah, I\u2019m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, \u201cyou think you not part of fashion because you don\u2019t datatata.\u201d Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let\u2019s make the conversation, you know, let\u2019s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl\u2019s\u2019 or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currency\n\nWhen we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew \u2018cause he\u2019s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say \u201cwow,\u201d you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that\u2019s word fashion insiders, but everyone\u2019s a fashion insider, you know. It\u2019s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it\u2019s, the point I wanna make before I bring \u2018em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design \u2018cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, \u201cKanye you can\u2019t get in this show \u2018cause you\u2019re a celebrity\u201d or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley\u2019s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I\u2019m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I\u2019mma say what the fuck he should\u2019ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don\u2019t even know if I made one fucking good point\n\nBut what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn\u2019t figure out where my office was. We didn\u2019t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We\u2019d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn\u2019t about me being a celebrity \u2018cause it could\u2019ve been like, \u201cwhat do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..\u201d All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I\u2019m closing now. I don\u2019t move, I don\u2019t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don\u2019t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I\u2019m so happy that Jeremy is here \u2018cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I\u2019m not gonna say shit else. So all I\u2019mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
