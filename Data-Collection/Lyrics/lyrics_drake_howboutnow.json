Yo, you cheesed me dog\n\n[Verse 1]\nAlways felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture\nCrazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you\nCrazy how even when it miss you\nShit'll come back around and get you\nCrazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas\nRemember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?\nRemember when you had to take the bar exam\nI drove in the snow for you? Yeah\nYou probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then\nBut how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now (Stuck right now)\nOh, you thought you had it all figured out back then\nBut how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)\nYou thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl\nHow 'bout now? Yeah\nGirl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?\nWhat about now, girl, how 'bout now?\n\n[Interlude]\nMy heart belongs to you...\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, always been daddy's little angel\nI bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas\nHe ain't even say thank you\nI had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music\nI used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit\nYou be like \"who's this?\" I be like \"me, girl\"\nYou be like \"oh, word, true shit?\"\nThen ask if we could listen to Ludacris\nThem car rides made me feel like I was losin' it\nYeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that\nOr I was average like that\nStarted drinkin' way more than I used to\nPeople form habits like that, girl\nYeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year\nI'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year\nGuess I just had to pretend that year\nI ain't even see my friends that year\nPlaces that I should've been\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then\nBut how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now (Stuck right now)\nOh, you thought you had it all figured out back then\nGirl, how 'bout now? (Now)\n'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)\nAnd you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)\nYou thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl\nHow 'bout now? Yeah\nGirl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?\nWhat about now, girl, how 'bout now?\n\n[Outro]\nMy heart belongs to you\nWhatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do\nWhatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do\nWhatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do\nWhatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54d7a9d2f6ec7438219f30ec200a6984.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Drake"}
