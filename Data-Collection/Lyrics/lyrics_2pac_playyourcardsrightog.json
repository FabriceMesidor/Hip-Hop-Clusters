Mean]\nDecember 30 in nineteen-ninety feen yeah\nMy reincarnation steps in, born into a world that don't love itself, but the love is wealth\nMy little nigga listen closely, if you don't remember nothing else\nJust remember that life ain't nothing but a game\nA gamble, and how you play yo hand will sho' explain\nFor what's ever\nIn times you gone journey into a crossroad, get lost tho'\nKeep on bailin' and let 'em see you up in floss mode\n\n[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]\nMysteriously it seems\nThrough my deepest thoughts and dreams\nIt's all wrong,  Pop too long gone\nAnd now way it seems I'm stranded on my own\nAbandoned here in a zone\nProtect my throne\nPow like king Al Capone style\nFake no jacks on this grind\nCoked up with crack I get mine\nLiving life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton\nWith my future behind me, livin' with these snakes\nSent here to blind me, one day I know my future's gonna find me\nAm I crying?\n\n[Chours: K-Ci and Jo-Jo]\nIf you play your cards right, everything will be alright\nIf you play your cards right, tonight will be the night\nIf you play your cards right, everything will be alright\nIf you play your cards right, tonight will be the night\n\n[Outro: Pac talking]\nWould you be patient, and you take your time\nAnd you finess it, 9 times out of 10\nHomeboy you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed\nBut if you rush and you just be manhandlin'\nYou can and yo ass can go home tonight Haha\nPlay your cards right", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
