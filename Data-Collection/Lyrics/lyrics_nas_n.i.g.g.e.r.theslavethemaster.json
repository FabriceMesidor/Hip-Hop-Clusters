You the question and the answer\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us\nPowdered eggs and government cheeses\nThe calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus\nGotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers\nSchools with outdated books, we are the forgotten\nSummers, cooling off by the fire hydrant\nYeah I'm from the ghetto\nWhere old black women talk about their sugar level\nIt's not unusual\nTo see photos of dead homies funerals\nAluminum foil on TV antennas\nLittle TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners\nGirls dye their hair with Kool-Aid\nThey gave us lemons, we made lemonade\nBut this nigga's paid, ancestry of slaves\nDescendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling\nPut rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us\nWe were scholars long before colleges\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, but still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, we are the slave and the master\nWhat you looking for? You the question and the answer\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo I mean it like a slave master, nigga?\nNo I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers\nMy abbreviation was young when I caught the cases\nThat should mean the court could see my changes\nTake off the bracelets\nSavage when broke, smoke sour diesel, need no Bowflex\nMy chest still cut up like a bag of dope\nThought patterns consist of boss matters\nSpit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth\nToast to government cameras peeping us, every week I must\nHave my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs\nBut this is what I was dreaming of\nBetween cutting hard coke with new razors slicing my fingers up\nThey used to string us up, we wanted everything\nBut the one bringing us cake be the snakes like the\nLike the New Jack City wedding scene\nNo time for mistakes, trying to get it like Medellin\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us\nWe were scholars long before colleges\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, but still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, we are the slave and the master\nWhat you looking for? You the question and the answer\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy nig', what up my nig'? Yep!\nPeople afraid of criticism\nBut I always put myself in a sacrificial position\nThey been know I ain't just rapping for fame\nI got my old homie's half-sister father asking for chains\nYep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter\nThey see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war\nThey got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more\nSo now my enemies are at my front door\n'Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence\nThey calling it reverse racism\nStill to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'\nI'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me\nYou'll always know where to find me\nThey say the close ones will hurt you\nSo let's keep a small circle\nOn the road to riches and diamond rings\nIn the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us\nWe were scholars long before colleges\nThey say we N-I double G-E-R, we are\nMuch more, but still we choose to ignore\nThe obvious, we are the slave and the master\nWhat you looking for?
