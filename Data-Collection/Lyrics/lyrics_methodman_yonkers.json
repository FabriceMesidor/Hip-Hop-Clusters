They do you just like King\nNow I can hear the night scream, sirens and light beams\nPopping off bad shots, hitting people that they ain't mean to pop\nThe neighborhood\u2019s in shock, block extremely hot\nAnother Black teen shot, that\u2019s dull routine to cops\nMake sure they got good grades, work the minimum wage\nNow he\u2019s laying on that stretcher, with nothing in him to save\nKeep the ghetto, in whatever ghetto you at\nJust don\u2019t love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don\u2019t love you back\nYou don\u2019t live until you\u2019ve made your first million\nAnd top models wanna have your children\nI thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children\nWay before rap moved crack in your building\nYeah, now what\u2019s the price of rice in China?\nThese women trying to raise the price on their vagina\nMe? I\u2019m trying to live the life and get the grind up\nLike Diddy, but I ain\u2019t trying to give the shine (Shyne) up\nPoppa, pop-off no question, ya\u2019ll dirty, like it raw, (no protection)\nWhen the kid hold court, no objection\nMeth needed money at the door, no exception\nI go hard in the paint on a rapper\nI go harder on a pussy no Viagra\nYou think I\u2019m tripping, ain\u2019t into tricking\nBut I keep a snow bunny in the kitchen\nI\u2019m the master like Killa", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe6629f7a5e6af0aa38ca87547ced96f.1000x562x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
