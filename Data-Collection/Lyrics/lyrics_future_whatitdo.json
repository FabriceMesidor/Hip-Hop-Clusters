What it do, baby?\nWhat it do, baby? What it do?\n\n[Verse]\nReal talk, I'm fuckin' with you and you know it\nAin't just talkin' with you, baby, I'm a poet\nAyy, I just throwed a couple G's on your feet\nI just throwed a couple G's on your feet\nI'm just ballin' just to show you we can ball\nAyy, why you callin'? Girl, you know that I'm a dawg\nPlay your position, can't be playin' niggas cheap\nNiggas like me would put sand sheets on your seat\nWe be fuckin' in the AM, I'ma hit you past 3\nAyy, that's the same way that I fell for you\nI used to come through, roll some L's with you\nWe shared a bond and the bid was long overdue\nThat's why we was in here drinkin' Hennessy\nWe tryna get out all our memories (You remember that?)\nAin't none of your ex's my enemy\nThey damn sure ain't no friend of me (No)\nWhat got me to this point?\nI'm really fuckin' with you, spendin' cash on that ass\nGot to layin' up with you, pulled off when I smashed\nYou let me have my way, I got this good girl goin' bad\nI ain't treat you like trash, what I'm really tryna ask\nWhat it do, baby?\n\n[Chorus]\nThen I copped the coupe for you no time\nThen I copped a Rollie for you both times\nThen I stepped your fashion game up lately\nI'm just tryna ask you, what it do, baby?\nWhat it do, baby?
