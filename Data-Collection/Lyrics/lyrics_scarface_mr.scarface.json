(Fred) Who?\nWho the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door\nBy that time someone jumped in the window\nNow what the fuck was I do?\nThe bitch packed a twenty-two\nHit him in his head, there she laid him\nThe nigga standin' by the door I sprayed him\nAnd headed for the back\nI seen that same old brown Cadillac\nIt kinda fucked me up at first\nCause the nigga that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse\nI opened up fire on the ride G\nWho I was shootin for was standin right behind me\nI had a double barrel pointed at my ass\nCould this be the end of Mr. Brad?\nI don't know what happened to the slut\nWell that's about the time the closet door it opened up\n(On your ass trick!\nI'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!)\nHeh, five-0's on my ass, mane\nThey know me by the face, but they don't know my last name\nNow I'm back on the case\nYeah, just call me Mr. Scarface", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bfc55f1e39dab482dd5f87425202cda6.453x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
