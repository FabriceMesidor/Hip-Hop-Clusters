I'm all you see, I'm all you see\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi & Billy Craven]\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\nI told you so\nThis will be my world\n\n[Outro]\nYeah-ay-ohh-ohh\nYeah-ay-ohh-ohh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efc07c09f2ac2b595d950ffcf79a1a73.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
