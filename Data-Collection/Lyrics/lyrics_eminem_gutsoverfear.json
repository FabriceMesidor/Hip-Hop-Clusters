My Name Is\u201d dropped\nStarted thinking my name was Fault\n\u2018Cause any time things went wrong\nI was the one who they would blame it on\nThe media made me the equivalent\nOf a modern-day Genghis Khan\nTried to argue it was only entertainment, dog\nGangster? Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me\nThat I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\", I pondered\nI just wanna play my part\nShould I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful\nOr disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face\nBefore you get made pissed off\nAnd keep plugging, it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it\u2026 ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times\nHow many times can I say the same thing\nDifferent ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt\nWhen I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia]\nI was a\u2026 afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear, the time is near\nGuts over fear, might shed a tear\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me down\nNow I got guts over fear, guts over fear\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nFeels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI know what it was like, I was there once\nSingle parents, hate your appearance\nAs you struggle to find your place in this world\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park\nAnd the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen\n\u2018Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song\nBut I rather make \u201cNot Afraid 2\u201d\nThan make another motherfucking \u201cWe Made You,\u201d ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent\nWhen I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on\nAnd gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n\u2018Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust having to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, \u2018cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house\nAnd found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did\nWas dreamt of one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar\nYou are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say\nDon't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk\nTake it with a grain of salt\u2014and eat their fucking faces off!\nThe legend of the angry blond\nLives on through you when I\u2019m gone, and to think I was a\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia]\nI was a\u2026 afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI didn't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nGuts over fear, the time is near\nGuts over fear, might shed a tear\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nI let you keep me down\nNow I got guts over fear, guts over fear", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8bd94a9d90fcc26e35695ce1d6c302d0.300x300x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
