She say, \"Weezy Fuckin' Baby\"\nI say, \"Yes in-fuckin'-deed,\" she say, \"Don't you ever leave\"\nI say, I say, \"But I got money on my mind\"\nThen I tell her never mind and we do it one more time [laugh]\nFor a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home\n\n[Hook]\nGirl, you are so fine\nI wish that I could get you over here, girl\nTonight, so I can get my grown man on with you\nYou don't know about it, I'm on my grown man\n\n[Bridge: Lil Wayne]\nDamn, look, that\nOh, that right there?\nThat's the sunset girl\nGet your visor, where those Chanel shades I get you, you always losing things\nAnd I'm always buying new things, I come a long way huh, remember?\nRemember that block, look at you, you think you all grown\n\n[Outro:]\nYou ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world\nAnd I'm a grown man, the women understand\nSee what I go through, is what I owe you\nAnd you should throw that ass back to me right now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/98c56aa11e01a9c25b7485cc3a25c78f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
