And we never kiss no asses\nGet your own\nAnd the reason we run the streets is to take care of your home\nA nigga better put his kid first\nBad karma\nLil' niggas putting in work\nFuck Harvard\nImpalas they wanna peel first\nOr a Charger\nAnd shorty want her titties done\nCertain doctor\nNew apartment in the inner city, smokin out\nI'm wit ? so at least gonna smoke an ounce\nI live this shit nigga it's not a fable tale\nCome and work for the boss, You know I am paying well\n\n[Hook: KC]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aa7d5a9ab574e2c211041d1a3cd2e07b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
