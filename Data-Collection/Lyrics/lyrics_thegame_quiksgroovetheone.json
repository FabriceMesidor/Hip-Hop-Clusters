dick up out this bitch mouth\nI'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something\nMultitasking, cooking breakfast\nMaking a nigga wanna smack that ass\nSee, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride\nI said, \"If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive.\"\nCause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't\nI'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam\nThey had the bomb,\nAnd if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga\nI push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron\nMake a nigga disappear like J-Kwon\nBody found by the Swans\nNigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing\nI'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if he do or don't die\nHe ain't never coming back\nNow it's one, two, buckle my shoe\nPatent leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do\nIt's the P-I-R-to-the-U\nAnd I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo\nYay yay, I said I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate, celebration\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Verse 2: DJ Quik]\nYeah, Quik is the name\nWith The Game, it's a goddamn shame\nNiggas can't see that we to blame\nFor putting Compton to flames\nIgnite it up, haters knotted up\nWhen you trip with canker sores in your whip\nThat's what I do, to protect my party\nMy goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy\nThen its back to shawty, all the ladies drink free\nAll the players grab a tab, that's how that's supposed to be\nDrinking Casamigos, fucking faster than grand national regals\nI'm in it in the pussy doing kegals\nI'm so Fred Segal right now\nShe so spread eagle right now\nAin't nothing but the clothes going down\nI'm in the game and the fire's the same\nMy music is infinite like even before my fame\nI wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses\nAnd I'm still coming off like this my first hit\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate, celebration\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nNow DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay\nSay she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize\nYou ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?\nAnd had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?\nTreat my dick like a newborn, hold the head\nI told a bitch \"Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared\nSo stop that bickering,\" I got a bitch from the Nickersons\nThat got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh\n\n[Verse 4: DJ Quik]\nI'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new\nSomething more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to\nSo lady, go on and work those hips\nLike them inmates work those divs\nAnd when I get there baby work your lips\nIf it don't make dollars don't holler\nIt's DJ Quik in any year Impala\nAnd if it don't make sense then don't flinch\nWhat you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass?\nNo shit\n\n[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]\nI hope you giving head today\nCause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)\nBaby we gon' celebrate\nYou bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one\nOne you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one\nI only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one\nBut you know I'm always open to suggestions\nI said let me be the one\nDown for you, it should never be a question, babe\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nTo blow your mind, away, away, my time\nDon't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time\nTo blow your mind, to blow your mind\n\n[Outro: DJ EZ Dicc (Ricky Harris)]\nShe's sucking on my dick\nShe's a bad, bad girl\nUh, h-hold on, hold on, baby\nYour head hit the button, girl\nWe on the li-\nZ-boy fro, yo man are we live?\nWe still live, huh?\nDamn girl, don't stop though\nHit you off with something brand new\nA Travis Barker produced joint, believe it or not\nHold on, let me hit this button", "image":
