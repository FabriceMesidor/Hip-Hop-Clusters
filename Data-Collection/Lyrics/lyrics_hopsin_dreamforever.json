Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wake up in the morning with this sensational pain\nIt goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain\nEngraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change\nIt is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained\nYour love is magic\nDaydreaming about you is such a habit\nThought I saw you when I was driving\nBut I was stuck in traffic\nIf other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken\nI tell em' scram cause they need to know I'm happily taken\nYou see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you\nFellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you\nI know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust\nBut once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut\nYour touch is that of a goddess\nWhen we kiss, I'm at a lack of words\nEspecially when we pull away\nAnd then you smile afterwards\nIn our hearts, we're no different in color\nWe live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other\nI love you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nOnly when the moon is shining\nThat's when you are beside me\nGirl, I need you\nAnd that's real\nI don't wanna wake up\nI'll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI'm really hoping I find you\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams\nI sit and fiend for you when I'm awake\nAnd it seems like I\u2019ll never be happy unless I sleep\nI failed to see the point in living without you\nIt got me thinking death is sweet\nI\u2019ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars\nCause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately\nWhat I'm about to do I kept discrete\nI rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep\nTake me to ecstasy\nI tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse\nI love you more than anything, I won\u2019t even put God first\nYou\u2019re the only reason that I sleep so often\nI'm hurting nights I don\u2019t see you\nI just keep on tossing and turning\nI feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good\nI told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would\nSo baby here I go with the proof, this is it\nThe moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*\n\n[Bridge]\nWhere are you? Are you only in my dreams?\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI\u2019ll stay asleep (You know baby)\nYour love is all I need\nI\u2019m really hoping to find you\n\n[Outro]\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna, don\u2019t wanna wake up\nI don\u2019t wanna wake up I\u2019ll stay asleep", "image": "https://images.genius.com/89f3b594c1d21cb0ced76a0e54600701.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
