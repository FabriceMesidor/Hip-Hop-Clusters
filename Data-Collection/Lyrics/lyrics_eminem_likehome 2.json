He's tryin' to divide us\nThis shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us\n'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does\nSimilar to when two cars collide 'cause\nOur spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one\nBut here the jaws of life come\nTo pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from\nWhen we can\u2019t from our stars and stripes cause\nThis type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal\nBut there's always tomorrow still\nIf we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal\nAnd band together for Charlottesville\nAnd for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals\nNevada get up, hit the damn resetter\nLet's start from zero, this is our renewal\nSpray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better\nAmerica, and here's to where it all\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]\nAnd here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)\nHere's to the land that made me\nAnd made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)\nHere's to the land that raised me\nThis one for the only place that really knows me\nFor the cracks in the road that drove me\nThere's no place like home\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nDidn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?\nCan't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya\nYou stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off\nNazi, I do not see a way y'all differ\nAnd all you got are race cards, bigot\nThe swastika with your name carved in it\nShould be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off\nAnd you just lick the plate off\nSo I guess it pays to feed off of chaos\nSo basically, you ate off Hitler!\nBut you ain't ruinin' our country, punk\nOr takin' our pride from us, you won't define us\n'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up\nSo much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up\nAgainst this train wreck and take a stand\nEven if it means sittin' when they raise the flag\nTo sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\nThis man just praised a statue of General Lee\n'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics\nTake it back to the Shady national convention\nWish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand\nAt the event or maybe had the wherewithal\nTo know that he was gonna try to tear apart\nOur sacred land we cherish and stand for\nSo, hands in the air, let's hear it for\nThe start of a brand new America\nWithout him and be proud of where we're from\nAnd here's to where we all\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]\nAnd here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)\nHere's to the land that made me\nAnd made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)\nHere's to the land that raised me\nThis one for the only place that really knows me\nFor the cracks in the road that drove me\nThere's no place like home\n\n[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]\nI won't give up\nI won't give up on my home, that so many died for\nYou already know that I won't give up\nI won't give up on my home, that so many died for\nYou already know\nThere's no place like home, no place like home\nWherever I go, no place like home\nNo place like home, no place like home\nWherever I go (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]\nAnd here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)\nHere's to the land that made me\nAnd made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)\nHere's to the land that raised me\nThis one for the only place that really knows me\nFor the cracks in the road that drove me\nThere's no place like home", "image": "https://images.genius.com/edd76153e7ac3ec36be997aea55f32ed.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
