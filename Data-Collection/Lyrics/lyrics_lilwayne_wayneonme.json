(No ceilings)\n\nCome and make it Wayne down on me\n\n[Verse 1]\nWide receiver Weezy, throw the pussy at me\nThe pussy lips smiling, I make the pussy happy\nTake them panties off, the pussy lookin' at me\nI'm the pussy monster, now get the pussy ready\nI like to kiss. She like to kiss\nI deep stroke and make her bite her fist\nThe lights is on, the night is grown\nWe get it poppin' cause we know we can't when wifey home\nCalifornia kush - strong as a Titan - is what I'm lightin' on\nWe get high as fuck then we \"Just Do It\" put your Nikes on\nTattoos on her waist, she like the tattoos on my face\nAnd if there's something she'd like to say\nI let her say it on my microphone\nShe love my style...but that's expected\nShe coming back to you? The chances anorexic\nI knew she had it in her, so I got it out her\nShe give me neck around the clock: I call it \"round the Carter\"\nShe rub my back, she say I'm tight\nShe cook, fuck and clean\nAnd still make her flight!\nFirst-class pussy, crystal glass pussy\nI get it wetter than bass pussy\n\n[Verse 2]\nI likes it thick and red\nRalph Lauren spread\nLady in the streets, porn star in bed\nShe like to fuckfight, so we spar in bed\nShe got that pink pussy, I beat it orange/red\nI fuck American pie and I get foreign head\nShe sit down and ride like I'm a thoroughbred\nShe kiss mine, and I kiss hers back\nIf she's a bad bitch\nShe deserve that\nShe send me pictures to my iPhone\nThen I gotta clear em cause my girl be checking my phone\nI'm in the Bentley with the mind blown\nWhen I'm in that pussy, honey, I'm home\n\n[Bridge]\nYou dun been good, but you can do better\nI dun been wet, but I can get wetter\nCome and make it Wayne down on me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a183c010cf184b2a9fecdfcb8e16142.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
