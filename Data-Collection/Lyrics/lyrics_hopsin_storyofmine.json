Giving me this mediocre lifestyle\nIf I'ma get it then it needs to happen right now\nI'm one week away from jumping off a cliff\nOr putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip\nI know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time\nI stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time\nMan forget it, we both know I'm not\nI just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on gaup\nBut for real though, god man you've got to help me out\n'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route\nFrom now back to the day I was a little kid\nShit ain't even brighten up a little bit\nNow wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you\nYeah I'm cursed and it's the truth\nLooks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot\n\n[Hook 2]\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nI'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)\nY'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P\nThank you for listening to my story (alright)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb33e7a89a5050dc08095e21c220cc15.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
