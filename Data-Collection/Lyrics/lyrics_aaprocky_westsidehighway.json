No sir, hoes get the Uber ride\nOr we can kiss 'til the sun come up\nOr, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up\nShe ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge\nGirl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nOn the highway to my place\nIt's higher than you ever been\nBy to my way, be all day\nMe, you and all your friends\nIn love, fuckin'\nIn love, just too much, ohh\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]\nThese days of preference has no complexion\nYou could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin\nJust light the candle\nCold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble\nAnd she know\nLove with me is like a casino, outside of Reno\nA couple white lines\nA cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio\nHouse keys to P.O\nRide from overseas but that's basic\nWasted, high on the West Side Highway\nDrunk enough to fuck with, face it\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nOn the highway to my place\nIt's higher than you ever been\nBy to my way, be all day\nMe, you and all your friends\nIn love, fuckin'\nIn love, just too much, ohh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3054c642a320e82b70b35c53ad1cc8d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "A$AP Rocky"}
