You're on that other shit\nYou don\u2019t even sound the same, I liked your other shit\nBut we\u2019ll still stand beside you, cause somewhere deep inside you\nThere\u2019s more than what meets the eye\nI swear on the Bible you were my idol\nJust when I thought I give up on everything\nI heard you play this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B]\nI watched my whole life change in a couple of years\nWho woulda ever thought I would have caught the world by the ears\nI swear, this shit is so much bigger than I had figured\nBut if it wasn\u2019t meant to be this wouldn\u2019t be my career\nIt\u2019s like, people only see it the way it appears\nBut they never see the ropes and the pulleys and the gears\nBlood, sweat and tears. We cry blood, all we sweat is tears\nIn the middle of this rap game on the battle field\nAll of these shock jock interviews, tryna phone me\nYou never know who\u2019s gonna try to play you and make you look phoney\nI live and die for my team, these niggas are more than my homies\nWe put it all on the line, we gave up all our belongings for this rap shit\nCause at the end of the day, it ain't just rap shit\nI call it making a way for our survival\nJust when I thought I gave up on everything\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\n\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\n(melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nI dreamed about this familiar melody (melody, melody, melody\u2026)\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum\nDa da dum Da da dum Da da dum", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9eb85bdc30b1c86dc24e4ed55451eb6.590x590x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
