Blige & Kid Cudi]\nThese worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders\nMy pride it won't let me fall victim no more\nThese worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders\nMy pride it won't let me fall victim no more\n\n[Bridge: Kid Cudi]\nLife is like that\nBeat me up and I'll fight right back\nPoof-poof, be gone\nI see the devil linger on\nYeah, stuck in my hell\nLied to my mom and I ain't doing so well\nLord let me in\nI feel like he's my only friend\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]\nYeah, the rager, the menace\nHate me now then hate me when I'm winning\nWork so hard to not go insane\nIt's a full time job to not lose my faith\nOkay, I've been here before\nAlone for the umpteenth time or more\nI'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worry about me\nWhen in fact they probably never gave a fuck about me\n\n[Chorus: Mary J.

Blige]\nYeah, life is like that\nBeat me up and I'm fighting right back\nPoof poof - be gone\nI see the devil linger on\nYeah, I wanna win\nAs long as I can do the work within'\nLord let me in\nI feel like you're my only friend\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Kid Cudi]\nThese worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders\nMy pride it won't let me fall victim no more\nThese worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders\nMy pride it won't let me fall victim no more\n\n[Outro: Kid Cudi]\nYeah, the rager, the menace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/14137476a886859359839ede660df307.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
