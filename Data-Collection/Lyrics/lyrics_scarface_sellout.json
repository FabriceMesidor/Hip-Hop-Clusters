(Face, marchin', mobbin')\nYou said it one more time (Face Mob)\nWhat else? (we keep you)\nNow motherfuckers lay it down\nThe ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here\nMaking bullshit records and ruining rap\nI gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening\nTo these record label bitches instead of doing they thing\nI'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with\nAnd I could never let you talk me into dumb shit\nLike selling out to move a few more units\nJust keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest\nYou fuck around and cross the other side of the track\nCatch you a brick then realize that you can't come back\nI'mma stick to the facts\nFuck it if I don't go two\nThe homies know that Face stay true\nAnd though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change\nBeen the same ever since I stepped in the game\nNow, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit\nProstituting theyself, trying to get them a hit\nSuck a dick\n\n[Hook:]\nYou a sellout nigga\nBow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river\nTalk down nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga\nShow 'em you a foul ass nigga\nYou a sellout nigga and I'mma bust you in your mouth nigga\nShow 'em you a foul ass nigga\n\n[Verse 2:]\nFo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga\nOut here backing it up, while you acting it up\nI can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be\nYou the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC\nYou ain't shit off in the city of Chi\nYou ain't shit off in the Do It or Die\nThey want to skin you alive\nOut here talking like you carrying arms\nWe don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs\nI can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth\nAny city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth\nI know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep\nYou can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat\nI know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself\nYou got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail\nHad you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs\n90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that\nAnd you can sniff a snitch a mile away\nFuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day\n\n[Hook: 2x]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am\nLil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams\nNever ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt\nGot respect from older cats cause I was down for the work\nWhen Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club\nDrunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove\nStood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump\nAnd in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped\nThere it is, can't get this shit no realer than that\nHad a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap\nI done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size\nGot an incredible record, 27 and 5\nAnd the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em\nSo he had to fight me everytime I seen him\nAin't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit\nI study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic\nSo-a, shake your ass and I'mma tell 'em the truth\nFabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do\nJust remember who for real when they tell you they real\nI survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills\n\n[Hook: 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5eb25741266e087e51cc814bb4a051e9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
