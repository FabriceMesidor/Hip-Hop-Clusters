All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some... All she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some...\n\n[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]\nAt a Clippers game on the courtside\nWatch a nigga shoot like a four-five\nThey mad at me too, I got more fire\nWhen these bitches see you \"Go home, Roger\" (Go home, Roger)\nTia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy\nI ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid\nHits on my list, check my archive\nI'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening\nRather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura\nActing blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon\nThe girls that you brought man, where are they from?\nWhere are they from?\nWe were playing Playstation\nWhy you standing there, say some, girl, say some\nNo, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house\n\n[Chorus (Extended): Childish Gambino & Chance the Rapper]\nAll she needed was some...\nAll she needed was some...
