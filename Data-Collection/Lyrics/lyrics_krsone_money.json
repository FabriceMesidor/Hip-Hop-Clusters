No, you takin' a short\nYo, you need the money, of course, you need it to live\n(Yo, what you put your money on, Kris?) Yo, right on my kids\n\n[MC LYte]\nM-o-n-e-y, don't ask why. It IS the root of all evil\nThough very necessary to your livelihood\nIt's all good when you got enough\nTil enough ain't enough and you hit upon rough times\nYou make your money and I'll make mine\n(Yo, we need the...) (Money!)\n\n[KRS-One]\nDon't get me wrong, mistakin' this song\nLike money is not important - yes, it is, just be strong\nIt's the reason for the thievin' and that war goin'on\nIt's the reason that you seein' all these girls in their thong\nIt's the reason that the radio's on\nIt's the reason that you believe if you gotta work from sun-up 'til dawn\nIt's the cravings that connect you to that money you makin'\nYour desire is the fire got you feelin' you slavin'\n\n(Free yourself!) Money doesn't make you the man\n(Be yourself!) A man gets his money in credit(?)\n\nOk, I'ma get this money, really, all day\nBut not to the point where Im goin' the wrong way\nI'ma put my money down on rides and all that\nHook up the house so me and my spouse can fall back\nInvesting my knowledge way beyond college\nWrite books and fly hooks in my cottage\n\nCheese - Kris bling-blingin'? Yo, please!\nMoney is an energy that gets what I need\nI can understand them cats that rap flossin' and frontin'\nIt's all good, they from the hood, never had nothin'\nThey just got they money and everything's sunny\nHear what I'm saying, they preyin', boy, and lookin for bunnies\n\n[MC Lyte]\nDid we floss what we bought\nForgetting that sharing is what we've been taught?\nCause this here gettin' money is an individual sport\nMoney can get me in to the same place where years ago\nMy bros and sisters with black skin\nWere confined to the back door and the kitchen\n\n[KRS-One]\nLast verse, where your cash purse\nReach into your wallet, nothin' alloted, that hurts\nBreath stinkin' you're thinkin', but can't afford Certs\nNeed the dollar and baby hollerin' - no work\nI don't know how you gonna get the dough\nYou could become educated, you could become a ho\nYou could do both, that's like puttin' butter on toast\nThe bread is the knowledge, butter is what gets you that close\n\n[MC Lyte]\nMoney is funny - how a piece of paper can make or break your very existence\nQuick as it come, quick as it go - you better know about the ebb and the flow\nYou get money in droves, trick it on cars and blow\nThrow dollars at black queens cause, for the dough they'll strip their clothes\nAnd for the right amount of money\nA king will pimp his queen into being a ho on a stroll\nLife will always be hard when you choose to make money your god", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ad42a510e6be3523569fba6178f6bcf5.419x382x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
