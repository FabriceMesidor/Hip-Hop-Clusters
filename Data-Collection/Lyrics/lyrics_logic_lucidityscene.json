A musician...\n\n[KAI:]\nWhat?\n\n[THOMAS:]\nI know man, crazy right?\n\n[KAI:]\nNah, what's crazy is...\nOriginal music hasn't been created since Earth!\n\n[THOMAS:]\nI know man. Lucidity...\n\n[KAI:]\nWhat?\n\n[THOMAS:]\nBack then, people had dreams and achieved them in a state of total consciousness. Shit we took for granted was obvious; water, food supply. It's insane to think everyday life for everyone in Babel is the quest for Paradise. I dunno, I guess that's what I'm looking for...\n\n[KAI:]\nWhat, being able to make music?\n\n[THOMAS:]\nNot just that. If the laws are abolished following the migration\u2014we're free dude!\n\n[KAI:]\nWe're not slaves, Thomas...\n\n[THOMAS:]\nWe aren't? You can't do anything outside the cause\u2014not really.
