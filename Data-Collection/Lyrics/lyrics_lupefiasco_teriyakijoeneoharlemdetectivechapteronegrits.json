She's weak. A couple more properly placed palms across the cheeks and she'll be all his.\n\nShe'll make good money for him too. Thick-legged, creole, tall...yeah she's a real winner. I give her two months. I give him three.\n\nTwo months before she wises up and figures out she'll be here forever and three months before she puts a knife in his chest for it.\n\nThat's Neo-Harlem for you. That slow burn then that inferno. And you either wood or fire...ain't no water just Gin to keep it goin.\n\nTwo slick punks gambling they heart out next to the scene. Couple cops shaking down some junky next to that. That's the view from the office\n\n.45 on the desk. Digital cigar burning. Sun-Ra coming out the speakers. Antique Rick Ross poster on the wall. Man I miss hip-hop. Damn shame\n\nMental telephone on vibrate. Mostly getting lost dog calls these days. 10 million worth of Units in the wall safe. Nano-Eames couch for now.\n\nCould really use some pussy. Real pussy not that robotic Kevlar jellyfish these ladies walking around with today. Fake pussy fake furniture.\n\nCHANEL VAGINAL IMPLANTS: Who Says Sex Can't Be Luxurious\"\n\n\"Coach Vaginal Implants: The Next Level\"\n\n\"NIKE Sport Implants: Just Do It\"\n\nThe Sun-Ra reaches its crescendo just as I get a call worth answering. ---1 Million Units!!! Respond For Details--- Money first. I like that\n\nPOW! POW! The cops shot the junky. Streets gonna be alive tonight. Real alive.\nI put on my jacket & head for the diner. I need some grits.\n\nJoin us next time for Chapter 2 of \"TERIYAKI JOE: NEO-HARLEM DETECTIVE\"\n\nA WOLFStudio Production.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c3df61679d5348d24cc5a0dc865540b.533x533x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
