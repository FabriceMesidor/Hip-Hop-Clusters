It's me!)\nOh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh\nOh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh (Darkchild)\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris & Sean Garrett]\n(Hahaha, Luda!)\nRelax and take notes, while I put you up on game\nGet a sweeter connect then if I put you up on 'caine\nBut you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double\nBecause the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble\nThey like a little danger and might not admit it (yeah)\nBut they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it\nPlus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag\nAnd keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags (hey)\nAnd Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to him (yeah)\nI like open toe straps, but SG talk to him\nI got a whole bunch of girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight (yeah)\nBetter wear your cape 'cause the bringin' that kryptonite (okay)\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (I know what you like, baby)\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\n(Yeah, we gon' take this to verse 2)\nNow some of them want a family, a sense of security (yeah)\nA necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelry\nSo shop 'til you drop, or 'til it makes you psychotic\nHere's a triple black card, it ain't trickin' if you got it (hey)\nOthers will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh\nSend 'em to the spa, get 'em massaged and bubble bathed\nSo later on they can dance and throw a drink in they hand\nAnd try every and anythin' they never did with they man, me\nSo get loose and slide off ya damn garments (hey)\nShow 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant\nThere's places on your body that I'm just tryin' to find\nSo in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind (woo!)\nAn I got plenty more to learn if you's investin' in me (okay)\nThey don't love for who I am but who I destined to be\nAnd for that, I'd give you everythin' up under the sun\n'Cause in the end all the girls just wanna have fun\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (I know what you feel, yeah)\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nThey wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen (yeah)\nIf you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen\n'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick\nGets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick\nI say they wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen (yeah)\nIf you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen\n'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick\nGets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sean Garrett & (Ludacris)]\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like (hahaha, yeah)\nI know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels\nAnd it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like (they wanna go on vacation and I know it, let's go)\nI know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls\nI know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like\nI know
