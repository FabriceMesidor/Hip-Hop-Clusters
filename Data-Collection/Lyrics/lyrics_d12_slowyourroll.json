don't want no beef\nYou ain't got no ends to justify the means\nYou don't got a cause, you better put it on pause\nYou don't got the balls to fit in them draws\nSo whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed\nYou better start rethinking and thinking it fast\nAin't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask\nYou better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Swift)\nAnd slow your roll\n\n[Verse 1: Swift]\nSinister, a menace to many, I'm not friendly\nYou get shot in a Kennedy fashion\nPop willingly you walking around with Pac's identity\nI'm a mockery you 'bout to watch what it's fin to be\nI'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked\nAnd it's not about dropping albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot\nYou can't help it but to imagine this walking massacre\nA madman strapped with a Magnum blow that spasm out ya back\nAnd just stand there and snatch your medallion\nSee I can't fear any nigga that can not happen\nThe immaculate Mac handler\nThat got this wrapping by the back of his neck\nA scavenger I'm a threat then you feel me\nLike a hand full of syringes\nI'm ill enough to scream at your front do'\nBlow it off the hinges (nigga)\nI'm marksmatic, depressed marksman outta walking\n'Cause soon your body they catch me shooting up your carcass\nSo don't provoke shit, I wish the whole\nMankind was a neck so I can choke it\nFerocious and you ain't gonna be knowing where ya folks is\nFuck the milk cartons and posters, it's over, they ghosts (hey)\n\n[Verse 2: Proof]\nNiggas is bitch instead of digging a ditch\nI'ma see how filled this river can get even bitches get hit\nI'm raw dog on all fours, I'm barking with long claws\nJust fight for the wrong cause\nYour boss with thong drawers (oh no)\nYou ain't in my bracket bitch, following faggots\nWith wanksta tats on their ass, see ya\n[Eminem backwards:] Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice\nThese scrubs need to do what he love and just play the back\nBefore I'll put a sword on ya head like a Raider cap\nYou bust I'm spraying back, leave your hood laying flat\nNow what you gonna say to that?\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYou don't got a reason and don't want no beef\nYou ain't got no ends to justify the means\nYou don't got a cause, you better put it on pause\nYou don't got the balls to fit in them draws\nSo whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed\nYou better start rethinking and thinking it fast\nAin't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask\nYou better pump them brakes and let off the gas (Bizarre)\nAnd slow your roll\n\n[Verse 3: Bizarre]\nPull up new county truck, throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up\nFuck butter I killed the DJ\nI don't need you, bitch, I got a instant replay\nLay down bitch get butt naked\nAnd fuck the Viagra I'm trying to nut in two seconds\nAll around the world, fuck wit' different cliques\nYou ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch\n\n[Verse 4: Kuniva]\nI'm calm but I steal on niggas like I was klepto\nPut that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro\nWhy stop niggas, why not pop niggas, we cop figures\nKeep them toast like IHOP nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert\nOr get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood T-shirt\nLet's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks\nI used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack\nI'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit\nA culprit of culture and a chaotic commotion\nKuniva will blow shit off of the map and post it\nKnock you out of your penny loafers, fuck that ho shit\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYou don't got a reason and don't want no beef\nYou ain't got no ends to justify the means\nYou don't got a cause, you better put it on pause\nYou don't got the balls to fit in them draws\nSo whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed\nYou better start rethinking and thinking it fast\nAin't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask\nYou better pump them brakes and let off the gas\nAnd slow your roll\n\n[Verse 5: Kon Artis]\nI point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me\nTo knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be\nOn your p's and q's people we sees to use\nNo one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives\nAnd put it in your little magazine, but you should\nKnow that was the most desperate thing that you could\nPull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much\nStart doing heroin lines for as much as you gossip\nLike bitches with Oscars, y'all actresses\n45's make bodies flip like flabby tits\nBullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th\nNow what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit?\nYour record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch\nDo the math, you'll never have a Shady/Aftermath Runyon Ave\nKind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up\nBefore we clap that ass up\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYou don't got a reason and don't want no beef\nYou ain't got no ends to justify the means\nYou don't got a cause, you better put it on pause\nYou don't got the balls to fit in them draws\nSo whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed\nYou better start rethinking and thinking it fast\nAin't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask\nYou better pump them brakes and let off the gas\nAnd slow your roll\n\n[Outro: Kon Artis]\nNigga you better ask somebody\nThese niggas think they can just put shit\nOut on their own, fuck them", "image":
