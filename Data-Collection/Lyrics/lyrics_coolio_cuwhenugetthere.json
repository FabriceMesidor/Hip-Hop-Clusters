Pookie - 40 Thevz]\nYou need to loosen up and live a little\nAnd if you got kids let them know how you feelin\nFor your own sake give a little\nOh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack\nAnd keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own\nThe realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest\nBut some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone\nCould have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us\nWe prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right\nWhen there's something involved that we desire\nSo hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous\nI know times seem strife, and problems seem endless\nBut at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together\nAnd if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it\nCause nothing worse than a quitter\nYou gotta face responsibility one day, my brother\nSo wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition\nAnd put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Coolio]\nAs we walk down the road of our destiny\nAnd the time comes to choose which shall it be\nThe wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow\nWe got one voice to give and one life to live\nStand up for something or lie down in your game\nListen to the song that we sing\nIt's up to you to make it big\nI guess I'll see you when you see me\n\n[Hook] - to fade", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b2afc0b2ec12b84597cab495ffdf0e1.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
