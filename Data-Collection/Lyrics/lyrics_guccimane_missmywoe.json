(so soon)\nWhy they gotta go so fast?\nThey don't make enough like you\nSo I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe\nGot money for bail, got money for bail\nI won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail\nThey want me to lose but they won't prevail\nDamn I miss my dog man he should be here\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nFresh outta jail, made bail for the tenth time\nShoulda been said something cause it's been time\nYou see me smiling but I'm crying on the inside\nThinking bout my homies locked down on the inside\nI've been spared so many times, could've been died\nCoulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried\nIt's so hard to understand when it's God's plan\nAnd it's not in my hands but in God's hands\nFree my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe\nAnd every soldier ten toes who ain't never told\nAnd free my nigga Slick Ralph and my Uncle Grant\nLord knows I'm asking for a lot but bring my niggas back\n\n[Chorus: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe\nAlways stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4\nI still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nAnd I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)\nWhy they always die so soon? (so soon)\nWhy they gotta go so fast?\nThey don't make enough like you\nSo I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe\nGot money for bail, got money for bail\nI won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail\nThey want me to lose but they won't prevail\nDamn I miss my dawg, man he should be here\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nNobody ever kept it real with me like Shawty Lo\nIn ATL, your memory will never let it go\nI'm holding on to them late nights in the studio\nAnd every call, every show, and every video\nR.I.P. to Slim Dunk, we miss you, Mario\nWe tryna move on but it still hurt though\nWe try to come together but it won't work though\n'Cause you's the most important piece to the puzzle\nI was in my cell, when I heard the news 'bout Bankroll\nNow everybody tryna be like Bankroll\nBut they broke the mold, when they made my nigga Bankroll\nI know I look like I'm all good but I ain't though\n\n[Chorus: Rico Love & Gucci Mane]\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missin' my woe\nAlways stay on 10 like the 6 and the 4\nI still can't believe you won't be hitting my phone\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nAnd I said one time, one time for the real ones (for the real ones)\nWhy they always die so soon? (so soon)\nWhy they gotta go so fast?\nThey don't make enough like you\nSo I took a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe, huh\nTook a shot of Dusse now I'm missing my woe\nMissing my woe, huh, missing my woe\nGot money for bail, got money for bail\nI won't stay in jail, I won't stay in jail\nThey want me to lose but they won't prevail\nDamn I miss my dawg, man he should be here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/534da4803c3535014a96c123eed6953a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
