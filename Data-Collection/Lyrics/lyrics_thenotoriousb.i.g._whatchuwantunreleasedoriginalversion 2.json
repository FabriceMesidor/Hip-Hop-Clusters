Harder than the Plymouth\nIt ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff\nAnd a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back\nSo what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?\nI hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die\nBrains all leaking out on the street\nAnd the pastor preaching \"He was a good man.\"\nPlayed the bad man when the burner was in his hand\nNow he's singing sad songs with Elvis\nThree to the head, bout six cross the pelvis\nYou fuck with the high guy, ya die\nYou the same motherfucker yelling \"Look up in the sky!\"\nI'm on some old neck shit\nSuplex shit, hardcore sex shit\nAnd TEC shit, whatchu want nigga?!\n\n[Hook: ???, The Notorious B.I.G, talking]\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga? (x8)\n(Poppin' that straight up, niggas really know)\n(True hardcore, fuck is wrong with you?)\n(Junior M.A.F.I.A)\n(OGB)\n(50 Grand, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nA repetitive loop\nAll I need to destroy a soloist or group\nHuh, I put it to ya boy\nHope you got the scoop\nBiggie Smalls, the rap genius\nI keep the Glock by the penis, the cleanest cut\nFuck the sluts with the big humongous butts\nHuh, I use a rubber, but\nMy style is gushy like the hooker's pussy\nAnd it don't take a lot of back talk to push me\nInto flamin' 'em, like that little nigga Damien\nPop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium\nGame tight, gun totin' motherfucker\nNiggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker\nI tricked 'em -- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em\nI stripped 'em, cause niggas don't want the friction\nTold you before how I bring the drama\nSlam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama\nWhatchu want nigga?!\n\n[Hook: ???]\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga? (x8)\n\n\n[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nFuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga\nWhen I get busy, throw your hands to the sky nigga\nI got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me\nKnowing that they'd rather be stabbing me\nAll up in my back, trying to take my track\nWhen I used to sell crack, I ain't have problems like that\nStreet rules, watch your pockets and your jewels\nA nigga front? Throw the gat to the fools\nTears don't effect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G\nDisrespect me? My potency is deadly\nOnce the venom hits the cerebellum\nMy lips get chapped, and my hards start swellin'\nKeep the nine millimeter by the Peter\nTo kill a motherfucker, don't a think feel sweeter\nOooohh, it make my head hurt, the blood spurt\nThe robbery expert's berserk\nWhatchu want nigga?!\n\n[Hook: ???]\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?\nWhatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97e6c354b8368e36130dd912210fd93d.1000x992x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
