sittin' on chrome\nMy nigga, Johnny J, studio full of mothafuckers\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\nThat's right\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nSomebody wake me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed, the semen\nSwimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'\nOn the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' \"stop\"\nFrom a single drop, this is what they got\nNot to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser\nOnly plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her\nEven as a little seed, I could see his plan for me\nStranded on welfare, another broken family\nNow what was I to be, the product of this heated passion\nMomma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass\nLook how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me\nPistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me\nHow can I survive?\nGot me askin' white Jesus \"will a nigga live or die?\"\n'Cause the Lord can't see us\nIn the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine\nNo sunny days and we only play sometimes\nWhen everybody's sleepin'\nI open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'\nI can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone\nI'm only 19, out tryin' to hustle on my own\nOn this block where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks\nI'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops\nDon't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn\nYou can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone\nYou can ask my man, he's a mind reader\nKeep my nine heater all the time, this is how we grind\nMeet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed, nigga\nThat Hennessy'll keep me keyed nigga\nEverywhere I go niggas holla at me, \"Keep it real, G\"\nAnd my reply: \"'til they kill me,\" act up if you feel me\nI was born not to make it but I did\nThe tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & Big Syke]\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\nAnd still I rise\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n\n[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]\nI stay sharp as always\nRunnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways\nDumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day\nSecrets of war prepare me for the worst\nA life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse\nBut now my dreams it seems though\nBe placin' triple beams and things, bro\nDiamond pinky ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans slow\n\n[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]\nDynamically this dude will twist your shit ceramically\nAble to write a Fatal verse with no profanity\nIt's on for Al G., Nikko Storm and Nasty New\nI put a hole in your crew, tryin' to pass me\nWith no remorse\nYou get blasted full force\nA Nike endorsement doin' shootings on a horse\nWorld wide supremacy\nAll y'all remember me\nHung over from Hennessy\nWith a menace intendency\nPolice be clockin' me\nSo I be dippin', slippin' sloppily\nSippin' Vodka, B\nAnd ditchin' clips on private property\nWhen five-O be comin'\nNiggas be runnin' for they life and freedom\nThe type to beat 'em\nHittin' gates and break and try to lead 'em\nTo pit terriers, Monclair gettin' scarier\nThey nine's, they shoot 'em in secluded areas\nThe barrier, not me\nI'm burned 'em off the dick, stayin' scot-free\n'Til Task harass my ass and try to have the ave locked D\nMy nigga fell\nGivin' a whole essence county trigger hell\nRunnin' the fuckin' block and duckin' cops tryin' to get a bail\n\n[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]\nIn '96 my Glock's my plastic passion for blastin' bastards\nNo faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards\nYa cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice\nI send my missiles through your mattress\nLeavin' holes in your body like a cactus\nWhile me and my crew be boppin', more greens the topic\nAnd loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'\nLeavin' ya spleen to pick up\nHalf of you niggas is softer than a Snicker\nLet's go to war and see who draw quicker\nAnd still I rise, and still I rise\nAnd still I rise, and still I rise\n\n[Outro: 2Pac, Big Syke & (a lil kid)]\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(No matter what you muthafuckas do to me)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(I'ma still come up)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(So fuck all y'all)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Y'all can't stop the real shit)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Little niggas tearin' shit up)\n(Y'all niggas respect it)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(All day every day)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Now I got rebels waitin')\n(B.I.G.)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Thought you knew)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(I'm out this bitch)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Come on, Pac)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Let's get, let's get the fuck outta here, Pac)\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(Got some hoes waitin' outside)\nWhat you say?\n'96 big body sittin' on chrome\n(I said we got some hoes waitin' outside)", "image":
