You gon' change on me?\nYou better take a good look, cause you ain't gon' see\nMy face... ever again\nI'll find a better hoe and you can get a better pimp\nBeotch!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Too $hort - over Chorus]\nIt's over baby!\nNothin\n\n[Too $hort]\nNow when I'm through wit'chu - ain't no gettin back\nI don't want money from you, and I don't care who's hittin that\nDon't speak when you see me and don't call a player\nYou can fuck a dog, for all I care bitch!\nIt ain't the same on your own\nI know you miss me, that's why you playin games on the phone\nI'm like Pimp C, I'm just not willing and able\nTo keep a bitch like you in my stable\nYou're nothin but trouble, you never could be on my level\nYou was turned off first time I said hello\nYou a freak and you fine but you weak in the mind\nAnd worst of all, you're cheap wit'cha grind\nYou don't earn enough, got me burnin up\nCause you ain't even willin, to learn new stuff\nGet the fuck out my face cause right now I will\nWhup your motherfuckin ass, bitch you know how I feel\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Too $hort - over Chorus]\nWhat bitch?\nI ain't tryin to hear that shit baby\nTime's up\nIt's too late\n\n[Outro]\nGet the fuck out my face bitch!\nIt's over baby, nuttin to talk about\nI fucks wit'chu no mo'\nIt's too late baby, ain't nuttin you can say\nI'm outta here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cbce7a2bf9547c73552eb8d05ea5f8b2.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
