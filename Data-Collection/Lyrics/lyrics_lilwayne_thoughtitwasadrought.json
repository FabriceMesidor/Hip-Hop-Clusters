You know what I mean, that's the nicest thing. I mean like, even if its clich\u00e9, clich\u00e9 I can still tell when that clich\u00e9 was straight from your heart and that's all you could think about, all you could think to say when you saw me or if you meant it, like even if it's that, like I said just when it's real. You know why? 'Cause sometimes people can say things that's so real to them that they don't even know that, you know what I mean, some of the things they are saying isn't fact, you know what I mean, official. But you know, things like so what I mean like example: you might walk up on somebody, I might walk up on somebody on the street and they might, uh, they might... shout out the valet from today, umm well yesterday, shout out the valet from yesterday, before you opened the door of my car, you're looking in my eyes, you're a young cat too, you look me in the eyes and you say ahh, and he couldn't, his English wasn't all that, he said: I like the new album, I really like the new project, and I said to him I was like thank you man, he meant that, 'cause he looked me in my eyes and he even opened my door before he said it, you know what I mean, so I was like damn you know when I got in the car I was like damn it's not a project. You know what I mean I don't even consider that, it's damn sure not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie. I slid him a nice little tip you know what I mean", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3622689a5172c789024942436b11dce2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
