Jackson\nYou throwing money, you ain't even own a crib yet\nYou ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet\nYou ain't send no money to your man doing bid yet\nBut you making it rain you a fucking lame\nY'all lames man\n\nI'm in the SRT with an ACP\nMy sneaks ACG put out an APB\nI make my bars go together like the ABC\nI'm the club throwing dubs sipping A-C-E, spado\nAin't talking Tony when we say that yayo\nIn the kitchen we Miracle Whipping like its mayo\nWe hit the block and hit the rock like Ay-o\nOn the grizzy my shooters with me call them O.J. Mayo, woah!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4ef9d44c0e1a01f0aeac265ee58874dd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
