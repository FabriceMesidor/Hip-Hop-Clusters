How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? How do you? How do you?\nHow do you? How do you?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou let me win, you let me ride\nYou let me rock, you let me slide\nAnd when they lookin', you let me hide\nDefend my honor, protect my pride\nThe good advice, I always hated\nBut lookin' back, it made me greater\nYou always told me, forget the haters\nJust get my money, just get my weight up\nKnow when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'\nIt's like you got it, down to a science\nWhy am I tryin'? No, you ain't buyin'\nI tried to fight it, back with defiance\nYou make me laugh, you make me hoarse\nFrom yellin' at you, and gettin' at you\nPickin up dishes, throwin' them at you\nWhy are you speakin', when no one asked you?\n\n[Hook]\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? How do you? How do you?\nHow do you? How do you?\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit? How do you? Do that\nHow do you? Do that\nHow do you? Do that\nHow do you? Do that\nHow do you? Do that\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat are we doin'? 'Cause you see through me\n'Cause you say \"Nicki,\" and I say \"Who me?\"\nAnd you say \"No you,\" and I say \"Screw you\"\nThen you start dressin', and you start leavin'\nAnd I start cryin', and I start screamin'\nThe heavy breathin', but what's the reason?\nAlways get the reaction you wanted\nI'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!\nAnswer this question, class is in session\nTired of lettin', passive aggression\nControl my mind, capture my soul\nOkay, you're right, just let it go\nOkay, you got it, it's in the can\nBefore I played it, you knew my hand\nYou could turn a free throw to a goal\nNigga got the peephole to my soul\n\n[Hook]\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? How do you? How do you?\nHow do you? How do you?\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit? How do you Do that?\nHow do you Do that?\nHow do you Do that?\nHow do you Do that?\nHow do you?\n\n[Bridge]\nSTOP! oooooh\nSTOP! oohhhh\nWould you just stop lookin through me, 'cause I can't take it\nNo, I can't take it\n\n[Hook]\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit? How do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? How do you? How do you?\nHow do you? How do you?\n\n[Outro]\nYou see right through me\nYou see right through me, baby\nYou see right through me (do that shit)\nYou see right through me (how do you do that shit?)\nHow do you do that? How do you do that?\nHow do you do that? How do you do that?\nHow you do that Baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/46fc1bf802589b4e0e09b7a9e210877c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
