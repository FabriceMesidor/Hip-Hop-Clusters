Make 'em remember us\nTen years plus, 10K's a new pair of rims for us\nCome and kick it with some niggas who don't empty guts\nThey broke so they envy us\nLaughin' to the bank while these suckers so serious\nYou ain't a boss, let me talk to your superior\nLeather interior, bet I don't marry her\nNew year, gearin' up for success in different areas\nNiggas was lost, switched the criteria\nHard not to stare at us\nThink she home, but she here with us\nGettin' that kush smoke in her hair and stuff\nThirty thousand feet in the air\nAlways been and will be prepared for any affair\nNo diamonds in my teeth but that's all I wear\nSolitaires by the pair, been ballin' my whole career\n\n[Chorus]\nBall 'til you fall\nDon't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all\nGotta stay hands on, heavily involved\nTry to handle your business and stay up out of ours\nThen your problem's solved\nBall 'til you fall\nDon't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all\nGotta stay hands on, heavily involved\nTry to handle your business and stay up out of ours\nThen your problem's solved", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25f75d9000a8f2a523b5c3528fe6759b.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
