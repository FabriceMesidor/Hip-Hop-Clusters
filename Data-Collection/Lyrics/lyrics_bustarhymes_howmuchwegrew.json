held it down with me through the whole shit\nFrom the beginning of the fort, to the now current day of the fort\nFrom the beginning and the birth of this whole shit\nTo the now success of this whole shit\nAnd all my peoples that be holdin' it down for their peoples\nRidin with them through thick and thin, love y'all niggas\nPeep it\n\n[Chorus]\n1, 2\nEvery time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas\n1, 2\nAll the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas\n1, 2\nEvery time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas\n1, 2\nAll the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, this how the shit all started\nWas like doctors of [?] I was being conceived kinda retarded\nLike, and while my moms was conceiving this beautiful baby\nDoctors was the this woman's stress out of this Jamaican lady\nPops beef and straight carrying on\nNobody realizing how the god was now being born\nAyo, yo, 1, 2\nWhile they was wildin' and shit\nThey couldn't even find my pulse, sonogram on the frisk\nSo, they tried a natural birth, but had to stop production\nBaby stuck all up in the womb, another malfunction\n1, 2\nAnd now the doctors discover\nThey had to cut this lady's gut, and c-section me out of my mother\nPop duke could only sit and ask why\nLooked up in the sky and begged for mercy from the most high\nC'mon, now, 1, 2\nSee now the day would feel blessed\nWatching the birth of a precious baby life manifest\nSee how that bugged me out\n\n[Chorus]\n1, 2 (That shit, that type shit be buggin me out 'cause)\nEvery time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Y'know niggas, nigga look back)\n1, 2 (To them days when you know shit is kinda ill like y'knawmean?)\nAll the things I do, you know I will

inquiring a lot, started using my dick\nLike I knew it all but I wasn't really knowin' and shit\nBuggin when my pubic hairs started growin' and shit\nNow hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass\nSearchin desperate to experience my first piece of ass\nNow, gettin' into mischief and caught my first arrest\nStarted smoking weed and started totin' on them cigarettes\nEyes bloodshot like I was starin' at a highbeam\nNigga only twelve so why he lookin' like he nineteen?\n1, 2\nThe fast life baby, young with an old soul\nFrom the past life baby\nA young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick\nAmbitious on the Amtrak, with a quarter brick\nMy nigga, 1, 2\nIt got hot in the streets\nMy nigga campaign the cops who started walkin' the beat, my nigga\nTrouble causin' too much problems just me and my brother\nMade mommy a grandma and shacked up with my babymother\nNow it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit\nStrugglin', so then I start fuckin 'round with this rap shit\nMoved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas\nBelievin we could show the world we was the Leaders Of the New niggas\nA crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary\nBlazin' 'til they started actin' like bitches internally\nSo now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho\nTried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more\nFo rilla, 1, 2\nAnd then I got with some niggas\nAlways wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas\nAnd then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms\nWhippin' Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms\nGive the local little old man a job as my chaeuffeur\nHold it down for all my niggas til the movement is over\nIt's kinda beautiful\n\n[Chorus]\n1, 2 (Yeah, y'knawmean?)\nEvery time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (How we have acquired so much)\n1, 2 (Where we can look back and, and actually laugh and lavish)\nAll the things I do, you know I will hold my flags for you my niggas (In the, in the, in the moment)\n1, 2 (As we prime in life)\nEvery time I sit and take a look at how we grew so much my niggas (Look at how we, we struggled all this way and went through the bullshit)\n1, 2 (Motherfuckin',
