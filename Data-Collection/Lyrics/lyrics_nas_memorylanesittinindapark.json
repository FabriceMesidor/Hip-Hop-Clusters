Watch the herbs stand still\nNever talkin' to snakes, 'cause the words of man kill\nTrue in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein\nI pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Now let me take a trip down memory lane\"\n\"Comin' outta Queensbridge\"\n\"Now let me take a trip down memory lane\"\n\"Comin' outta Queensbridge\"\n\n[Outro: DJ Premier scratching]\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"The most dangerous MC is\u2026\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"The most dangerous MC is\u2026\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"The most dangerous MC is\u2026\"\n\"Comin' out of Queensbridge\"\n\"The most dangerous MC is\u2026\"\n\"Me number one, and you know where me from\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8753de258796b1f91adfedde591e85be.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
