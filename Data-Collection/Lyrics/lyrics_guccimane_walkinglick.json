Holiday!\nThat's 185 right there\nYo Gucc! I know you got like ten birds when we walk in the club nigga\nYou know what it is, Trap Back baby! The streets is hungry\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nEighty grand in my Robin jeans\nIt's hot outside, but I'm coolin' it\nTop on down but I'm losing it\nMind gone with a foreign chick\nWith a Tech-9 with a cooling kit\nGot the black jeans with the wings on 'em\nGucci shoes, no shoe-strings\nShit, every word means two things\nSo the white girl is my boo thang\nAnd I'll come in due time, in the drop head at the blue flame\nAnd I don't like to see no new faces\nCause I don't like to learn no new names\nI go to sleep in foreign places\nWake up, count big faces\nStuff cash in suitcases, pillowcases, I'm two-faced\n\n[Chorus: Gucci Mane]\nI'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nMillionaire with Trues on in a stash house with shoes on\nPut a million dollars in my new home\nAnd a quarter million in my trap house\nPut a half a mil' in your bank account\nNigga, serve dope in my zone\nCooking the work with no gloves on\nSo the junkies can get they grub on\nI'm a OG with capital letters\nOn Capital Ave. with white leathers\nIn a '68 Camaro, no top on, I'm put together\nI got salt and pepper, no Spindarella\nStupid cheese, that's Mozerella\nBust 'em open, put 'em back together\nThen sell them to you, ahead of schedule\n\n[Chorus: Gucci Mane]\nI'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\n\n[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]\nI heard a price tag on my head! (Flocka!)\nI'm a walking lick!\nNigga, come and try, you gon end up dead bitch\nI'm out here roadkill, my niggas they so for real\nTwenty minutes from my hood, I don't need no house on the hill!\nReachin for my tech, your mama better write your will\nShit gon' get ugly, my youngins pop about two pills\nWhere them niggas before and with this record deal\nMe and Gucci Mane, bitch, we hard to kill\n\n[Chorus: Gucci Mane]\nI'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)\nI-I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, talking shit\n(W-walking lick, I'm a talking brick, t-talking shit)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acd9babb757092a69a2f3c9e7eb4a9ad.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
