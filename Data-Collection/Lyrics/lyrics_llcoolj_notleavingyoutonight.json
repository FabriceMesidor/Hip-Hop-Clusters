I ain't having it, baby\nThey can all go to hell, I know they calling me crazy\nBut you're my sunshine when the world gets shady\nA toast to the first lady\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (You shouldn't be alone) alone (Nah)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nLove, you know, I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight\n(Fitz and the Tantrums, huh?)\nGo away, baby (That's right)\nI'm not leaving you tonight\nGo away, baby (Uh, uh)\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n(Farmer's Boulevard)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nTurn your back on it, and the sun still shines\nGrapes get old, and they turn into wine\nThe deeper the roots, the stronger the vines\nThese lines on my face just a sign of the times\nYou could cry on my shoulder if you're so inclined\nI used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line\nNow there's more important things occupying my mind\nLike being there for you, breathing the air for you\nDo trust falls and truth or dare for you\nThe weight of the world, I'm prepared to bear for you\nThe haters get cynical and call you spoiled\nNot knowing about the drama in which you embroiled\nThe numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil\nBut farmers taught me to put seeds in the soil\nAnd here comes the harvest; this part's the hardest\nI'm still here regardless\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo away, (Yeah) baby\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)\nGo away, baby\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n[Bridge: Eddie Van Halen (LL Cool J)]\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n(When I'm alone in my room, sometimes, I stare at the wall)\n(And, in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call)\n\n[Hook: Fitz & The Tantrums (LL Cool J)]\nYou shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone\nI'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)\nLove, you know, (Uh, uh) I'm right here\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Nah, nah)\nGo away, (Yeah) baby\nI'm not leaving you tonight (Uh)\nGo away, baby\nI'm not leaving you, not leaving you tonight\n\n[Outro: LL Cool J]\nFarmer's Boulevard\nQueens", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c0c7dbb9fd10ac4887ec94389a4d0712.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
