It's the big boss\nNew kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)\nTwo stars, hold your applause\nI hold it down he holds all guitars\nHalf my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight\nNew chicks, get my drinks up\nEvery weekend we can link up\nNew rings, with the pink cuts\nYou'll need a passport, get your Minks up\nTook my turn she love it, each touch\nAnd when she closes her eyes this what she thinks of, Boss\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world, welcome to the world", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57fc91d7548f4e591a971ea7f5443a88.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
