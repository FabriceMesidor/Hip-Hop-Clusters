(What!) Get your paper\nRight! (Yeah!)\nGet your money up! (What!) Get your paper\nRight! (Yeah!)\nGet your money up! (What!) Get your paper\nRight! (Yeah!)\nAnd watch a nigga do his thing for real\nAIGHT?\n\n[DMX]\nBack on the grind, back on the clock\nComin back for mine, back on the block\nThe kid is, back with the Glock to stick niggas up\nHear that meat wagon, come pick niggas up\nWhat nigga, WHAT? You keep a dick in yo' mouth\nI'm from New York, but I'm STILL the shit in the South\nMotherfuckers don't wan' know about the Dog\nAnd I ain't got no friend for, all of y'all\nLook, shit now here gon' change nigga, for real!\nRed dot on yo' brain nigga, for real!\nI ain't got time for the bullshit\nY'all niggas is mutts, I'm a full Pit on my way to the pulpit\n\n[Hook 2X: DMX]\nGet your money up!
