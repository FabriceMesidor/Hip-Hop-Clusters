hands on ya, hands on ya\nTime to roll with the secrets now\nSecrets of war\nPut your hands on ya, hands on ya\nPeep it\nCheck it\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nMy melody is music that's corrupt as a felony\nLethal weapon rebelling, so dope that niggas inhaling me, uh!\nLike Sun Tzu or Machiavelli, the secrets of war\nThe art of combat, bustin' will never fail me\nNow Rule 1: Follow yo' enemies and peep his weakness\nConstitute while he's asleep and make the game deeper\nRule 2: Locate his crew, and peep the things they do\nNow get some infra-red beams and waste them niggas too\nRule 3: Let's find a place where they rest they head\nYou jealous bastards make caskets out ya comfy beds\nRule 4: Now peep the secrets of war\nI got surveillance on muthafuckas beware of my forty-four\nRule 5: Right before you bustas die\nLet you look me inside my eyes say ya good-byees\nThen Rule 6: Witness the death of a trick\nHe was a coward from day one, and died like a bitch, see BIIATCH\nHahahahahaha\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nWe bust, if we must, plus we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\n(you know what time it is)\nSecrets of war\nWe bust if we must, plus we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\n(Put your hands on ya, hands on ya)\nSecrets of war\n\n[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]\nI diffuse troops with interviews and they metabolism\nSure mad and I'm snappin on rappers actin' they stacks is wit' 'em\nExpose you like spades, who the fuck out they heart\nI pull your projects apart and find more ism than narcs\nWe play parks and side streets, keepin' it 9 to 5 B\nLast week plan is jump to 21 jump street\nPoisonous led, spread ya legs on the rake\nOr I'm gettin' mine feel about 29 that's sittin' on the ledge\nThis ain't the place to creep, so don't be practicin'\nHow to get my niggas on the block, when you think we sleep\nNo I don't think ya know our styles, you ain't got shit I wreck\nMechanic will have 'em empty like them 7th ave projects\nYou half way crooks, ya guys are scared to step foot and look fast\nOn the strength they can get hit up quick or their shit took fast\nI smile, and I'll commitin' murder, money live\nPager 325, on some shit you never fuckin' heard of\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nHere we go, secrets of war\nWe bust if we must, plus, we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\nSecrets of war (y'all know what time it is)\nWe bust if we must, plus, we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\n(Put your hands on ya, hands on ya)\n\n[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]\nNowadays with all these fast cash tendencies\nYo straight up, they got me lookin' eye to eye, with all my enemies\nSpottin' almost plottin', claimin' to be a fuckin' friend of me\nTriple connections, Two TECs sittin' shot gun up in the Lexus\nReady to release some ripples in a nigga mid-section\nWith bullets that's hollow, rules to follow crews get swallowed down wit' the clowns\nGet drowned like deuce deuce bottles\nWe clique gettin' major, clappin' glasses, spittin' razors\nIt's insane how I live, it's unexplained cross behavior\nStreets of war\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nWe bust if we must, plus, we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\nSecrets of war (y'all know what time it is)\nWe bust if we must, plus, we handle business\nIf you jealous niggas fuck with us\n(Hands on ya, hands on ya)\n\n[Verse 4: Kurupt]\nI've seen it over, and over, no win sit-yay-tions\nThe end, the end of gladiations so now they facin' (uh)\nThey faced with metaphoric phrases hysteria (uh huh)\nEngages the death toll to spread like malaria\nWhat I can cock and stop thoughts from circulatin' through ya head\nIn the form of writer's block and spread like a plague (hm)\nI break, batter and bruise neck, arms and legs\nIn my profession, my thoughts conceal weapons (uhh)\nGettin' ready to drop the bomb like the B-1\nYa 145 pound rhymes and mines a 3 ton\nConcoctions, mystic can spot the gator\nBefore ya get a dosage of the greatest rhyme creator\nIn this existence relax and explore the scene\nI get this shit pumped the fuck up like morphine\nAnd uh, and uh, and uh\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nHahahahehehehe, be-itch\nSecrets of muthafuckin' war\n(We bust, if we must, plus, jealous niggas fuck wit' us)\nY'all don't even understand it\n(secrets of war, we bust if we must, plus, jealous niggas fuck wit' us)\nSecrets of war\nAnd all you lil' young ass souljahs\nYou play this shit back about 50 times\nYou'll have enough game to roll up to the club or somethin' (we thuggin' be-itch)\nTeach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?\nSecrets of muthafuckin' war, live on Death Row, BITCH!\nHahahahahehehehehe\nYou niggas crazy\nWell that was Kurupt\nFatal, Felony\nAnd 'Pac\nThat nigga Johnny J on the beat so\nYou know it's thug life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
