I met this girl the other night\nHype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight\nTalkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips\nHad to cross my legs just to look at her tits\nSaid she came out lookin' for some fun\nLooked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one\nI said \"Why?\", she said I was fly\nGrabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die\nSaid she wanted to take me home to make love\nNow that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of\nI said, \"Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?\"\nShe said, \"All the above\"\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\n\n[Verse Two]\nNow, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip\nBut let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip\nTook me to her crib that night, leather and spikes\nBroke out the rope and the dope strobe-light\nAnd started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room\nThen she did a backflip, landed on my dick\nI knew that I would be dead soon\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a bomb or a gun\nThis girl tried to kill me\nHomeboys, watch out for this one\n\n[Verse Three]\nYo, my pants were on, but so what?\nShe ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up\nFaster than I could say \"No!\"\nIt was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut\nI looked in her face...\nShe sweated and she grinned with delight\nAnd then she broke out a whip, I said \"Shit!\"\nThis girl had crazy plans for the night\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a bomb or a gun\nThis girl tried to kill me\nHomeboys watch out for this one\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\n\n[Verse Four]\nNow whips ain't all that she had\nAll kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad\nI'm talking about latex suits, spike-heeled boots\nOversized vibrators so that she could get loose\nI said, \"Don't...don't...don't whip me!\nI'll do anything you ask!\"\nAnd then homegirl stripped, 38\" tits\nMan you shoulda seen that ass\n\n[Hook]\nThis girl tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a gun or a knife\nThis girl tried to kill me\nTook me within a inch of my life\nThis freak tried to kill me\nShe didn't use a bomb or a gun\nThis girl tried to kill me\nHomeboys, watch out for this one\n\n[Verse Five]\nMy dick was harder than a bulletproof vest\nShe started pourin' baby oil on her chest\nAnd then she said, \"Gimme gimme gimme\"\nJumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West\nI almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in\nIt was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten\nI knew my life would soon end\n\n[Hook/Outro]\nHomeboy tried to kill me\nHe didn't use a bomb or a gun\nHomeboy tried to kill me\nYo...yo, nowhere to run\nHomeboy tried to kill me\nHe didn't use a gun or a knife\nHomeboy tried to kill me\nCause he had caught me fuckin' his wife\nYo...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8130dc496c2cedd8004532bb340c7c91.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
