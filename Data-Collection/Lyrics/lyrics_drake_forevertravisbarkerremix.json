This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk, check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover\nShhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas\nNo brake pads, no such thing as last, uh\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nThere they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow\nNuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow\nFuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no\nHe ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nThey been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before\nBashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes\nThe passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot\nYou dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths\nNow rewind it\nPay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?\nWhen I slap the taste outta your mouth\nWith the bass so loud that it shakes the place\nI'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place\nSo Drake\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8e4af9d70633a1703ccd3faf671871c.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
