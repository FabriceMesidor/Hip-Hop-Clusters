This music is the end to the war\nWe endure, cameras everywhere, everyone is keeping score\nEverybody talkin bout what's up bout the tour\nThe world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw\nWe're back in heavy metal like we above the law\nLondon, Japan, Germany and France\nLisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands\nJump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance\nYou only live once, come on, here's your chance\nYou could be reborn, half star, half man\nIf you rise up and grab my hand\nIf I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime\nIf I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Brigde, Guitar Solo: Eddie Van Halen]\nEddie Van Halen\nWe are the greatest\nRise up!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c0c7dbb9fd10ac4887ec94389a4d0712.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
