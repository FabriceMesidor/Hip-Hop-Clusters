I bring trouble where, you sleep\nSo I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat\nAntidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo\nMC's dosey doe your mics up in this rodeo\nMy star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions\nShuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings\nFunk Doc to the spot freeze\nCreepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues\nDef Squad representer\nHit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter\n\n[Verse 3: Keith Murray]\nHey yo once a crack head, always a tack head\nYou have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead\nAs sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality\nY'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray\nI'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously\nNiggas ain't shit to me (word up)\nYou stupid niggas always got somethin smart to say\nAnd probably can't even spell TWA\nMy crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)\nJump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)\nNiggas is pussy and ways and actions show it\nPlus y'all niggas dead, and don't even know it\nAnd Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)\nAct trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife\n\n[Interlude: Announcer]\nAiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G\nRedman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad\nNext up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell\nFirst up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout\nLord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous\nBusta Rhymes\n\n[Verse 4: Rampage]\nTwo one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC\nWhen I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P\nNiggas and bitches be eyein me\nI'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame\nBecause I'm dangerous\nI'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble\nChickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile *beeping*\nI'm great distance like AT&T\nI stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee\nYo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G\nWhip a nigga ass for free\nAnd makin sure he see visions of me\nRampage the talk of the town\nThe stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)\nI'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers\nAsk Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors\nMy technique I freak seven days a week\nI'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap\nI'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert\nThose who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)\nA hundred percent, I gets down what I invent\nRap artists be dying to a certain extent\nSometimes they use the underground to make a comeback\nThat shit is wack, fade away and never come back\n\n[Verse 5: Lord Have Mercy]\nFor now and forever, it's the, evil that men do\nMental, my inner center Winter\nFrosted froze crews inventor, inventor\nInvader, evacuate I collapse your major\nStraights and loose minds\nYou're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers\nMy maneuvers, drop like lugers\nIllegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's\nSplittin blessings, with three Weapons\nLay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six\nFor you mindless, niggas I smack spineless\nOr lay back like recliners, as inject jewels\nAs flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh\nCorrupt your minors, like New York City's finest\nLineups, on LSD fine dust, in your sinus\nCrush like chinas, opiuMC grinders\nMy dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners\nThe infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful\nPapers stay viscous like religious cults\nLeaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters\nMy Flipmode niggas, we're like Afghanistan guerillas\n\n[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]\nIf you want more information look listen and read\nWhile I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed\nWe about to take control of your set like cruise control speed\nSatisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed\nMental slave grip on your brain like white people\nMy music will dominate the population like black people\nUtilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts\nI capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts\nHold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts\nFor sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts\nLet's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress\nBounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits\nHere we go again, another phenomenon when I get on\nBusta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong\nWe represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season\nFlipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons\nChaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down\nTill they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down\nAlcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin\nRaw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggas groovin\nI don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin\nYou're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin\nFrom your conversation the way you come across your shit is off\nMalfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force\nLay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross\nExotic niggas blastin off to the Land of the Lost\nIf you can't see this\nI recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller\nBig ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas\nRedman and the Rockafellas\nBig ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers\nBut still we travel the world like National Lampoon\nIt's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!\nHahahahahahahahah\nFlipmode COMPLETELY getting inside that ass\nDef Squad, respek", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8769bd52f12b0c4930edbc0a93c9cca.1000x973x1.jpg"}],
