Bite me, sweetheart\nI'm slightly retarded, but tonight I'm startin'\nShit, I'm feeling self righteous and might just hop in a mosh pit\nOn some Mike Tyson and Pac shit\nLookin' to box with anybody, disorderly conduct\nI'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith\nFan of The LOX, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock\nFrantic, I'm trapped in a closet\nPanic attack 'cause I'm claustrophobic\nNo, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver for movement\n'Cause I have no room for improvement\nI'm practically squashed, compacted and boxed in\nToxic, cans of arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content\nBar exam, start of insanity\nCharles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson\nAnimal snarls, cannibal jaws\nShark mandibles, lambs to the slaughter\nLooking skantless as Hannibal's stalking\nAnthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets\n(Whistle) Black out, Zach Galifianakis\nGallons of Vodka, but that gal has some knockers\nI bet'cha they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious\nWhat happened, doc? I passed out again\nAlcohol's making me break into vacant's naked\nStolen Magnavox and bag of rocks in back of a Datsun\nFell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics\nToo close to the StairMaster\nPoked a hole in the air mattress and popped it\nWoke up shortly thereafter, hungover\nNo underwear, grasping a Bayer Aspirin and dropped it\nAir Maxes in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich\nAnd the cross stitching is a cross mixing\nOf a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin\nFin, cotton Dockers, OshKoshes, drop crotches\nSwatch watches and sneakers match with the parkas\nBut it's like being overstaffed at a boxing gym\nWith all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers\nAnd I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted\nLike paper you write raps on, obnoxious\nYo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?\nFuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle a mall\nI\u2019ll stand there and yell that at a wall\n'Til the mannequin dolls scatter and the inanimate objects\nThat I'm battering all shatter and fall\n'Cause I hear the track and I'm starting to get fucking amped\nI'm a spark plug, I'm like the car with the cables\nHooked up to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell\nBut I sure as hell got it backwards 'cause y'all get jumped\nAnd I'll catch the battery charge, but\nI got a hunch like your back when it's arching\nWhen I start attacking your squadron\nYou'll feel like MasterCard when I'm charging\nSo take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you\nLike Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers\nSo get the sack like Wisconsin\nThat's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?\nYou faggots are all gonna do my bidding\nDon't get dragged to the auction\nNeiman Marcus, bags of Vuitton and all\nI'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this\nStretched, tinted, black sedan my ass\nSee how mad you act when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave\nIn a fucking taxi cab to go shopping\nAffable guy next door's laughable\nMy next whore's gonna have mechanical arms\nThat'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor\nNo emotion, hence I guess this sick prick dies hard\nI got a Magic Johnson\nIt's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me\nIf Ronda Rousey was on the couch with the condoms out\nHolding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me\nI laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me\nHer flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around\nAnd all I see is Paulie Malignaggi, she Slaughterhouse in a blouse\nAnd Madonna with mud on her, God dammit I am a misogynist\nI slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony\nJust so happens she's fond of algae\n'Cause now she faceplants on the concrete\nComplete lack of responsibility\nHalf you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit\nShit, you fags couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop\nBut I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy\nKlepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now\nFive-finger discount\nBeen rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy\nKidnapping your mom 'cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery\nRansom for JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, and Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit\n(\"Em\") Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde\nI might relapse, get on some bullshit\nPerhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson\nMacklemore, Mac Miller and Asher Roth\nAnd have some back and forths\nAnd record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's \"Control\" verse\nAnd perform \"Fack\" in concert [\"Fack\" plays]\nYo, I put that shit on a greatest hits album\nNow that was awesome\nIt takes some massive balls to do some shit like that\nSometimes I have to ponder why people are like (I'll stick around)\nAnd put up with my crap so long for, what's the attraction, mama?\nIs it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre\nOr the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?\nWho knows at this point, it's always poking so na-ah\nStill get along with this voice 'cause that's the \"Monster\"\nSo do-si-do with the (na-ah) sociopath\nEveryone who knows me knows that\nWhat they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio\n(Na-ah) She loves the way I lie\nSits on my face and waits for my nose to grow\nPathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole\nThat my disguise is pants, but they on fire\nSo am I-a, (Wu) Cappadonna, cut the track off\nSabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking\nI'm wrapping up all the presents\nIn fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em\nJack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off\nWrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him\nBlowing a head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond\nPut the basket back all the bath salt packets are gone, I\nKnow you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier\nBut classic rock acid rap is the genre\nGot Slash on guitar, splash of Bizarre, Thrasher, and Aerosmith\nAnd I'm a spectacular archer, feed Count Dracula, Chocula\nGodzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan, bandwagoners\nI'm kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em\nSmack Kim Basinger on her ass in the sauna", "image":
