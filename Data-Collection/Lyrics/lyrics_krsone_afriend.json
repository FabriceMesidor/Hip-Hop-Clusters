Uh!\nI send this one out, to my right hand man\nOr mens, or womens, the whole crew\nThe real fam\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can count the dough or kick a flow\nOr chill out watchin videos\nOr actin really silly yo but really though\nAll that can end\nWhether at the bar with superstars\nOr cruisin' in the trooper car\nI really don't care who you are\nAll I really need is a friend\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf we can't have trust, then you can't hang with us\nWe respond to those who show respect with respect\nWe respond, we connect on the same deck\nSame intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly\nIf you can't understand, we boys, we boys\nWe could stand on the corner with a hat sellin' toys\nIt ain't about your Benz, I hope it ain't about mine\nMy man, I be dissin' in my freestyle rhyme\nGettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl\nMy man, we chillin' at the jam, what's the plan?\nI'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men\nOr women, I'm drivin', I see my peeps yo get in\nWhere you fit in? True friends are quick to sit\nIn the beginning of all trouble, and when your bankroll doubles\nFred Flintstone and Barney Rubble\nStill I got my own space like Hubble\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can count the dough or kick a flow\nOr chill out watchin videos\nOr actin really silly yo but really though\nAll that can end\nWhether at the bar with superstars\nOr cruisin' in the trooper car\nI really don't care who you are\nAll I really need is a friend\n\n[Verse 2]\nCause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us\nUntil we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us\nAnd wanna shout us, but you my man from way back\nI just gots to say that, actin large I don't play that\nBut I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced\nA friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced\nAnd that's a disgrace there ain't nothing you can say to us\nWhen the kid you grew up with betrays your trust\nWhen we used to ride the bus we had trust\nNow we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us\nYo the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get\nWhat they can get, sit quickly backstabbin the click\nI roll thick, but only some are friends really\nDown to the end, my right hand men and women\nMutual support, from the beginning\nBeen in, exactly what I've been in\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can count the dough or kick a flow\nOr chill out watchin videos\nOr actin really silly yo but really doe\nAll that can end...\nWhether at the bar with superstars\nOr cruisin in the trooper car\nI really don't care who you are\nAll I really need is a friend\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack to back we attack corporate America\nGettin fees that amount to G's in every area\nYou my man I ain't gotta drag you along\nYou pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin on\nI don't see nothin wrong wit a little bumpin car system\nThumpin, between the crew we always got sump'un\nBut if we had nuttin no frontin whatever\nWe'd still be crew you and me, me for you together\nWord, fake people ain't worth a turd\nThey only want to be your friend because of what they overheard\nI send this record to the well respected\nFriends that I've collected, I hope I am what you expected\nYeah, so check it, so check it\n\n[Chorus]\nWe can count the dough or kick a flow\nOr chill out watchin videos\nOr actin really silly yo but really doe\nAll that can end...\nWhether at the bar with superstars\nOr cruisin in the trooper car\nI really don't care who you are\nAll I really need is a friend", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d8a06de1f39a224dcb05e3e9195e0b4.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
