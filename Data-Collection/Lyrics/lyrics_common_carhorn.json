Well boy hear me again\nOfficial raw nigga from the City of Winds\nStraight doing it, doing it, I am doing it\n(Repeat x2)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat the fuck is going down? Nigga you sound\nLike a real bitch right now, the pound\nI gave you I knew I shouldn't have gave you\nBefore you was a ho now you think the money made you\nA slave to the rhythm, indentured servant of wisdom\nClinton is the pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm\nIn a poetical prison, I'm visiting self\nFor hours, coward niggas get shanked for kicking\nPussy raps, radio is like CO's they try to push me back\nI rip cats out of they suits, give them they hoodies back\nI'm from the hood we stack, black fist\n\"Ooh ohh ahh\" is the sound of blackness\nThese new school cats is classless, influenced by rap shit\nFront money, but hustle backwards\nI break bread with broads that got they masters and hypes the blaster\nLawyers that work faster and young ghetto bastards\nBecame childlike with the way I style right\nAnd act, because children naturally react\nRespond to the Com as a poet I'm a last like a Don\nCause I'm like that yo, a phenom without shit on my arm\nYou can't coherse a verse\nI'm a rhyme when I want to get up and rhyme\nSome say I'm spaced like John Glenn cause of the places I've been\nI embrace the vibe, spin, been through cases of Heinekin\nReturn to orbit on some shit that's anti-corporate in a Wild Style\nOrchard gay rappers is getting tortured for tossing salads\nYou imbalanced, you rap about violence too much\nI go on blind dates with mind states and go dutch\nAt my shows the law show up, they be thinking it's a hold up\nSo many hands go up, but with the band I'm colder\nMoney folder, you want a fresh style let me show you\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a29c46801eb2394548c7fff0b090c0ef.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
