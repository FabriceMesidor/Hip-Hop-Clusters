bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret\nI rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus\nIn a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis\nMy actions are one with the seasons\nA TEC squeezing executioner\nWinter time I rock a fur\nMega popular center of attraction\nClimaxing, my bitches, they be laughing\nThey high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson\nCity lights spark a New York night\nRossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini\nFlipping mad pies, low price\nI blow dice and throw them\n.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan\nMy niggas roll in ten M3's\nTwenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasakis\nHip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll\nBlanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold\nI don't stunt, I regulate\nHenny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate\nI'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex\nIsraelite books, holding government names from Ness\nEmcees are crawling out every hole in the slum\nYou be a'ight like blood money in a pimp's cum\n\n[Chorus]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Verse 2]\nCurrency is made in the trust of the Messiah\nI'm spending it to get higher\nEarth, Wind and Fire singing Reasons why I'm\nUp early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early\nSunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves\nPut my hat on my waves, latter Day Saints say religious praise\nI dolo, challenge any team or solo\nYou must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough\nAsk around who's laid up, sharp and straight up\nMafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up\nSkies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy\nI'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily\nThis be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma\nIn a sentence, paragraph's indented\nBloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye\nOpening cigars let tobacco fly\nCondos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof\nShitting like gin and prune juice\nYo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high\nCourtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I\nJust wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years\nIn the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia\nFor wearing chrome, I told the judge snakes slither\nLike Sharon Stone but like Capone I'm thrown, yo\n\n[Chorus]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nFor you wack MC's\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation\nDime sack lacing, court pen pacing\nIndividual, lyrical math abrasion\nPsychic evaluation, the foulest nation\nWe living in dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives\nA lifestyle on bad streets is patternized\nWise men build and destroy\nWhile the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy\nCoke suppliers acting biased\n'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars\nBut every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired\nI still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani's\nJust a killer in me, slash drug dealer MC\nEx-slug filler, semi mug peeler\nDemi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow\nPut poetry inside a crack pot and blow\nRough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes\nBring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those\nWhy shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it\nMy degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses\nAnd studded-up, thick medallions\nRich niggas transport in thousands\nForeign cash exchange amounting to millions\nDoors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings\nTrick bitches catching mad feelings\nPeeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling\nI bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch\nWhen we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word\nSo now it's on, never wasted a slug\nTime is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood\n\n[Chorus]\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nFor you wack MC's\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nI made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that\nFor you wack MC's\n\n[Outro]\nYea, Capone-n-Noreaga\nYeah yo offical Queensbridge murderers\nMobb Deep keep it real though\nMotherfucking AZ yo\nMega, Mega, whatever\nScarlett O'Hara, Fox Boogie\nEast New York\nYambo, Brownsville\nWizard, Far Rockaway\nBig Bow, Jersey\nConnecticut, DC, Sudan\nVA, NC, LA\nSo on and so on\nBig Ha, Houston Fifth Ward\nBlack Ed, keep it real Moe", "image":
