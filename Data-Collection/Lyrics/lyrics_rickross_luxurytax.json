Yayo! He wanna sniff the yayo\nFlyin' saucer on the hasa, in the casa just to lay low\nMake more money man, that's the motto for the mob\nNeed a blow-job, my motto, get a model for the job\nGo hard, no job, hustler, no prob\nPost up, nigga what? Finger-fuck your whole squad\nForty round extend-o, flip it for my kinfolk\nLuxury tax on them packs, if you didn't know\nBought a new crib, niggas feelin' like I hid\n3.2, but I did it for the kids\nMore guns than a pawnshop\nGot my whole arm rocked\nKeep the 760 double-parked in the wrong spot\nStill hustlin', boss\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, you gotta pay for this\nI remember when I used to pray for this\nThis, this is classic, some shit you might not see again\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we ain't tryna see the Pen\nLike a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'\nThis is a luxury tax\n\n[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]\nYeah, imagine this, no, imagine that\nGave me my sack, like \"Good luck getting back\"\nI'm like, \"The fuck I'm gon' hide it at?\"\nAnd if I'm not careful, be the same place they find it at\nAnd I'm a winner, if I make it across the finish line\nPuttin' food on the table like it's dinner time\nAnd this is what you call stereotyping by far\nCan you tell me my your dog keep sniffin' my car?\nGot the audacity to call me a liar\nSo what you got in your trunk?\nOh, just a spare tire\nYou niggas talked blow, while I sold mine\nLike a bad cramp, it's lockin' up in no time\nMore time in the kitchen than I spent in the studio\n\"Gangsta's Paradise\", and I ain't talkin' 'bout Coolio\nCan't lie, still addicted to the odour\nGot a ice cold Pepsi, still thinkin' Coca-Cola\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, you gotta pay for this\nI remember when I used to pray for this\nThis, this is classic, some shit you might not see again\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we ain't tryna see the Pen\nLike a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'\nThis is a luxury tax\n\n[Verse 4: Trick Daddy]\nI'm up early in the morning and I'm dressed in black\nHold on, every morning I get dressed in black\nWhile y'all half-ass, nigga my pants saggin'\nI'm gettin' money and my swag, black-flaggin'\nMillion dollar status, fully automatic\nHeavy on the Henny, even harder on the women\nIf it wasn't for Reverend, I'd probably be pimpin' and shit\nPops, my papi, is already in me\nI tried trappin', shit sent me to prison\nGot mad and went to snappin', so homicide came to visit\nI smell gun powder, so you got one hour\nTo come up with every damn dollar; or you're done, dollar\nIt costs to ball, dog\nEspecially when the players on your team consider you as the ball hog\nYou treat me like Shaq, and you Kobe\nBut I ain't say you owe me, nigga\nBut act like you know me, nigga\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, you gotta pay for this\nI remember when I used to pray for this\nThis, this is classic, some shit you might not see again\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we taxin', you don't want it, nigga, leave it then\nAnd we ain't tryna see the Pen\nLike a needle in a haystack, we ain't tryna see the 'pin'\nThis is a luxury tax", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f8b2e81ca63aac9b6abc1db39b51d092.520x516x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
