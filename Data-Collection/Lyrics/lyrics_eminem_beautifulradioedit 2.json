Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h\nThey can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor\nEverything is so tense and gloom I\nAlmost feel like I gotta check the temperature at a room\nJust as soon\nAs I walk in\nIt's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact\nCause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that\nI'm not looking for extra attention\nI just want to be just like you\nBlend in with the rest of the room\nMaybe just point me to the closest restroom\nI don't need no... manservant\nFollow me around, and wipe my (instrumental)\nLaugh at every single joke I crack\nAnd half of 'em ain't even funny like\nHaah Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian\nG--damn\nUnfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown\nSo why don't you all sit down\nListen to the tale I'm about to tell\nHell, we don't have to trade our shoes\nAnd you don't have to walk no thousand miles\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's be like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what I'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at it through each other's eyes\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h\nThey can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, o-o-o-o-h\nThey can all get..... Just stay true to you, so-o-o-o-oh\n\nOutro:\nLately I've been hard to reach\nI've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world\nWhere they can be alone\nAre you calling me, are you trying to get through\nAre you reaching out for me, then I'm reaching out for you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76d1c320b997b2ae7b6174b8d1ed65ee.220x220x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
