Please!)\nIt was custom built for all niggas like you [lid closes]\nYou just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up\n(Stop! Bitch) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! Stop!)\nWhatever the fuck that is! (Somebody, Help)\n(I can't breathe nigga!)\n(Open this shit nigga!)\n(Open this shit man!)\n(Open this shit!!)\n(Somebody help! Hey!)\n(Open this motherfucker, what you doin')\n(Open it!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be78d5f1fcdafddac07407fe6e45d552.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
