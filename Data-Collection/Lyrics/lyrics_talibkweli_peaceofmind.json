Mike]\n[Sample (Melody): Dee Dee Bridgewater - \"My Lonely Room\"]\n\n[Intro (Overlapped with Hook): Talib Kweli]\nUh.  I haven\u2019t seen it.  I haven\u2019t seen it.  Uh.  Uh, come on and, come on and\n\n[Hook: Sample from Dee Dee Bridgewater - \"My Lonely Room\" with Background Vocals by A. Mike] (x2)\nI haven't seen that look in such a long time\nI've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind\n\n[Interlude 1: Talib Kweli]\nUh.  One, two, and uh.  One, two, and uh.  Yo.  All those shorties around my way, I see y\u2019all.  Do y\u2019all thang, do y\u2019all thang, come on.  Ah.  Uh.  Come on.  Ah.  Do y\u2019all thang, do y\u2019all thang, come on.  Ah.  Yeah.  Let me run it down.  Yo, yo\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nSitting on a stoop, watching chickens fly the coup\nPeople troop through the night in groups.  I got dice to shoot\nWay too late to see this youth hanging on the ave\nPlus my little man's mama just told me he skipped the class\nHe on the corner smoking a stog', looking broke in the blow\nHe opened his soul, said he came to a fork in the road.  \"Son\nI\u2019ve never seen that look in your eye.  What's wrong, kid?\"  He replied\n\"What they\u2019re teaching me in school ain't helping me to live\nIt ain't relevant to me.  Word is bond, the class\nIs so overcrowded, they don't even notice when I'm gone\"\n\"Hold on, shorty.  You're speeding.  Take what they got you reading\nApply it to your life and give it your own meaning\nThere's nothing out here for you, so stop running from school\nYou'll only defeat yourself\u2014that's what they want you to do.  It's that\nSimple\" is what I told him.  \"No one\u2019ll hold your hand\nCount your blessings\u2014not your problems\u2014and stay focused, man\"\n\n[Hook: Sample from Dee Dee Bridgewater - \"My Lonely Room\" with Background Vocals by A. Mike] (x2)\nI haven't seen that look in such a long time\nI've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up\nKeeba?  I heard you\u2019re moving down south to\nAtlanta to be with your family.  That\u2019s what it\u2019s about, right?\nSelling your house and quitting your job, not\nWishing on a star.  Just getting with God.  I\u2019m missing\nYou hard already (Word).  You used to be hooking us up, cooking\nFor us.  It was love.  You was Brooklyn to us\nI\u2019ll remember the tragic loss of the baby\u2019s father\nBeing eight-months pregnant was hard\u2014that made it crazy harder\nPlus I know he loved you, and you felt like you would lose it\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s good you start again and focus on your music\nI got your back on a plane that\u2019s two hours away, and it\u2019s like\nGoing to Queens and taking the A.  Today\nYou sound stressed out.  I know you\u2019re ready to lead, ready\nTo be free and keep a home steady for your seeds, but you\u2019re\nThere already.  If you thought it, it could happen\nThe hands God works with his hours.  You took action\u201d\n\n[Interlude 2 (Overlapped with Hook and Bridge 1): Talib Kweli]\nHoller.  Yeah.  I haven\u2019t seen ya, haven\u2019t seen ya.  Uh.  What?  Come on.  Come on and, come on and.  Brooklyn, y\u2019all.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah\n\n[Hook: Sample from Dee Dee Bridgewater - \"My Lonely Room\" with Background Vocals by A. Mike] (x2)\nI haven't seen that look in such a long time\nI've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind\n\n[Bridge 1: Talib Kweli]\nStay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh\nStay focused, man.  Stay focused, true\nStay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh\nStay focused, man.  Stay focused, uh\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nBig Tobacco targets your children.  Ghetto youth marked\nFor killing, buildings fallings.  We\u2019re just starting the healing\nLight up the truth, make a spark in the dark that\u2019s so appealing that it\nGives sight to the blind and sound to the hard-of-hearing\nWe\u2019re all looking for the truth.  Now look in your eyes for proof\nOr recognize no time to lie to the youth, so I slide\nIn the booth and provide you the soup for your soul, food\nFor your whole body when you feel you\u2019re losing control\nTo some corporation, TV station, or occupation, another\nForeign value system that kill your sensation.  Feel the\nElation of knowing life\u2014you got a lot to live\nStay true and focus on the positive.  Come on\n\n[Hook: Sample from Dee Dee Bridgewater - \"My Lonely Room\" with Background Vocals by A. Mike] (x2)\nI haven't seen that look in such a long time\nI've yet to feel what could be called peace of mind\n\n[Outro (Overlapped with Hook): Talib Kweli]\nSee, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.  I haven\u2019t seen it.  I haven\u2019t seen it.  Uh.  Peace of mind.  I haven\u2019t seen it, I haven\u2019t seen it.
