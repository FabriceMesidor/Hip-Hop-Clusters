Here come the gorillas in the mist\nAnd they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96\nStone cold jheri curls and not one drip\nI sleep with the worms 'fore I swim with the fish\nAnd I ride with my niggas 'fore I roll witta bitch\nIf it don't make dollars, it don't make sense\nAnd I almost got shot cause I hit a fence\n\n[Hook: Ice Cube & The Game]\nMotherfuckers ain't gon' learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\nMotherfuckers ain't gone learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nCall the U.S. government and tell em it's a motherfuckin code red\nNiggas tried to straight up jack me, now they both dead\nThird little nigga got away on his moped\nCaught him 'round the corner, put the beam on his forehead\nJumped in the Impala then smashed through the light\nWithout a one time in sight\nSo I bust a right on Century, headed to the L.A.X\nWhere there ain't nothin but fly bitches and jets\nIn and out of lanes and I almost wrecked\nOff brand nigga in the 600 throwin up his set\nHe must don't know I got the 40 on deck\nAnd the TEC tryna be Shabba Ranks, time to flex\nIt's the third this shit happened to me all day\nGuess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away\nSo I turned down my Spice 1 tape\nAnd hit the switch, emptied the whole clip in his fuckin face\n\n[Hook: Ice Cube & The Game]\nMotherfuckers ain't gon' learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\nMotherfuckers ain't gone learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube]\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bba1920bee43a618432ce43748293ec6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
