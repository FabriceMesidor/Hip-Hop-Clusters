Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?\nOr how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?\nOr how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?\nYou'll deal with God for the lack of respect\nStartin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check\nNow you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that\nWhat's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?\nOkay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot\nYeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget\nAnd all that free thought shit, find a better defense\nBut if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that\nFuck it\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nAlright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man\nWhy don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45216c2c9146eda839b32c37915cfa76.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
