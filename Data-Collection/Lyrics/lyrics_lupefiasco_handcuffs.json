This ain't even a fine\nYou ain't find nothing, homie, not even a dime\nNot even a dime that'll drop dime on me\nI know you was dying so you put a dime on me\nI know that's a crime, you supposed to fight crime for me\nProtect and to serve\nProsecute, correct and return to the homies\nAnd thats gonna send them direct to the curb\nSo you can put 'em back on me\n\n[Hook]\nHandcuffs (10X)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's sitting in the front of the police car position\nHis mission is bending, pinning charges on niggas\nEven if they didn't\nHe's sitting in court lying\nTestifying against defendants\n...Like that\nAnd he love to choke niggas\nHe don't trip with the rich\nHe just like the broke niggas\nProbably did more dirt in the street than most niggas\nEven the old people don't like him\n'Cos of the way he approach niggas\nNigga, you ain't no better than me\nJust a hustler with a badge\nConfiscate the dope money\nPut it with your retirement boat money\nYou ain't building no playgrounds\nIn the poor for some cash\nThat ain't a pension\nThat's a shoe box stash\nWith a Glock to protect it\nWe both undercover, check it\nThinking that the good we do\nGon' out weigh the sinning that we do to collect it\nSaying \"it's for the community\"\nThey don't value us\nOnly around because the property value up\nAnd they gotta clean the street before they put the houses up\nKnock them Section 8's down\nPut them 200,000's up\nFeel he don't get paid enough\nTo kick in doors, to raid and cuff\nSo he use what niggas get on the street\nTo supplement the wages cut\nSo he gotta keep just enough niggas out there hustling\nTo keep his paper up\n...Like that\nMaybe he should be in the handcuffs\n\n[Hook] (8X)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbe43b56e43c0bf22c2ad2f2bce13dd0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
