That shit never come\nI know it sounds strange but today is never done\nI'm up in the Range when the clock strikes one\nWhile y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons\nUp on my feet at the break of the sun\nPresident of the Gangster Na-tion\nWe don't go to war, we go to the store\nWe rob from the rich, and give to the poor\nHip-Hop, oh what a bore\nLettin college motherf**kers run the front door\n(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets\nDon't let Viacom, dictate the heat\nThe nerve of them, I never heard of dem\nAskin me about, my urban spins\nAnd if I got about, a thousand of them\nI'm a crate MC, accordin to them\nFuck that!\n\n[Chorus]\nTomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow\nThis is very hard to swallow\nKeep your hand up on that throttle\nDon't you worry 'bout tomorrow\n\nTomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow\nThis is very hard to swallow\nKeep your hand up on that throttle\nDon't you worry 'bout tomorrow\n\n[Outro]\nAll hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard\nThe West coast warlord, the future is today\nGet your grind on mayne, get your grind on mayne, get your grind on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/284f4145950de6c7f91a598379e2bb40.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
