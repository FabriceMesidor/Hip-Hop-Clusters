Go steal and rob\nAnd while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob\nYou see you're actin like this urge is demanding\nC'mon, wake up... have some understanding\nSociety's a weak excuse for a man\nIt's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand\nBelieve it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he\nGuides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus\nPast the age of... a little child, that's true\nBut folks your age don't act like you do, so\nSo be mature... and put the point to a halt\nAnd if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult\nDon't live in a world... of hate hate hate\nPull yourself together... and get yourself straight\nMen don't steal... hey, most don't borrow\nAnd if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow\nSo be more mature... and kids do your chores\nMake your own money... hey, be proud that's yours\nYou know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite\nStayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight\nAnd a man never loses a fight... in God's sight\nCause righteous laws are overdue\nAnd this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw\nAnd it's true\n\n\"You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?\nWe like to party, like to party\"\n(repeat 3X)\n\nHey young world, the world is yours\nHey young world...\n\n\"Yo peep this...\nMC...
