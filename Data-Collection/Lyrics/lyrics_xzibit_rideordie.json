Yeah!\n\n[Hook]\nWe just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky\nKeep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by\nCause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly\nMy gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by\nIt's either ride or die...\n\n[Verse 2: Xzibit]\n... and don't slip up\nIt's way too late when the bodybags zip up\nReal gangsters pray for they soul when they get up\nYou live by the gun but you'll die by that hit up\nWatch that rig up, find yo'self in a box\nIn a spot where the cops can't dig up\nReal gangsters ain't just thugs in bandanas\nSlugs and big cannons, drugs and big hammers\nReal gangsters open up ya minds and expand 'em\nWhy was 2Pac really spittin at the cameras?\nCause real gangsters get no peace, they want us six feet deep\nOr locked down in the belly of the beast\nReal gangsters make bread, rise like yeast\nWon't hesitate to put hot chrome to ya teeth\nSo fuck beef! Real gangsters load heat\nWhen ya see 'em in the street better call the police, c'mon\n\n[Hook]\nWe just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky\nKeep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by\nCause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly\nMy gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by\nIt's either ride or die...\n\n[Verse 3: Tone]\n... syndrome is a fear\nThat inner-city residents have of they own peers\nPeople in they own community\nUsin a case where two blacks got smoked by one in '93\nAnd ain't now nigga be the murder case\nUsin and servin survival shit as a defense plea\nIn Cali big knot (knot)\nThe judicial system out here'll have you level fo' 'til you rot\nIt's because of the system we violence stricken\nForced to frequent the zone when the reefer's driftin\nAnd it's hella drift cause in Southeast Danglewood\nDamn near, 30 years of Bloodin and Crippin\nAnd we inflicted with a disease mo' trip than an H-I-V\nCan't nuthin protect you from a hundred, drummer 2-2-3's\nYou can call the police\nWear a V-E-S-T but forget about safety\n\n[Hook]\nWe just ride and get high, 'til the sun cracks the sky\nKeep that heat by my side, that's how gangsters get by\nCause it's an eye for an eye, when I bust you that's fly\nMy gun never been shy, that's how gangsters get by\nIt's either ride or die...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cebafeb87cd3844c18012605b852ac2b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
