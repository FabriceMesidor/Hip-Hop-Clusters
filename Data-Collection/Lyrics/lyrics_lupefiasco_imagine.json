We finna do this rap shit\n\n[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]\nMy mind's like 5 mics, rhyme tight, fuck it\nLimelight, shine bright, life short, love it\nLet's fill it with experiences\nBalls in my hand like the grand prize game, aiming for pocket sixes\nThrow back so that, you know when I say\nBack in the day, you know exactly where I go at\nExpanding my vocabulary\nRapping every word off the magazine covers down at Walgreens\nThat's a .357 Magnum like Tackleberry\nAcademics took a backseat like Hightower\nI flowered my power, yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ]\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back\n(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)\n\n[Interlude]\nYo, we got a contract on the table from Atlantic Records\nWhat do you think?\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nWell every rose has its thorn, and if I could be reborn\nI mean to be the king, even Jesus puts 'em on\nSo, Atlantic ocean motion might make you sell funny\nBetcha didn't know the advance went straight to bail money\nThat's right, to free Chilly Chill\nAnd to do it all again, I would sign another deal\nStill kinda paranoid from when they leaked my tape\nJeopardize being friendly just to keep mine safe\nWhen keeping it real goes right, I couldn't keep my faith\nBy third album I was done, you shoulda seen my face\nFuck Craig, fuck rap, fuck this, fuck that\nFuck your 360 deal, nigga, that shit's wack\nI was Truth.com with no backup plan\nGot blackballed, couldn't find a job, tryna backup dance\nThat shit was crazy, thanks to my back-up fans\nI guess what lawyers can't do, (we are Anonymous) the hackers can\n\n[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ & Crystal Torres]\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back\n(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)\n\n[Interlude]\nYou wouldn't change nothin'? Like nothin'!?\n\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nWell, that's not totally true\nYoung Lupe, I wish I could be totally you\nBut that's the way it works, came to bring the pain, that's the way it hurts\nPicking in the scabs from the past just gon' make it worse\nCan't be 21 every time I sit and make a verse\nWhen I did that song with NumbaNine, I was tryna break the curse\nThe good don't make it out of the hood unless the hood make it out you first\nAll you needs just to believe that you can leave\nCrown B and Es made me believe that I could lead\nRighteous deeds, planting seeds for good society\nSo you see that I can't be totally new\nCause there's a future Lupe out there that wanna be both of me too\nAnd nobody really knows what the future holds\nAll the future sins for our future souls\nAnd what I am doing now I couldn't do before\nWhat would you do, man, if you could go?\n\n[Chorus: SIMON SAYZ & Crystal Torres]\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back (yeah, yea yea yea yeah)\nIf I coulda, brought it back\nI wouldn't change a fucking thing\nIf I coulda, brought it back\n(I'ma do the same thing, I'ma do the same thing)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aa1a0cb9e9a473ce83eb531fa78079.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
