Original Gangster\nSong: Pulse of the Rhyme\n\nJust checkin' my microphone once\nAs I check your audio\nIncrease the bass response\nHopein' the speakers blow\nI got no time to sit and flip\nAnd pop bullshit\nTurn up your stereo hops\nInsert the rhyme clip\nClose your windows up\nMake sure it's air tight\nE.Q. the track exact\nSo shit sounds right\nI rhyme of death\nAnd darkness and danger\nYour crib or car\nBecomes a torture chamber\nI write my rhymes with violence\nWhat you expect?\nSounds of pain\nThe snap of a broken neck\nAll alone in darkness I sit each night\nWrite my rhymes\nWith blood upon a butcher knife\nYou say the Ice is ill, and ill I am\nThey try to ban my shit\nAnd I don't give a damn\nRoll up, your eye will get swoll up\nSuckers who flexed\nYo, their deaths got tolled up\nCause I'm not the nigga to toy with\nBoy with the big mouth\nYa got time to riff?\nThere's time to take you out\nPut a couple caps in your ass\nCut your head off\nSend it to your mom with flowers\nCause I'm so soft\nLay on your wack crew\nSmoke the whole bunch\nBury 'em in my backyard\nAnd then I'll eat lunch\nCause I don't give a fuck about you\nOr him or her\nWhenever I'm in the house\nA death just might occur\nIs this real or fiction\nYou'll never know\n\nCHORUS\nWhile you're locked to the\nPulse of the rhyme flow!\n\nOnce I lock you up, you can't get loose\nYou put your head inside\nAnd I placed the noose\nThe mic drips juice slow\nFrom its steel mesh\nMy words feel like hooks\nUnderneath your flesh\nMakin' you twist and turn\nScorch and burn, when will you learn?\nThe '90s are my turn\nTo pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate\nGangster rhyme, yo, I invented the shit!\nWatch me do it, as I do it\nAnd I do it right\nGrab the gauge\nDuct tape on the flashlight\nDon the black ski mask\nAnd come to your house\nCut off your power\nAnd do you with the lights out!\nIs this real or fiction?\nYou'll never know\n\nCHORUS\n\nA pool of blood\nAnd floating body parts\nWould make me grin\nA close view of a razor\nWhen it's breaking skin\nIf you were burnin'\nI'd use gasoline to put you out\nCause I walk alone\nAnd choose the dark route\nNightmares gotta be loved by some\nAnd I'm the one\nYa wanna come, bring your shotgun\nYou ever see your partner die?\nNo? Well I have!\nYou ever see your father die?\nNo? Well I have!\nYou ever see your mother die?\nNo? Well I have!\nSo shut the fuck up, punk\nAnd clear the rhyme path!\nWhat would make me feel calm and nice\nIs a slow slice\nThrough your jugular and windpipe\nThrow me in jail\nI won't even try to make bail\nPut me in the gas chamber\nAnd watch me inhale!\nIs this true or false?\nWell you'll never know\n\nCHORUS\n\nJason, Tales from the Crypt\nAnd the Dark Side\nAnother fly murder, another suicide\nDid these flicks\nHave an influence on my brain?\nI really doubt that shit\nI think that I was born insane\nWhen I was young\nI had a lust for knives and guns\nUse a magnifying glass\nTo fry an ant with the sun\nAnd on and on\nMy lust for death got bigger\nAt fifteen\nI was placed behind a trigger\nAlthough I'm dirty\nNot the one to be swept up\nStep up, I'd love to open your chest up\nI've got no concept of life or death\nAll I want is your last breath\nGive me a motherfuckin' break\nI should behave\nGive me a motherfuckin' shovel\nI'll dig graves!\nI break ill in extra large portions\nWhere's your parents\nI'll make you an orphan\nSo when you're talkin' crazy\nYou better think of me\nThe I, to the C, to the E, to the fuckin' T!\nThere'll be no tears\nNo screams or cries, just a laser beam\nBetween your fuckin' eyes\nYou feel strange well now you know\n\nCHORUS", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
