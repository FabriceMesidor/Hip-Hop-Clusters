Picked off by a dick cop\nWhy you allowing hiccups? Why you just didn't slip off?\nAnd now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square\nHaving a white cop beat me while he offers me squares\nYou gon' torture me, yeah? Well, that's awfully fair\nAll for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years\nBitch, I ain't scared, I'm already here\nTell ya partners and ya friends the next coffin is theirs\nGuess what, bitch? I'm from internal affairs\nLooking for crooked cops to tweak so I can offer 'em years\nHave me tweaking like I'm all full of fear (Alright, I'm tweaking)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04c687414ea567ebf44f05a92c3e86ff.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
