talklin shit, I straight rip 'em\nAnd niggas know I come equip when I whip them\n\n[Short Dawg]\nYou say how can I make these dirty raps\nNumber one albums, back to back\nIf it was 1950, do you think I sell, no\nThey probably throw me straight to jail\nI tell you life just ain't what it used to be\nBetween you and me, exclusively\nEverybody's changed, were losing our minds\nThe government won't help, cause they refuse to find\nA solution to the problems of the inner streets\nIts a shame what our kids are beginning to be\nPregnant teenagers, young gun slangers\nThere ain't no love, there ain't nothin but anger\nWe don't go to church and can't pray in school\nListen real close to what I'm sayin fools\nI know kids who went to school together\nNow they all grown up, tryin to kill each other\nShootouts in the playground is where it goes down\nBut back in the day, we rode the merry-go-round\nAnd some little kid might shoot me tonight\nAnd I always used to wonder what the future be like\nCuss words on the tv and radio\nYou wanna see sex, turn it on HBO\nLate at night, you see women freak women\nSex sales, that's why I keep pimpin\nI grew up in the 70s', somethin like Crooklyn\nBut I was in Cali not Brooklyn\nI could tell the whole world was going crazy\nBut it really didn't happen til the 80s'\nWith freebasin and smokin crack\nA lotta people learned not to joke with that\nStreets flooded, with homeless folks\nWhole families, lives gone up in smoke\nWe're all related to a crackhead\nSometimes I wake up in the mornin and wanna go back to bed\nLayin there thinkin bout things\nAbout the way life change\nHow women used to like to wear decent clothes\nNow they curse like men and dress like hoes\nYou supposed to be a virgin til you marry\nBut teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby\nBabies havin babies\nRappers like me always disrespect ladies\nWonder why its like that, well so do I\nBut I just turn my back and then I go get high\nCause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch\nAnd you bought it, so don't get mad I got rich\nAsk your grandparents, is life the same\nMan thangs change\n\nChorus\n\nThere used to be a time when old folks were respected\nKids talkin back was never accepted\nGet spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap\nBut kids nowadays will curse out old folks\nThen you tell me I need to be a role model\nAnd get these babies off the 40 ounce bottles\nBut I'm not the one who made alcohol legal\nLiquor stores on every corner that's why we go\nBuy 40 ounces and go get drunk\nDon't respect our kids, like no good punks\nAnd then they grow up to be hardcore criminals\nShoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin hoes\nI know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin on the mic right\nSo Baby D won't you tell them what its like\n\n[Baby D]\nIts kinda hard comin up as a youngster\nGotta deal with the roof that I'm under\nEven though my moms got it hard\nMy daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father\nBut times have changed bro\nI never ever seen Santa Claus comin through the ghetto\nBut you know what I always see\nI always see the white man want a black man bank G\nAnd I don't even get in trouble for it\nAnd I don't see nothin forward\nAlways tryin to beat the black man to death\nPunk police tryin hide behind your badge\nAlways tryin arrest somebody\nAll we gotta do is beat him with the billyclub\nHere I come, I comin with my gun\nI'm shootin in the head police now what\n\n[Short Dawg]\nI tell you life is too short for it to be like that\nWe gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack\nWith all them fiends in the streets smokin crack\nWhat you give life is what it gives you back\nCause money in the ghetto ain't nothin new\nBut when you get the money gotta know what to do\nBuy you a business or buy you a house\nJust so the police can't wipe you out\nI heard it in the streets, they say you the man\nSo try to help your brothers and lend a helpin hand\nNow what we gone do\n\n[Mr. Malik]\nWe came to stack dem bodies, killin anybody's like John Gotti\nI said we came to dem some bodies, killin anybody's like John Gotti\nNow run up and get done up and slap black\nI'm hittin blackjack like the casino when I mack slack\nYou wanna play like Al Pacino with this\nType of style with the lyricist, it's funkabis\nKiss sativa and the biscuits I drop\nMotherfuckers know I come down and show me ??\nI don't really care\nFrom the front or the rear\nWord to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear\nIts that master all I intelligent\nChain that I swing from the others is irrelevant\nFor you motherfucker to step to the m-i-c\nI'm down with Shorty, Ant Banks and Mally G\nIts Malik and I freak it's obsolete\nMy technique motherfucker know I flow over beats\nLike water, slaughter dick in yo daughter\nAnd my nuts up in her jaws when she suckin on my balls\nYiggy y'all niggas best to ask somebody\nCause I'm shootin motherfuckers down with the shotty\nIts that motherfuckin master blaster\nIts, its the motherfuckin ghetto bastard", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4879adf970510dea7fa29b937a49bd43.593x593x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
