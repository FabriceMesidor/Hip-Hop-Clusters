The bitch is bad, chill son, she got me tempted\nReminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented\nFresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented\nSippin E & J straight, was bent when I entered\nGave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug\nSee, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug\nTurned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick\nOffered me a drink, Aliz\u00e9, I take a sip\nGot into convo, \"How you been over the years?\"\n\"Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear\"\n\"What you mean? I thought you left that cat,\" which was true\n\"I'm not talkin' about him, another dude\nBeen with him for a year and had a baby by him\nMatter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him\"\nNow I'm thinking setup, could it be or maybe not\nShe said, \"Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock\"\nTried to play it cool, but in my head shorty's wildin'\nUsing me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas\nTy Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti\nGotti was with Trip and two other grimeys\nThe Twins, \"Let me begin, then explain\nI'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed\nStuck without a gat, not prepared for combat\"\nGave the address, told my son there's more cats\nBe there in a second, big gats no half steppin'\nThey flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson\nI laugh in additional, hit them with the math\nHung up the jack, while shorty soaked in the bath\nPlayed the living room, dozed off for a second\nWhen I woke up, shorty was standing ass naked\nMake moves, all this bullshit pussy better be good\nStepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood\nSlow motion, all along bent off the potion\nShorty went down and had a nigga wide open\nIt was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump\nJumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?\nAll the sudden, I saw this black motherfucker\nWith this big ass gat and two other motherfuckers\nBlack masks, clutching duct tape, no escape\nTied me up, smacked me all in my face\nShorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this\"\nAll bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom\nThey yelled, \"We got the bones,\" smiled, then started dancin'\nThe phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage\nThrew me on the phone, said, \"Son, don't worry, yo, we got this\"\nRegardless what the outcome all this bullshit\nTake a nigga word, don't ever go see a bitch, word", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c1555f27e44bd87876d75ca225fcb3a.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
