BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\n\n[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]\nEveryday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed\nNiggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed\nI'm just a lot smarter now\nCause these niggas is banging ten times harder now\nNiggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town\nBetter turn their car around\nRolling the window down (Hey can we talk it out?)\n(Nah, get the fuck out!)\nJohnny got a shotgun\nAnd he ain't even strong enough to cock one\nFuck trying to job hunt\nNiggas got AK's\nNiggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days\nNiggas spray strays and shoot without looking\nNiggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint\nI think the attitudes are twice as worst\nIt takes half the time to get your whole life reversed\nAlways trying to play Rambo with they ammo\nMake a nigga wanna stay in family mode\n\n[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!!)\n\n[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]\nLate nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by\nMurder arrives, anytime\nBullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites\nSome hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light\nWith you in the site of youngsters with automatics\nBusting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates\nThese days, gun play is official with green lights on every block\nThough the sign tells you too it's not best to stop\nOn every corner, Cali niggas are dumping\nYou'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's\nMaking death not so foreign to ya\nNiggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave\nAn armored truck Swiss cheese\nI've learned to stay away from house parties\nI've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving\nAin't no warm welcomings\nMy eyes have witnessed the bend in on\nNights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn\n\n[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!!)\n\n[Verse 3: Hittman]\nNow tell me, what the fuck is this man?\nNiggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan\nCan't even stand\nIn front of your building and chill without yielding\nTwelve year old children that kill, blood spilling\nThugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky\nUsually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die\nYes sir, in the Killing Field I got my life preserver\nAnd I'll do my time for murder\nThese niggas got the nerve to question me\n'Bout the colors that I got on?\nI see that red dot on your knot\n'Bout to get your whole crew shot on\nA Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on\nTook him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list\nPeep this\nI cock back, you bow down\nBust round, bloody the ground\nRetaliation sounds like this\n\n[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\n(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\n(BANG BANG!!
