Cum on your lips and some on your tits\nAnd get ready, \u2018cause this shit's about to get heavy\nI just settled all my lawsuits\u2014fuck you, Debbie!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nLittle hellions, kids feeling rebellious\nEmbarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis\nThey start feeling like prisoners helpless\n'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, \"Bitch!\"\nA visionary, vision is scary\nCould start a revolution, polluting the airwaves\nA rebel, so just let me revel and bask\nIn the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)\u200b\u200b\nAnd it's a disaster, such a catastrophe\nFor you to see so damn much of my ass\u2014you asked for me?\nWell, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na\nFix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna\nEnter in, and up under your skin like a splinter\nThe center of attention, back for the winter\nI'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling\nInfesting in your kid's ears and nesting\nTesting, \"Attention please\"\nFeel the tension soon as someone mentions me\nHere's my ten cents, my two cents is free\nA nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nA tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with\nAnybody who's talking \"this shit, that shit\"\nChris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked\nWorse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards\nAnd Moby? You can get stomped by Obie\nYou 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me\nYou don't know me, you're too old, let go\nIt's over, nobody listens to techno\nNow let's go, just give me the signal\nI'll be there with a whole list full of new insults\nI've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil\nEver since Prince turned himself into a symbol\nBut sometimes the shit just seems\nEverybody only wants to discuss me\nSo this must mean I'm disgusting\nBut it's just me, I'm just obscene\nThough I'm not the first king of controversy\nI am the worst thing since Elvis Presley\nTo do black music so selfishly\nAnd use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)\nThere's a concept that works\nTwenty million other white rappers emerge\nBut no matter how many fish in the sea\nIt'd be so empty without me\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\nI said this looks like a job for me\nSo everybody, just follow me\n\u2018Cause we need a little controversy\n\u2018Cause it feels so empty without me\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nHum dei dei la la, la la la la la\nLa la la la la, la la la la\nHum dei dei la la, la la la la la\nLa la la la la, la la la la\nKids!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43c0028d130e85df2c466f2075684dbe.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
