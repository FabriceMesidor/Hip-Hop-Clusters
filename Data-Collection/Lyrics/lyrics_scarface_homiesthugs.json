How can I ball?\nHow can I catch my enemies and murder them all?\nMy word of flame burn niggas inside their brain\nNiggas can't hang with me and like it changes\nScarface got me on this shit\nWe laced it motherfuckers in their body and face, uh\nGrowin' quicker, liquor made me a daddy and nigga\nNiggas don't wanna see me world wide mob figure\nMOB and his lead keep me weeded\nKey niggas don't wanna see me when I got weed\nIn my system\nCatch another victim, capture bodies\nBring a shottie to the fuckin' party, yeah\nI party all night\nI do this shit 'cause it's wrong but we were born right\nAnd to these niggas in my zone we do it long ways\n'Till these bitches understand, nigga my song pay\n'Cause I'm the man\nNow these are my homeboys, we outlaws till the day we die\nKeep this shit rough and raw my 45\nMake sure that I survive to another day\nTo bust rhymes which from I get paid\nNow that's the end of my freestyle\nBut it was left for dead\nBuy the shit and you can hear it playin'\nWestside niggas\n\n[Chorus: Scarface & Master P]\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)\nThis one for the homies and thug niggas (Uh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8f2e242e8c32bb311fdcab8c0ef63ab3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
