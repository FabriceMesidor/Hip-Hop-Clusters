I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know?\n(I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...)\n(It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro)\nYeah I hear you fool...\nWell let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me\n(Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby)\nYou stay up fool\n(Peace)\n\n[Verse 1: Scarface]\nHe greets his father with his hands out\nRehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child\nThe world is different since he's seen it last\nOut of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last\nAll he had was his mother's letters\nNow he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better\nBut he's black so he's got one strike against him\nAnd he's young, plus he came up in the system\nBut he's smart and he's finally making eighteen\nAnd his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean\nSo he's calling up his homie who done came up\nLivin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff\nAnd had that attitude that who he was was worth land\nAnd with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man\nNow it's different, he done did dirt\nAnd realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt\nAnd can't nobody change this\nIt's 1994 and we up against the same shit\nI never understood why\nI could never see a man cry 'til I seen a man die\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nImagine life at it's full peak\nThen imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy\nImagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief\nImagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace\nEverybody's got a different way of endin' it\nAnd when your number comes for souls, then they send it in\nNow your time has arrived for your final test\nI see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath\nHow much longer will it be 'til it's all done?\nTotal darkness at ease be at all one\nI watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate\nYou took his life, but your memory you'll never take\nYou'll be headed to another place\nAnd the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face\nI still gotta wonder why\nI never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die\n\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nI hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong\nBut you kinda scared of dying so you hold on\nAnd you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low\nStop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go\nBecause there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try\nAnd you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die\nYour spirits leave your body and your mind clears\nThe rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here\nYou start your journey into outer space\nYou see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place\nSo you standing in the tunnel of eternal life\nAnd you see the ones you never learn to love in life\nMake the choice, let it go if you can back it up\nIf you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up\nBut if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free\nHere lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace\nI still got to wonder why\nI never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18ac25f7f227afdf0cd10b2b3414bcf3.600x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
