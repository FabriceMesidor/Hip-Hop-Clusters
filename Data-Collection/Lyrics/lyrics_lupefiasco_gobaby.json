(Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\nGo baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker\nExtravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese\nYou best believe\nThat you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker\nExtravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese\nYes indeed!\n\n[Hook 1]\nWhere my ladies at?\nI said where my ladies at?\nLet's find somewhere we can go crazy at\nAnd for you baby I'll be your maniac\nHey hey hey hey\nAnd you don't have to worry 'bout nothing\nCause every time I see you baby you'll be rolling with me\nOh I'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime\nHolding up my sign and it say\n\n[Hook 2]\nGo baby!
