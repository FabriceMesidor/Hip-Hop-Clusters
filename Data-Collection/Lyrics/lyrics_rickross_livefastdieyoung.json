good!\n\n[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]\nThey say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives\nWell we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight\nAnd you know they gon' be bangin' this shit\nFor the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)\nAnd die young (die young), live fast (live fast)\nAnd die young (die young), live fast, and die young\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nLivin' fast, now it's all linen rags\nHard-headed, but my top peelin' back\nTinted glass on my '57, nigga wit' a attitude (Me)\nYoung and radical, methods are mathematical\nLet my convertible marinate on the avenue\nMami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido\nDie young, but fuck it, we flew first class\nTurned you to a rich bitch by your first glass\nUp in this bitch and we lit up like a screen\nEvery time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend\nStuntin' like we printin' money with machines\nWhat you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantine\nLike Mike, my Spikes stay all white\nTwenty-four karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice\nIce insured, fuck life insurance\nI live for the moment, and put a bullet on that (Bawse)\nGot the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat\nI'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go\nGood party over here, everybody over here\nYou know the word travel fast, everybody know we here\nAll the bottles over here, even spread it over there\nAll the models over here, but they swallow everywhere\nShe came to party like it's 1999\nIf she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes\n\n[Hook: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]\nThey say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives\nWell we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight\nAnd you know they gon' be bangin' this shit\nFor the rest of our lives, so live fast (live fast)\nAnd die young (die young), live fast (live fast)\nAnd die young (die young), live fast, and die young\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nFor all my young ladies ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy\nDrivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby\nHop up out the (ERR!) she eat up the pavement\nI don't give a (ERR!) baby, he crazy\nI'm back by unpopular demand\n'Least he still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan\nHoppin' out the van, screams from the fans\n\"Yeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!\"\nAnd we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler\nSo I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya\nDr. Martin Louis the King, Junior\nAnd I'mma never let the dream turn to Kruegers\nMy outfit so disrespectful\nYou can go 'head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you\nI mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish\nNiggas done mistook me for my stylist\nAnd I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes\nBut we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed\nSo go ahead and just pose\nWhen she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze\nAnd I know they tryna get they cool back\nAnd them ghetto bitches hollin' \"How you do that?\"\nUhh, so they could never say we never lived it\nAnd if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute\n\n[Hook: Kanye West]\nThey say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives\nWell we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight\nAnd you know they gon' be bangin' this shit\nFor the rest of our lives, so live fast\nAnd die young, live fast\nAnd die young, live fast, and die young\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nPeter Piper pickin' peppers, Rick pitch poems\nMy leather long enough to keep a thick bitch warm\nWhen that ass is enormous, abs abnormal\nAnd tans in the morning on sands in California\nSeems like we gettin' money for the wrong things\nLook around, Maseratis for the whole team\nLook at Haiti, children dyin' round the clock, nigga\nI sent a hundred grand, but that's a decent watch, nigga\nI'm gettin' better, cause it woulda leased a drop, nigga\nI'mma get my money right, just watch, nigga\nShe had a miscarriage, I couldn't cry, though\nCause you and I know she was only my side hoe\nUh, I got 'em catchin' amnesia\nTime to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer\nSee the lynx and you just think, \"Jesus!\"\nI'm hot 'til the day they freeze us\nYoung and radical, methods are mathematical\nI'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues\nTook many to war, shook never before\nFor my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur\nIce insured, fuck life insurance\nThree bad bitches, don't come concurrent\nStill, you know the dope won't stop\nAnd if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch\n\n[Hook: Kanye West]\nThey say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives\nWell we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight\nAnd you know they gon' be bangin' this shit\nFor the rest of our lives, so live fast, and die young\nLive fast, and die young, live fast, and die young", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/21f98d27036e0a6bfd95a7c1ed9b7036.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
