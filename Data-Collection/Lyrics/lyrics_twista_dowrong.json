Kelly party\nSo I pull up the club in the Coupe\nLook at how them jeans huggin the boots\nSaw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell\nHave you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin bitches up\nSocializin with everybody flirtin with girls but got plans to go home\n'Til I felt the way you was backin up on the thang\nGettin down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong\nShe a (bad muh'fucker) she could bass a deuce\nA fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone\nTake a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron\nAnd I was gone, she a (bad muh'fucker)\nTake a look at them hips, and how she lickin them lips\nLike she was lickin ice cream\nBallin with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene\nListenin to some Al Green might (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Hook 2X: Twista] + {Lil' Kim}\nThat's a girl that you shouldn'ta fucked with\nBut she so seductive, got a nigga head gone\nNow you know it ain't right, got a girl at home\nBut tonight she the type that'll (\"make you do wrong\")\n{This nigga that you shouldn'ta fucked with}\n{But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone}\n{Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}\n{But tonight he the type that'll} (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Lil' Kim]\nI got the champagne and popped the top\nAnd then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on\nI don't know what I'mma tell my dawg\nWhen he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home\nShit, he about to be rockin it\nLookin sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's\nBreak a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis\nUndressing his body with telekenesis\nGot on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft\nGot in the car and dropped him off\nTryin to sink down as low as I can up in my seat\nCause I'm rollin in the Hummer and the top was off\nMy guy sleepin anyway and that's whassup\nBut I'm paranoid, drivin fast as fuck\nThinkin 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib\nHere come my man in the front, askin me what (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Twista]\nI don't know what you talkin 'bout\nBaby whyon'tcha go on back to sleep\nI was at the police station, when you hangin in the club\nWit'cha boys gettin drunk 20 deep it'll (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Lil' Kim]\nIf you got up with a ho\nShoulda told the bitch use another douche\nIf you was at the police station, shoulda smelled like heist\nBut you comin in smellin like puss what'll (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Twista]\nWell I couldn't resist\nCause she was thick as hell and so cute\nSteady comin at me, she was throwin it all on me\nAnd I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Lil' Kim]\nWell I know what you talkin about\nSo we can do it like this\nI'mma go and ride, you can do what you do\nCause I done met another brother with some bomb-ass .. it'll (\"make you do wrong\")\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6e50ebd81ceeb1860beb446ab2cdec8e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
