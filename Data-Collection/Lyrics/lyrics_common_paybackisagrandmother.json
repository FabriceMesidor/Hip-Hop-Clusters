They up mags\nAnd told everybody, \"Put your shit in the bag\"\nMade people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)\nHad the place took in a minute and some seconds\nAsked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)\nSaid she couldn't remember\nShe was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em\nCause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me\nWith they pants hangin off they ass\nGot her some water - and begin to think\nHow these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?\nSomebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)\nWhoever did it better have Blue Shield for real\n'Cause yo, it's the big payback..\n\n{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}\n\n[Verse 2]\nLater that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up\nThem niggas probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut\nWalked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)\nDiscussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger\nThese niggas next to me, was talkin bout the heist\nWhoever did it even got Jordan for his ice\nSaid that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin\nHad to use all my might not to ask no questions\nPut down the magazine, went to the pop machine\nNoticin these cats, had the Bling Bling\nThey wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team\nA week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring\nThis hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's\nWas braggin bout robbery they had done\nBy now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I\nSee gramps bracelet\nI'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run\nIt's the big payback..\n\n{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy imagination roamed as I got in the chair\nThinkin - when shit went\nDown, I wish I was there\nFuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care\nHave your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear\nThese chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it\nSaid it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's\nEight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky\n(Like who?)
