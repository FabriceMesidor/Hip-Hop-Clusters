And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?\nBut it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out\nWith nothing left to give, with nothing left to say\nWhen no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight\n\n[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Francis and the Lights]\nBut it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out\nThat shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now\nDon't need closure now, just keep the shirt now\nSorry you were led to believe\nBunch of different stories that was never to be\nNo you isn't ugly I just said it to be\nFunny we both know that you look better than me\nSorry I started runnin' when you ran into me\nI'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be\nAnd I'm getting better gotta hand it to me\nSeem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nToday I missed my workout, but it worked out\nNow I'm missing work now, but it worked out\nHad to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house\nHad my first kid, I love how she turned out\nI love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out\nI'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse\nI'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out\nI hope it work out\n\n[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nI believe in long distance love, God that's above\nBond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed\u2014\nYeah, y'all interrupt, you all in a rush\nWe all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room\nIf I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'\nWe could re-run the show, we could re-bump into 'em\nIf we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom\nIf we read the wrong one, baby we jump the groom\nI'm ready to be groomed\nI'm ready to assume, the position is filled\nI was ret since the womb\nI was not made for this, this was made for me\nAnd it's gonna work out\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]\nToday I missed my workout, but it worked out\nNow I'm missing work now, but it worked out\nHad to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house\nHad my first kid, I love how she turned out\nI love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out\nI'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse\nI'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out\nI hope it work out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f65690b7ce634c0bab6c1d5b5c2cb81d.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
