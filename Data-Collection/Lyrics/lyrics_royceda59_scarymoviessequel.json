Wanna make a scary movie?\nRappers coming in with their team and carry toolies\nYou can jump right out of the screen and barely move me\nWe hard hitting, directing and starring in it\n\nYo niggas from the Wall don't bleed, Dirty Dozen niggas don't bleed\nRoyce 5'9\" don't bleed, Rock City niggas don't bleed\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll this room in this big house you chose the attic\nYou running slower and slower so you froze in panic\nI'm wearing a white mask, black cloak and dagger\nYou scatter hoping for life, grabbing ropes and ladders\nUnder this robe, I'm tatted up, automatic'd up\nI'm mad as fuck, I'mma kill no matter what\nYou - live in the wrong house, at the wrong time\nYou've - answered the call so you all mine\nYou can't put fear in the heart of the heartless\nGot a list of names just don't know which one to start with\nAt your house, staking it out, posing as carpenters\nLooking for closets and house guns with cartridges\nI'm low down and stressed, I go around the rest\nOf the house looking for Granny to throw down the steps\nAnd when it's your turn - oh you know it's tragic\nAnd the music in the background is so dramatic\nI'm tryna lift you off your feet - hope you know gymnastics\nTry to - soak the mattress with rope molasses\nYou try to - cover your head like a prophylactic\nNext time somebody calling your phone, don't answer it\nHello? Hello?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nWe making names for each other like the Wayans Brothers\nRock City niggas always name each other\nNiggas got crews, don't even claim each other, 2000", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d86b45b993cdf0c53559e740521a4bba.500x494x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
