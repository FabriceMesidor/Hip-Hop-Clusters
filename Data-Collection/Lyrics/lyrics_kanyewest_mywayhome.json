Kel', I bail and it -\n\n[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]\n\"Might not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again\nI'm on my way home\nI left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone\nHome is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/20be4a5ccc57daf3577b7e0d12f092f8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
