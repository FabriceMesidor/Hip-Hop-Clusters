Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place\nThey got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'\nParticipated in felonious behavior\nCock the cocked 45, snatchin' niggas pagers\nLabeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit\nWe started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit\nGod damn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man\nNigga got my own plan\n\n[Hook]\nI am unstoppable\nI know that you want me to fail\nBut no I won't\nI'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box\nUntil I sit in Heaven I will never stop\nI will never stop\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nI got a handgun habit, nigga front I'll let you have it\nWhen the shots go off, cops sayin 50 back at it\nI'm allergic to the feathers on these bird-ass niggas\nFront and I'll put your brains on that curb fast nigga\nI ain't a marksman, one spark and I spray shit\nNuff rounds from that H-K, I don't play bitch\nMove like I'm militant, back on that gorilla shit\nMoody, disrespectful, unruly, but niggas can't move me\nI squeeze till I run out of ammo, if it's a problem it's handled\nI have your people pourin' our liquor and lightin' candles\nYou fuck around I blow your brains on my New York Times\nRun home, turn to the sports section and read your mind\nIt's crystal clear, you should feel when that gat bust\nFirst there's crime scene tape, then you end up in that black hearse\nWe don't go to funerals, but we'll go to your wake fam\nDo your body all banged up, (inaudible) you made a mistake man\n\n[Hook]\nI am unstoppable\nI know that you want me to fail\nBut no I won't\nI'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box\nUntil I sit in Heaven I will never stop\nI will never stop\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThere's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice\nCause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me\nMy poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat\nYou can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep\nI'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap\nI'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped\nI bully these rappers so bad lyrically\nIt ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money\nYou can't pay me enough for you to play me\nIt's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady\nMy noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo\nI got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal\nIt's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it\nThere's no humor in it no more, you know\nI'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag\nYou need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass\n\n[Hook]\nI am unstoppable\nI know that you want me to fail\nBut no I won't\nI'll keep fighting until the day I'm in a box\nUntil I sit in Heaven I will never stop\nI will never stop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
