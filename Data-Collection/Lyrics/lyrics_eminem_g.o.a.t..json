\u2014 \"No.\"\nYou better save some of them kids from Madonna\nShe needs all the publicity she can get\nYou wanted Shady, well you got it, man, I ain't apologizin' for shit\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a G.O.A.T. and I don't mean to gloat\nBut I know what I know and I know what you think\nAnd these magazines'll never put it in ink\nBecause how would it look\nIf they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?\nAnd for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is\nIt means the Greatest Of All Time\nAnd I consider myself one of those\nSo thank you very much, here it goes\n\n[Outro]\nMan, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home\nMan, shit is too easy\nNobody even wants to pass me the ball\n\u2018Cause I'm a G.O.A.T.\nSo don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game\nAnd y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best\nBut y'all know that I'm a G.O.A.T.\nAnd like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best\nBefore you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch\nBut before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much\nTo everybody who wasn't there from the start\nAnd thank you very much to everybody who was\nAnd y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it\n\u2018Cause I know that you know that I know\nThat you know that I know that I'm a G.O.A.T.\nI'm out y'all, it's been real\u2014peace!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/92a4caddb38548f811a9d5b5599e4304.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
