Newton rocked the Black Panther party\nWe need to wake up these strategies are old\nUnity that's the goal let's go\n\n[Chorus]\nThat real shit just keeps flowing\nThat real shit just keeps going\nThat real shit just keeps flowing\nThat real shit just keeps going\n\n[Verse 2]\nLine after line after line after line\nSince 1989 I been way ahead of my time\nBut it's frustrating hearing all the hating and debating\nAnd the faking and the waking, man we got to reawaken\nThe time that we be wasting, debating and fighting\nWe can see we unenlightened, man look what we writing\nYou got the most advanced technology in the palm of your hand\nAnd all you can do is turn around and diss your man\nThat's like a baby with a loaded gun\nThinking its a load of fun, me, I'm a little older son\nWe done seen dudes dies and cry and get by\nWe done seen cops shoot down blacks and just lie\nSo when Latifah put up U-N-I-T-Y\nWhy didn't anyone comply, y'all living a lie\nThe truth is the proof and we got to get it straight\nRevolution only works for those that participate\n\n[Chorus]\nThat real shit just keeps flowing\nThe real shit just keeps going\nThe real shit just keeps flowing\nThe real shit just keeps going", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7b1daf2ed6f9ee66a79dbc610af91d7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
