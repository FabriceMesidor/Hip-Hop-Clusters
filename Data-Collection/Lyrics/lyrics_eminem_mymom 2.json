Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'\nWhat the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?\nSlut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'\nGo find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra\n\n[Chorus]\nMy mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her\nBecause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom\n\n[Verse 2]\nWait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner\n\"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?\nNow here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait\n'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes\nYou little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make\nThat retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it\nYou better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it\nPut your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again\nAnd I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there\nIn one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving\nAnd if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again\nThen when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit\nYou little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?\nA rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it\nChild support, your father, he ain't sent the shit\nAnd so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid\"\n\n[Bridge 1]\nMy mom\nThere's no one else quite like my mom\nI know I should let bygones be bygones\nBut she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her\nBecause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom\n\n[Bridge 2]\nMy mom loved Valium, now all I am\nIs a party animal, I am what I am\nBut I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach\nBut my buzz only lasts about two minutes\nBut I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it\nI can't even write a rhyme without you in it\nMy Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan, I never thought that I could ever be\nA drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me\nBut that's actually what has ended up happenin'\nA tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me\nAnd it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?\nPharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful\nShe killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it\nFeed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache\n\"Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?\nLook at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it\"\nBut I don't need it \u2014 \"Well fuck it then, break it up\nTake a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up\"\nAlright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'\nI'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'\nStumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed\nWith a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead\n\n[Chorus]\nMy mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her\nBecause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs\nThat's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom\n\n[Outro]\nMy mom, I'm just like her\nMy mom, my mom, my mom\nMy mom, my mom, my mom\nMy mom, my mom, my mom\nMy mom, my momma\nMe momma, I like-a da momma\nHaha, sorry Mom\nI still love you though\nDr. Dre, 2010\nHey, this shit is hella hard, homie\nYo, take us on outta here\nWoo!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/280d45965a412d7e2a115e2db61d79f2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
