Ohhhh... funny how time flies when you're having fun\n(Nas: Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're on a winnin' streak\nYou've survived the killer streets\nNow you at the crap table, where the real villains meet\nNumber seven might get you to Heaven\nYou break the bank, just might make you a legend\nIt's after eleven, you playin' against a poker face\nGenie eyes, light green, sippin' on Bellini's\nYou play your cards right, she'll let you touch\nShe'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus\nBetter know who to trust\nShe might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs\nI'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em\nThe crews do somethin' new, inform me\n\n[Cee-Lo]\n(I.... have Less Than an Hour)\nOhhh... time will wait baby\n(I.... have Less Than an Hour)\nEw-ohhh.... ewwwwwwwww.... hmmmmm..\nI'm in the pursuit of my own personal power\nAnd I only have an hour", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28a9bee4feec89428ab7a50c299d11ec.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
