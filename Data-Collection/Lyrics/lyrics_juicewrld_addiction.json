This is not a sad face\nI'm having a good day, sarcastic\nPops called my phone, I was flabbergasted\n'Cause I don't have no pops, I'm a bastard\nAnd I don't have no friends\nThey only come around for a good time not when it matters\n\n[Chorus]\nMy mama know I suffer from addiction\nShe like my father she hopin' I was different\nBut I ain't trippin' I know my sins ain't forgiven\nI ain't Kodak baby I got morning tunnel vision\nBroke up with the drugs but I think I need them right now\nSecrets that I can't keep right now\nConfessions, it's a curse and a blessing\nThey say your word is your weapon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
