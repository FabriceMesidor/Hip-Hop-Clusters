(Fred) Who? Fred?\nWho the hell is Fred, I stood by the door\nBy that time someone jumped in the window\nNow what the hell was I do?, I got lucky\nThe girl packed a twenty-two\nHit him in his head, there she laid him\nThe pastor standin' by the door I sprayed him\nAnd headed for the back\nI seen that same old brown Cadillac\nIt kinda messed me up at first\nCause the brother that drove that Caddy rode away in a hearse\nI opened up fire on the ride G\nWho I was shootin for was standin right behind me\nI had a double barrel pointed at my back\nCould this be the end of Mr. Brad?\nI don't know what happened to the front\nWell that's about the time the closet door it opened up\n(On your ass trick!\nI'll be damned if I go out like the last)\nHeh, five-0's on my back, mane\nThey know me by the face, but they don't know my last name\nNow I'm back on the case\nJust call me Mr. Scarface", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bfc55f1e39dab482dd5f87425202cda6.453x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
