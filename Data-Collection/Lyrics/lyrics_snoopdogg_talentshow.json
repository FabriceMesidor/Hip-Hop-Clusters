Snoop Dogg was made for kissing\nA barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me\nPleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory\nMy SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me\nAnd now we prancin' on stage at the talent show\nWe flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack\nFull of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope?\nPrincipal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke\n'Bout my money trippin' even if I fold it wrong\nBlowin' zones with Wiz 'cause this is the protocol\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c99dd335733f9c3cf16f57c9f589cfb.361x361x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
