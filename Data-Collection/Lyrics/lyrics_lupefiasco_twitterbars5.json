Next time tie me up properly\nLu-Dini is unimpressed by this shoddily botched locksmith mockery!\"\nIf I'm trapped in a paper bag just make sure it's a pen in it\nCause that bitch gone look like the roof of da Sistine Chapel when I'm finished\nPaper Bags?! I'm the guy they use to rap the mouth holes in paper masks\nA major task's for any one not trained in the art of hatin' trash\nThat's why I practice so fiendish\nTo make sure every little flicker of garbageness of my inner rap self is aggressively extinguished\nIt's what defines meanness, in a mean defined linguist\nThat leaves behind lines thick as linguini\nEvery time I string a stream of mean shit\nNow that's a mean twist\nLike a towel getting wringed by a man with a machine wrist\nI'll give you back Hoffa but you gotta hand over the Teamstas!!!\nSo ends today's bars...enjoy your day...\n#FL2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
