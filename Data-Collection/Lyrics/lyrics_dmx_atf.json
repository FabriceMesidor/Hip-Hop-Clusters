Beep Carlos\nTwo houses over by the tall black fence\nI keep the hooptie parked for situations like this\nThere go Grease, yo, get in, you drive\n[Grease] What the fuck you doing nigga? Tryna stay alive\nCops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by\nWho the fuck could'a snitched? Must have been a new guy\nDamn, they back on our ass\nPut your foot back on the gas, step on it fast\nTrying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast\nTrying to take the niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass\nHey, look out, (bark) damn, came so close\nYou almost hit that bitch (Like you said nigga, almost)\nShit, the cops hit her and I know they ain't gon' leave her\nGo up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather\n(Drop it on the floor)\nBOOM, got it through the door\nPedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'\nDeath is in the air and I don't know if it's mine\nBut I know if it's time, it'll be what it is\nAnd all I can think of is, \"What about my kids?\"\nShit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips\nHit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout\nRun through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out\nCaught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear\nI'm going out fast and the last thing I hear is\nBOOM, BOOM, BOOM, open the door, ATF", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8314b41ccd0d9cc7825bc168024bdec2.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
