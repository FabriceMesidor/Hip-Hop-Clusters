I'm a freeman, where your shows at?\nI took you out in '86 and the whole world knows that\nFor 30 years nigga, you ain't spitting no rap\nQueensbridge hates your ass, you can't go back\nYou flow whack, and let me say this for my black kids\nTechnically I ain't take you out Shan, the crack did\nSo gather 'round for the celebrity roast\nI killed Shan already, so it must be his ghost\nI still got it, ain't you get it?\nCause of you the Bridge was over\nTill Nas came back with Illmatic\nYou don't even rap good, G you not hood\nYou're the opposite of Nas\nJust spell your name backwards\n\n[Break]\nYou still ain't get the lesson\nYou still ain't get it\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne hit, two hit, three hit, four hit\nShan you need to forfeit, you already lost it\nFace that shit, taste that shit\nHip-hop didn't need your career so I erase that shit\nYou done, the only way you gonna win this battle\nIs if you bite my name and call yourself Shan One\nWith the \"W\", but you don't even think that fast\nI'm the first and the last, you\u2019re the worst from the past\nI'm the Blast, Master, KRS-One\nWhat's up? After 30 years you just stand up?\nAfter 30-something years you just man up?\nS-H-A-N is still hugging a nut\nWhat the fuck!? You called my wife out? Man that's so whack\nBlow! Nigga hold that! Blow!
