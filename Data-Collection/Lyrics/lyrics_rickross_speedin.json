Kelly]\nFast life, I live\nBig cars, big cribs\nSpeedin'\nI'm speedin'\nI can't stop it's all I know\nFrom a young'n I was taught get dough\nI'm speedin' (speedin')\nI'm speedin'\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nSee people came lookin' for me, I got ghosts see the west coast\nClose and up in the Le Montrose\nBig money boss major\nAmerican Idol, I got fans like Fantasia\nRead between the lines or yo ass like fantasia\nGet hit between the eyes, he died, they can't save him\nIn the Porsche, I\u2019m weavin', no coke, no coke but I\u2019m speedin'\nStarin' at the skyline, I got a million on my mind, I'm the best\nAnd these pussy niggas runnin' out of time, Ricky Ross\nI'm the chill, quarter mill for the time piece\nYeah, I a bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece\n\n[Hook: R.

Kelly]\nSittin' in the living room watching the Grammys\nWishin' that was me that was on the Grammys\nAll I needed was someone to get behind me, money rain on me\nI was a determined lil nigga, dirty shoes and Hilfiger\nHomie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer\nNow I'm flyin' high cause my gift grew wings\nAnd now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds\nKells and Ross on the Hollywood scene\nRed carpet and it's smellin' like green\nNow foss cause I got paid off\nCollabo was the hit hip-hop and R&B boss\n\n[Hook: R.
