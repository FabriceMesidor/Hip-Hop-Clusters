I think nada\nLame rappers you Lady Gaga\nThe part you dear depart these niggas like I'm shootin' commas\nState your business or forever hold your peace\nGo 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet\n\n[Verse 2: Bun B]\nGot damn, who would've thought it would've been me?\nStreet legend that came up with a pen, G\n16 bars to get me out the ghetto\nAnd I always kept it real with the people, I never settle\nThere's a lot of folks dependin' on me to lead 'em the right way\nInstead of listenin' to what the radio might play\nSome real game for somebody that did it\nWho could break it all the way down so everyone could get it\nAnd I gotta admit it, the road was bumpy\nHand-to-hand combat, sometimes I live lumpy\nYou can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though\nJust make sure when you on the side of right, bro\nYou don't go in thinkin' you makin' history\nBut lookin' back in retrospect it ain't no mystery\nNobody ain't ever did what we did then\nAnd ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary\n\n[Chorus]\nLegendary niggas, we some legendary niggas\nLegendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us\nLegendary niggas, we some legendary niggas\nLegendary niggas, all we do is kill it\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nWhole life we grindin' for the dough\nAnd leave behind a legacy, the legend of the two\nIt's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth\nIf anybody gon' do it know we gon' do\nWhole life we grind so hard to stay official\nAnd make them niggas hate in back with brand new waitin' tissue\nThey sick to they stomachs, fuck 'em, I ain't never loved 'em\nPeace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit\nPeace to the youth\nThe young soldiers in the street who gettin' to the money, they remindin' me of me\nWhen you get that, better keep that, better not let that drop\n'Cause someone gon' be right there and they'll take yo spot\nWe got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked\nMy haters wanna blast, man, you better stop\n'Fore shit get good, you could see his guts\nAnd it's too late for surgery, they can't patch 'em up\n\n[Verse 4: Juicy J]\nYou see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments\nYeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas\nI come sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement\nNah, nigga, stay high, the bitch I'm with is high maintance\nHomie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on\nWe gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone\nYou don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons\nBeen about crutons, bro, that's why the roof gone\nWe still comin' up, that's what my dollar say\nAin't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate\nMobb Deep and Juicy J been ballin' harder than Doctor J\nBroke niggas what we can't tolerate\nGot that movie money\nModel chick came out the 'cuzzi money\nBeat a nigga ass, now he wanna sue me money\nStill in this bitch, wakin' up at 5:46 in the mornin'\nMoney callin', never stallin'\n\n[Chorus]\nLegendary niggas, we some legendary niggas\nLegendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us\nLegendary niggas, we some legendary niggas\nLegendary niggas, all we do is kill it\n\n[Outro: Prodigy]\nWho the fuck are you and what the fuck do you know?\nWhere the hell did you come from and where the fuck are you goin'?\nWho the fuck are you and what the fuck do you know?\nWhere the hell you come from and where the fuck is you goin'?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
