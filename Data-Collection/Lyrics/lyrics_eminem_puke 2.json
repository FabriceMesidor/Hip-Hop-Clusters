I haven't got a clue\nNow I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to\nBut every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke\n\n[Hook]\nYou don't know how sick you make me\nYou make me fucking sick to my stomach\nEvery time I think of you I puke\nYou must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow\nYou may not think you do, but you do\nEvery time I think of you I puke\n\n[Outro]\n*Eminem pukes into the toilet*\n*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*\n*Toilet flush*\n*Eminem burps*\nAh, damn!\nFucking bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e76120b9dd2c0af6f1b3f8d3dcbe11d2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
