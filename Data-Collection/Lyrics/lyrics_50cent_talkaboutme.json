That niggas get down, right?\nI used to say, all I know, is the nigga get money\nAnd you standin' in my way, excuse me dummy\nRonda she told me that nigga a freak\nAnd McDonald's ain't the only thing that he eat\n\n[Hook]\nMan everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be\nI hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI love 50 Cent, that's my dad\nBut even my mom talk about him bad\nShe says since he blew up, he changed for sure\nHe's really fascinated with these fancy hoes\nI don't know why but there personalities collide\nAnd my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride\nYou know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy\nThey just like him cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady\n\n[Hook]\nMan everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be\nI hear niggas running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me\n\n[Verse 4]\nMan 50 fucked up, I mean real fucked up\nHe left us in the hood we fucked up\nI can't believe this nigga gettin' all this money\nStill actin' like he in the street tellin' niggas they can't eat\nYou know this motherfucker went and bought Tyson's crib\nGot Bentley's, Ferrari's, and all that shit\nHe don't even come through to try and help niggas out\nThat's that bullshit. See what I'm talkin' about?\n\n[Hook]\nMan everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be\nI hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me\n\n[Verse 5]\nThat's my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right\nHe ran to me cryin' sent him back out to fight\nPut a battery in his sock or pick up a rock\nYou ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk\nLook at my first Grand baby, he is a big rap star\nBought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car\nI taught him what it takes, to go this far\nBoy I'm the reason you are what you are\n\n[Hook]\nMan everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be\nI hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me\nMan everywhere I go, I mean like everywhere I be\nI hear everybody running they mouth, you should hear how they talk 'bout me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/312964ccc0d0d604db10044f85c36fb0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
