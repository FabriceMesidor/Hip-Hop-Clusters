They send you out to reel you back in\nAnd its all for the (money)\nCause envy breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hate\nThey on the taste for the (money)\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nMy biggest gift and my curse\nMore money, more problems tell me what's worse\nGetting audited by the government, giving up millions to the IRS\nOr having to take a paternity test from a bitch I never met\nI'm getting sued by my own family member, all cause my dog bit her\nAnd she was the one who walked up and put her hand out, and now she got her handout\nIt's driving me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned out\nWhat else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me when every time I turn around\nAnother money hungry motherfucker suing me\nTruthfully, I've had it up to here\nAnd it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year\nThey listen closely, and I was really demonized\nThat I was told to go to school, graduate and get a job\nBut I'm a Hip Hop cash king, rapper from the South\nAnd everybody wants the easy way out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, rappers foreclosin' on their houses\nCan't keep up the payments, they owe a couple hundred thousand\nSay they making millions, and bills steady pillin'\nDiamonds on their neck, they kids' stomach out here growlin\nGet your priorities in order nigga\nYou talk about it, but you really can't afford it nigga\nThat car you bought depreciated once you drove off\nNo wonder your baby momma wanna knock your nose off (BLAHHH)\nHalf the industry going bankrupt\nYou see em' smiling in the club with their drinks up\nDon't let that television fool ya\nOff camera they sweating and stressin\nMy young students, let me school ya\nThe diamonds ain't worth half what you bought them for (no)\nSoon all that Gucci don't fit, now you out of dough\nOne day your pocket's alright now they all wrong\nFuck you gonn' do when it's all gone\nTalkin bout the\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nLemme talk to these hoes, woadie\nUhh, uh\nImagine being worth a 100 mill\nYour potentials of having a billion is only real\nImages, more bitches and they named in your will\nA new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill\nYou choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mill\nAll you wanted was some entertainment\nAll she wanted was some litigation\nExploiting a simple penetration\nTelling the courtroom that I'm being evasive\nShe wanted to walk into the SunTrust\nShe made me sign over my lil son's trust\nTake away the joy my lil daughter brings\nBitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings\nMisfortunes of a rich nigga\nYou watch BET while she look at the big picture\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62819740802d113d74cdf35e32db7990.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
