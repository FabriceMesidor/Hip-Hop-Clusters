Is it the spot you set us in?\nAlmost magic, better than medicine\nTake one of these and put your mind at ease\nI get more work than a lot of M.D.'s\nIf I'm hawkin' New York or out on tour\nI express the raw dialect and explore\nBut don't get fooled by metaphor\nDouble oh seven is back\nRest assured\n\n[Outro]\nFeel secure\nRest assured\nRest assured\nYo, feel secure", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c242f8367734db09ac26eb1c1bbcee98.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
