Ron device\nThen pass the audition\nTo the poor hands sided in maelstrom's position\nStreet sales in comparison pale to the Scottsdale bail bonds commission\nIt's like trappin' out the pawn shop\nGettin' close to the magic like the wrappin' on the wand box\nThird layer from the wave\nAnd grant absurd last prayers and first favors from the grave\nTo crack the pipes like icy nights and turn mayors into slaves\nPolitics bring fevers to punish dealers\nAdjudicate the Jostens and stop the ring leaders\nThe Geese Howards and King Ghidorahs\nCook E in the family tree for steam fevers\n\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean]\nMaybe, maybe you'll feel me when I (maybe you can feel me when I)\nFeel me when I say (feel me when I say)\nWhatever don't kill me (don't kill me, don't kill me)\nGets me through the day (gets me through the day)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aa1a0cb9e9a473ce83eb531fa78079.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
