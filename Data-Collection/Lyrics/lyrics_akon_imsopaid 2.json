Yeah!\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI get it in 'til sunrise\nDoing 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ahhh!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla get money\nWhy you wanna count a nigga money?\nI'm a hustla and I don't need them!\nOne of them ya'll see! I'm so paid\n\n[Verse 1: Akon]\nI see police on the crooked I\nDoing a 100 on the Interstate 95\nMy shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die\nWishing that motherfuckin' would, \u2018cause we're certified\nGot a system that'll beat and knock your wall off\nGot a pump under my seat, the sawed-off\nGot a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off\nAnd them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all\nIt ain't too much to put a strain on me\nThat's the reason why I had to put the blame on me\nI rather have them dollar bills rain on me\nThan let them haters come and make the name off me\nThat's why\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI get it in 'til sunrise\nDoing 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ahhh!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla get money\nWhy you wanna count a nigga money?\nI'm a hustla and I don't need them!\nOne of them ya'll see! I'm so paid\n\n[Verse 2: Young Jezzy]\nShe said, \"Young, why your voice so hoarse?\"\nI just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)\nPaint look like a sugar free Red Bull\nI'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full\nAnd that's before the taxes\nTook my own gross net and hid it under my mattress\nUsed to get bored and count 20's for practice\nPaper therapy we let money relax us\nGold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps\nI made a killing in the water, kill them in the water\nAgainst all odds and I will not stop\nThey try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top\nAnd my project chick, I moved her next to Joc\nShe said the house too small, I moved an extra block\nSo, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block\nI told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI get it in 'til sunrise\nDoing 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ahhh!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla get money\nWhy you wanna count a nigga money?\nI'm a hustla and I don't need them!\nOne of them ya'll see! I'm so paid\n\n[Verse 3: Akon]\nI am the boss it only takes one call\nFor a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all\nGuess what? I won't be taking that fall\nHomie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for\nHa ha, ain't that funny?\n\u2018Cause niggas want war but ain't got money\n\u2018Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning\nQuicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running\nYeah! Akon! Weezy!\nBlack Royals holdin' down Jersey\nDevine making sure we getting it up front\nMy little brother Bu got that vision, baby\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI get it in 'til sunrise\nDoing 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ahhh!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla get money\nWhy you wanna count a nigga money?\nI'm a hustla and I don't need them!\nOne of them ya'll see! I'm so paid\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]\nAhem, Big Money Weezy\nWhite wife beater with the Sig underneath it\nHow do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated\nSnap my fingers, disappear from the precinct\nYeah, I'm ballin', we ball out\nBall 'til we fall until the ball bounce\nI send some niggas with guns at y'all house\nOnly to find out you live in a doll house\nDamn, but I thought you was tough, though\nWe carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat\nWe bury cowards on the set that they come from\nWe know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke\nWe bomb first when we ride\nYou in a hearse when you ride\nI put my shoe down, baby\nAnd I'm holding down Young Moolah, baby! That's why\n\n[Chorus: Akon]\nI get it in 'til sunrise\nDoing 90 in a 65\nWindows rolled down screaming \"Ahhh!\"\nHey-ey-ey... I'm so paid\nNumber one hustla get money\nWhy you wanna count a nigga money?\nI'm a hustla and I don't need them!\nOne of them ya'll see!
