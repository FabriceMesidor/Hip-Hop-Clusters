Do you need this?\nDo you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?\nI could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead\nWhat is your wish? It can be granted\nYou're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa\nWhere is Rudolph? You're parasitic\nI do not have self-control\nI am startin' to wonder\nIs this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)\n\n[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]\nI'm your puppet, you control me\nI'm your puppet, I don't know me\n(Did I wait too long?)\nI'm your puppet\n(Did I wait too long?)\nYou control me\n(Did I wait too long?)\nI'm your puppet\n(Did I wait too long?)\nI'm lonely\n'Cause I'm your puppet\n(Puppet, oh)\nYou control me (Control me)\nI'm your puppet (Puppet)\nI don't know\nI'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)\nYou control me (Puppet)\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nYou lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me\nAyy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see\nA to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe\nRun a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe\n...on a...\n...on a...\nFirst, light the weed\nFirst...\nFirst... (Got me by a string)\nFirst... (Got me by a string)\nFirst... (Got me by a string)\n(Oh, Lord)\n\n[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]\n(La, la, la, la)\n(La, la, la)\nBreathe on a song\n(La, la, la)\nBreathe on a song\n(La, la, la, la, la, la)\nBreathe on a song\n(Cut me loose)\n(La, la, la)\n(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)\n(Cut me loose, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nBut at some point, you come to your senses", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f49c5b7408c82981df2e3e01900b527d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
