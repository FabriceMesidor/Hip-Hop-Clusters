He fucking sucked in bed\", well uhh\u2026\nI think we both know that I worked that ass\nI hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class\nI'm trying hard not to use a specific reference\nBut you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence\nSo let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip\nIf I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it\n\n[Chorus]\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nNobody really wants you\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nNobody really wants you\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nNobody really wants you\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nWho's in love with you now?\nI swear to God, I swear to God I am\nNobody really wants you\n\n[Outro]\nNobody really wants you\nNobody really wants you\nNobody really wants you, wants you, wants you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a9c598da4e86fefcb845cbbe74706aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
