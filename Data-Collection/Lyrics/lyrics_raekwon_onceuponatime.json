I had a love that would ignite all the fire\nThe desire would leave, for you I'd admire\nLately... you seem all corrupt\nI've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers\nDrove me to arms of another\n\n[Raekwon]\nBroke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck\nReal love, hope this ain't the last time we meet\nFelt like a King who had a Queen want him\nI usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick\nOn our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind\nA lady's starin' at me, all in my mind\nSayin', \"Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge\"\nYou stay three forths and I'mma wiz you\n\n[Tekitha]\nMonths ago.. you came to me\nTold me... love me forever\nSee.. time has passed.. and lonely days\nHave rid his head now.. stormy weather\nBut out of the rain.. came some delight\nI ain't ashamed.. I know that it's right\nThe way that I'm feelin'..\nHe touches me.. in ways I like\nSays things you won't.. won't day or night\nGivin' me healin.. I'm leavin'\nCuz you wanted to know.. that is the reason\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tekitha]\nThe only set back in my state of grace\nIs that.. the love is real.. for you and him\nIn different ways.. and\nYou're out in space.. yes here on Earth it's fun to play\nI wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray\nAnd he gives what I need\nQuenches my thirst when you say \"Girl, please\"\nThat's a waste of my breath\nIt's funny to me.. that you get upset\nAnd I told you quite often\nI'mma fill up the space.. did ya think I was talkin'\nOut the side of my neck..\nYou left me alone, what did you expect?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Raekwon]\nI'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid\nI'm terrified, shorty was deep\nI had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab\nLike a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo\nShe had the yolk on me that's when I went broke\nWe used to flip coke together, get boasted and float\nWe split real bread, we was large\nWe had our weddin' in the garage\nAnd then she stopped reviewin' my bars\nHold up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tekitha]\nHeeeeeeyyyyyy... yyyyyyyyyeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhh\nForever.. ohhhhhhh bbbbaaaaaaabbbbbbbbyyy\nOhhhhhhh yyyyyooooouuuuuu yyyyyyyyyyoooooooouuuuu\n\n[Hook to the fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8703b73c19201fea3baccb6c300ec07e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
