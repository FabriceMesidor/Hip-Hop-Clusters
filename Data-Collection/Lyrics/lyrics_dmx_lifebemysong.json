I'mma eat\nI never had a problem with surviving\nNo problem with getting down, busting my guns, or ruff rydin'\nCats talk slick but I talk slicker\nMy shits for real cause I'm that nigga\nThe reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems\nStraight to the lord, no body else can solve them(?)\nSee what I see but look through my eyes\nThe devil is a liar the truth never lies\nWe all got issues\nShit that we go thru\nShit that we been thru\nShit that we won't do\nThe pain that we bring upon ourself\nFor no reason, is the worst!\nThat's why I say I'm blessed with the curse\nThe Lord gave it all to me\nAnd in the process, I lost my soul\nDamn! the devil got a hold\nIn my mind, I'm like a little boy\nLost in crime\nLike the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying\nThe lord knows I'm trying\nBut at the same time\nYou hear the nigga with the weight of the world!\nWhy you gave it to Earl?\n\n[Hook x2]\nI'm gonna go hard\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nTill the dead and gone\nIt's on!\nWhat ya'll really want?!\nBring it on\nI'mma let life be my song\n\nTo live is to suffer\nAnd I'm living it up\nFace everyday chin up\nI ain't giving it up\nCause if I ain't giving a fuck\nThe who will?!\nSo I hope for the best\nKnowing that its all uphill\nSometimes I wonder what's lifes about\nSometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route\nThen turn around and go out\nAnd no doubt, the fate in mine is blind\nSo whatever, fuck it, I'mma roll out\nWe all go through the motions\nWe get different notions\nWe each have our own ocean\nThat we can either drown or float\nLike the vessels that we are\nVessels that would carry many far\nDont know what to say, when you talking\nDont know who you gone see, when you walking\nIf you dont know how much of what you do is dirt\n3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt!\n\nNigga!\n\n[Hook x4]\nI'm gonna go hard\nWhether I'm right or wrong\nTill the dead and gone\nIt's on!\nWhat ya'll really want?!\nBring it on\nI'mma let life be my song", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3843bd8bdb5f681116b197d8a9226af4.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
