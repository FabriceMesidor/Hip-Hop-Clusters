Find me rotting the apple\n'Bout to bump so plump, 'bout to lock in the grapple\nFeeling like the highest man about to tackle\nFacts like the tat under the cap of the Snapple\nCats get decapitated for acting a fool\nBlacks get their ass sprayed just for making a move\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]\nWe get high and say \"Fuck the police\"\nThat\u2019s why we get high and say \"Fuck the police\"\nThat\u2019s why we get high and say \"Fuck the police\"\nYo\n\n[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]\nCause every time I make a move they be sweating me\nThey want another black man in penitentiary\nIt's even hard for that man standing next to me\nCause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me\nIt's like every step bring me close to destiny\nAnd every breath I get closer to the death of me\nI'm just tryna carry out my own legacy\nBut the place I call home ain't letting me\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$]\nCause you can't get by if you don't respect an OG\nYou can't get by if you don't respect an OG\nYou can't get by if you don't respect an OG\n\n[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]\nCause every corner I turn a nigga testing me\nAnd every morning I mourn just for the less of me\nSometimes I ask the Lord why he be blessing me\nAnd not my brothers whose souls now rest in peace\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me\nHope for a nigga like me\nJust pray there's hope for a nigga like me\n\n[Verse 6: Joey Bada$$]\nI'm something like the chairman of the board, ranting\nI feel invincible like McMannon\nOne of the last original emcees that's left standing on the planet\nStrike like a meteor, do remedial damage, damn it\nCats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded\nBy the lyrical New York City bandit\nTrue Warrior like Rembrandt\nYo some cats claim they fly but really been landed\nI really can't stand it, let me take a seat\nThis where Rosa Parks her bum now make some room for me\nPE in your beeper, hun you can read it and weep\nMy old hoes call me now, leave a message after the beep\nI don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak\nI don't wanna speak no I don't wanna speak\nI just wanna be, girl, I just wanna be\nI just wanna be free\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & BJ The Chicago Kid]\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me\nHope for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me\nI pray there's hope for a nigga like me, for a nigga like me\nCompton to Bed-Stuy\nHope for a nigga like me\nHope for a nigga like me\nHope for a nigga like me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0833b93271d0e8a8d00025a5530fdf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
