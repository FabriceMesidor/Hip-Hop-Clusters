Well shawty where the vogues at?\nT.I.P. ain't the shit? come on shawty, don't act\nI'm the hottest thing ever flowed over 24 tracks\n\n[Hook] X2\n\nSome niggas wonder how I made it, I do what it takes\nAt school I was cool wit the nigga who threw a 22 in ya face\nTook ya starter coat and choked ya til you blue in the face\nOr you might know me as the nigga who fucked ya bitch and bust 2 in her face\nEither way, I'm a winner like the 4 and the trey\nYou probably never held mo dough than I can blow in a day\nSometimes I'm wearin gold, sometimes I'm ridin on it\nBetween us, I doubled up off my signin bonus\nK.P. and Jay say \"Shawty, ay you goin legit\"\nBut I ignored the shit, when I scored a brick\nI bet you never knew how quick 36 O's'll flip\nYeah I cook it til it bubble up, see how quick it double up\nCompetition's in trouble I'm supplyin the hood\nBorn, bred, when I'm dead, I'mma die in the hood\nNiggas be tryin the hood, I open fire in the hood\nShut 'em up, wet 'em up, and let 'em lie in the hood\n\n[Hook] X2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d4010b5f2aa7374582fd8c3be5913af3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
