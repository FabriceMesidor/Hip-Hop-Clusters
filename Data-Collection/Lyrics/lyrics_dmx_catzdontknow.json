Look at what she made you do\nNow there's love lost and a double cross\nPointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce\nSo you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)\nFive bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh)\nTen g's in the shoebox under the bed\nAnd for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head\nAnd from then, the moral of the story if you missed it\nIs the grand will always be there, just never go against it\n\nRepeat 1 (2x)\n\nYou cats must not know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/feee09d03a61305e2411309887ea4205.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
