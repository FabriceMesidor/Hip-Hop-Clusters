I would say - some people would say thoughtless\n\n[Kanye]\nIf I had not done what I felt and I just thought\nThen it would've just never happened\nAnd when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality\nLike \"oh I can wear this hat too\"\nI think people get mad at me when I name my idols\nAnd I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney\n\n[T.I.]\nI just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt\n\n[Kanye]\nI really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them\nHalf the shit Trump does, I don't agree with\n\n[T.I.]\nWhat half do you agree with?\nLet's get that out\n\n[Kanye]\nJust the ability to do what no one said you could do\nTo do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me\n\n[Kanye, to someone else in the room]\nDid you play that umm, the one that said\n\"Tell Daddy what you learned in school\"\n(You wanna play with that, boy?)\nI wanna play with that, yeah\n(Alright, okay)\n\n[Kanye, on a playback of \"Ye Vs The People\"]\n\"I was in debt and the car that broke\nThe same shit I've been saying for years they called it \"loc\"\nSuccessful man, a man that [?] the [?]\nThe most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes\nAnd play with them\"\n\n[Kanye]\nYou could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that\n\n[T.I]\nSure\n\n[Kanye]\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd your shit come in, you say\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?\nHow could that be?\n[murmurs]\"\nYou know what I'm saying?\nThe exact conversation we're having\nAnd what would you say?\n\n[T.I.]\nSure\n\"Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this\nSome things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against\"\nThat would kinda [gestures], you know\n\n[T.I., in recording studio]\nLet me hear it bro, let me see what we got here\n\n[T.I. listens on a set of headphones]\n\n[T.I., recording]\n\"... you're goin' now\n'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down\"\n\n[Kanye, recording]\n\"... know everybody emotional\n\"Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?\nBecause it's cultural?\nOr how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?\nOr how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?\"\n\nOr uhh, I could fuck your bitch\n\n[T.I., recording]\n\"Here's a suggestion, be selective with your critical views\nOf people who done made greater contributions than you\"\n\n[Kanye, on a playback of \"Ye Vs The People\"]\n\"I know Obama was heaven-sent\nBut ever since Trump won, I felt like I could be president\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
