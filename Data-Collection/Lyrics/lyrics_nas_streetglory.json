QB, Vernon and 10th\n12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat\nWhat could you tell me? Nigga's seen it all in this game\nWhen it's all said and done just remember my name\n\n[Pop]\nI'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime\nEmbryo of the ghetto born face and time\nNiggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine\nGhetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined\nHow do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?\nWhere corruptors and new police being recruited\nSomehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded\nWhile the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed\nMany thought's cause I see the past grimmly\nThat could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street\nThrough all the pap grease and street chases\nSudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases\nI blew smoke through hallway window\nWatched the buddah clouds linger\nPluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers\nMy eyes flip different shades\nSimilar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways\nSeein' nothing but another day\nIn this six story rat trap\nThem gats clap another nigga's blazed\nEvents in my hood rotate\nLike the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love\nBefore I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs\nComing at you kisses and hugs\nWhen death calls who's really a thug\nThe street glory got me deeply in love\nCan't shake it, can't take it, can't make it\nGot me needin' this drug\n\n(Chorus)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f9769d8dcc0630bf3631c07688bcfb5.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
