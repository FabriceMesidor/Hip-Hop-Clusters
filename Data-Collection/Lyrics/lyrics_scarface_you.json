It's just beginning\nBut in a minute I'll be waving the flag cuz I don't think that I can take all that\n\n[Hook - Ceelo Green]\nMe and my mother are like sister and brother\nShe said ``Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do\"\nI've lived longer and secrets made me stronger\nAnd you wonder how I already knew\nIt's cuz I'm already you\n\n[Verse 2 - Scarface]\nI remember walking home from a party we had shut down fighting\nThey came from another neighorhood so we ain't liking it\nThe beatdown started from the inside, wiped them\nFrom one side to the other side like Tyson\nWe heard gun shots and ran like lightning\nHeart beat way too fast, I'm frightened\nThat's when I realized that niggas pack guns too\nAnd not afraid to shoot a motherfucker if he had to\nWe was some young dudes, living life wreckless\nDrinking MD, vandalizing shit, restless\nWe went from stealing hotshots getting sessted\nTo kick those burglaries, Warren got arrested\nThat's when them dip had us thinking we was bad man\nWhen Eric B. said to ``clap your hands''\nI'm just imagining the shit I did\nIf what I've done is goin' affect my kids\nShit\n\n[Hook - Ceelo Green]\nMe and my mother are like sister and brother\nShe said \"Son I've done things I'm ashamed of, but I had to do\"\nI've lived longer and secrets made me stronger\nAnd you wonder how I already knew\nIt's cuz I'm already you\n\n[Verse 3 - Scarface]\nI seen myself where my mom was\nMy mom like my grandmom, my kids like I am\nEvery day is like a standoff\nDon't fuck up like I fucked up\nYou may not be as lucky, I'm a rare case\nCoulda went the other way, trust me\nJust do your best and I ain't mad if you miss it\nYou are gifted, it's up to you to make the best decision\nCuz one day I'll be leaving this game and ya'll have to carry on my name\nOK", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8962738e6fdff4298d09683da33f7a92.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
