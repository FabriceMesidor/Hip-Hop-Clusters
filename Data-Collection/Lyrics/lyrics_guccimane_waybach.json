Wizop\n\n[Chorus]\nRidin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back\nThis white on white Maybach, I call it payback\nYeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back\nI'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track\nCatch me flushin' down the street with the top way back\nI had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at\nMan y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back\nNow let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the bestest, I'm the freshest ever stepped on the scene\nI mean what I say, I say what I mean\nKeep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem\nSomebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream\nA college chick dream big man on campus\nAll these folks impersonate me like Elvis\nToo much sauce and I'm not selfish\nI rule with a iron fist wrapped in Velvet\nThe seat way back and the top laid back\nHer waist real small but that ass real fat\nShe get turnt up and you can't turn back\nShe make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back\n\n[Chorus]\nRidin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back\nThis white on white Maybach, I call it payback\nYeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back\nI'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track\nCatch me flushin' down the street with the top way back\nI had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at\nMan y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back\nNow let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the slickest, I'm the richest ever rapped on the track\nIn the S600 with the seat way back\n1017 mob boss, I don't play that\nI'll get your whole head knocked off if you say that\nI had a long-nosed .38 way way back\nI sent a nigga to the pearly gates way-way back\nThey thought that Gucci Mane was soft now they don't think that\nPlease get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that\nMy own clothing line Delantic man, yeah I read that\nYou heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?\nI lost 200k in Vegas, yeah man I blew racks\nMan get these broke ass niggas away from me, they ain't worth two stacks\nIt's Gucci\n\n[Chorus]\nRidin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back\nThis white on white Maybach, I call it payback\nYeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back\nI'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track\nCatch me flushin' down the street with the top way back\nI had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at\nMan y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back\nNow let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/919612a4b991939bf9b7caf210f56294.750x717x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
