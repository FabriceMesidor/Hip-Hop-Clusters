Am I livin'?\nIt's fuck feelings, sorrow go up to the ceilin'\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, oh, oh-oh\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNow I am insane\nDemons in my brain, love\nPeace I can't obtain\n'Cause all these girls the same, love\nNow I am insane\nDemons in my brain, love\nPeace I can't obtain\n'Cause all these girls the same, love\n\n[Outro]\nAll these girls the same, love\nThey're rotting my brain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42ee8afddd7cdc99e3eace8772d948d5.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
