Hold your head wherever you at\nOn the flow from the cops or wings on your backs\nThat snitch nigga gave police your location\nWe'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation\nKiller listen, shit ain't the same without you at home\nPhony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone\nThey really fear you, when you was at home you was pale\nThat's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail\nBy the time you hear this rhyme you probably be locked up\nTried to hussle, where along the lines your plan slipped up\nGot caught up in a crime that you can't take back\nReminisce on how I use to pick you up in the Ac\nYears ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep\nWonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep\nAt night, you know my mouth is tight\nI never sang to the cops cos that shit ain't right\nSometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack\nDamn, why the situation go down like dat?\nIt'll be a long time before the heat dies down\nIn a couple of years, fool we'll see you around\nBut til then maintain and keep ya story the same\nThe cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame\nThey harrassin, strugglin to find the truth\nIs it a chance ya case'll get thrown out cos they ain't got no proof\nTo say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy\nDeliver me the gun, I'll tie two, quickly throw it in the river\nMake sure it's safe to the bottom\nOur smart police snuck you out at the projects, we got em\nBut still, but still, but still......\n\nChorus x3\n\n(Surprisin)\n*repeat to fade*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42d069fe8357b9423abc0b46d79ba08d.398x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
