I let your fuckin' eagle fly free\nNigga, I'm pioneerin' all the sound ya hearin'\nEarth from steerin', high mountaineerin'\nI sincerely fuck you up severly by the yearly\nKeep the sky clearly\nI'm straight from the seventies\nMockneck colors wit ya bitch ass disappearance\nGive me clearance, I don't want no fuckin' interference!\nI'm the Big Black Jesus!\n\nThrow ya hands in the air! And wave 'em, fuckin' Wu don't care!\nAnd if ya +'Bout It, 'Bout It+\nLike we're +'Bout It, 'Bout It+, let me hear ya say, \"Oh yeah!\"\nOh yeah!
