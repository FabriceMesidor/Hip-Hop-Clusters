I don't be having no packages\nNow I'm getting dressers, lamps, and big mattresses\nI go crazy when I smell your odor\nI just wanna pick you up and take you to Ponderosa\nSteak and potatoes whatever you want\nAlright just the buffet my publishing check didn't come\nYou don't care about D12, you don't know about Bizarre\nAll you know is that I'm weird and I wear a Wonder Bra\nTHat's fine... I just wanna make you mine\nNiggas say you a three, I think you a dime\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Proof]\nI love the way your body grinding all in my face\nOnly thing on your mind is which wallet to rape\nYo ass look so perfect with your thong on your waist\nBuilt like a stallion you belong in a race\nGot money by the barrel, King Kong in the place\nMovie and a dinner is as long as I wait\nHey, I ain't in your ear all talking dates\nGot you dizzy off the crissy, you ain't walking straight\nGot a room key in yo booty and let's cultivate\nYou so pretty love them titties, they soft and fake\nBring yo friends damn, your skin smell like coffee cake\nYo, meet me at the place when you get off at 8\n\n[Kuniva]\nThe way you moving got me bugging out\nAnd you quit to take off your jacket and slug it out\nWe thug it out, pouring 40s out, We give each other daps\nIn fact We both hate going out, we both hate small gats\nYou the truth, yo, for real yo I love you to death\nAnd if we break up I'mma stalk you and bug you to death\nUntil you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes\nWe went from hugs and kisses to shoves and pushes\nIt's all love take it in stride I'm only joking with you\nI don't get down like that, you know I'll never hit you\nBut still and yet if I ever feel I'm about to\nI'll gently grab your shoulders and SHAKE THE SHIT OUT YOU, GIRL!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Kon Artis]\nI take 'em light skin, dark skin, short and black\nAttitudes sassy and they asses fat\nCorporate suburb but you can be a classy rat\nLouis Vuitton cost too much to have a bag to match\nGirl, forget all that, I'm getting rich off rap\nAnd you can be my A&R as long as you got my back\nSagittarius are entrepreneurs and that's a fact\nAnd your birthday is seven days after mine correct?\nWell, that's two thing we got in common, baby\nHope it ain't a problem that I'm involved with Shady\nCause come next year I will not be dating\nCause my plans to be with your stanking ass, okay?\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6246e5d82871d591568c0f8881ed9690.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
