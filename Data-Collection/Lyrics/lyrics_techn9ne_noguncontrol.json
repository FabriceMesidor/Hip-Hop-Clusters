'Cause they all shooting\nUhh, hey, yeah everybody shooting\nUhh, and you should be scared of us\nAhh, they scared of us\n'Cause we out of control\nWe ain't got no gun control\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nFeeling nervous, got a little trouble on my mind\nI can turn a murder around and turn death fear to it\nNow damn near do it\nThink it's exposed\nJust 'cause I'm sagging my clothes and tagging my toes\nAnd beat the peace out of peaceful nigga\nThanks for yanking the breaks off a gangster hate officers\nGot a lot of mo', I got a lot of mo'\nI see Trump\u2019s got a lot of votes\nAmerica is a salad bowl\nAnd you can put the dressing on it\nChop it up and fool a lot of folks\nIf it's coming my way after trunk 'cause the Trumpers get carried away and I'm thumpin' my thumper 'cause gum bumpin' don't mean nothing if people is out of control\n\n[Hook: Gary Clark Jr.]\nJust because we're carrying guns don't mean we wanna use them\nPeople abuse 'em, yeah we all losin'\nLook at (you!) 'Cause they all shooting\nUhh, hey, yeah everybody shooting\nUhh, and you should be scared of us\nAhh, they scared of us\n'Cause we out of control\nWe ain't got no gun control\n\n[Guitar Solo: Gary Clark Jr.]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dac1cf83fc6c83ed086fa8adde3a8bc2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
