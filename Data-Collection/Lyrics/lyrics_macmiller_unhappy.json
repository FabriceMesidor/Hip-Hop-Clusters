(Yeah)\nWhy are we so unhappy? (Yeah)\nWhy are we so unhappy? (Yeah)\n\n\n[Verse 4: Mac Miller]\nOkay, okay\nSo can you, tell the captain that his boat about to sink and Mr. Drummond's wife is somewhere smoking meth on the ship deck\nWe living in a shipwreck, nothin' but some insects, obsessed with sex and this business giving big checks\nBeen ready to die until I realized I haven't lived yet, I haven't made an indent to the Lord to try to impress (praise God)\nI just wish that I was fearless, biking down the mountain start to tremble as the gears switch\nSo hear this hear this, come bathe in my appearance, when life give you a car learn to steer before you crash\nThere's more than cash and there's more than ass, 'cause all those pleasures turn to torture fast (fast), and you can try to fight it but you never win (no), they assemble into evidence to keep you from the truth and the lies (lies)\nWe fall into the glamour like a cancer, the answer is there ain't an answer, bitch\n\n[Outro]\nWhy are we so unhappy? Yeah\nWhy are we so unhappy? Yeah\nWhy are we so unhappy? Yeah\nWhy are we so unhappy?
