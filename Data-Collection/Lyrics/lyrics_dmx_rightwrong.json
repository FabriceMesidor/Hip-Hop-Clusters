And now they know\nWhatever which way they go\n\n[Hook]\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\nWhatever which way they go (right, wrong)\n\n[Outro]\nWhatever which way they go\nThey know they gonna owe\nThey soul to the road they choose\nIt don't matter if you win or lose\nYou still gotta pay them dues\nYou still gotta pay them dues\nYou still gotta pay them dues", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e960df995f69f71e6fb29abf9972d94e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
