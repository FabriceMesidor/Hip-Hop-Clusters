That's how Ruff Ryders roll!\n\n[Verse 1]\nNiggas wanna lie, niggas wanna try\nThen niggas wonder why, niggas wanna die\nAll I know is pain\nAll I feel is rain\nHow can I maintain, with mad shit on my brain\nI resort to violence, my niggas move in silence\nLike you don't know what are style is\n\nNew York niggas the wildest\n\nMy niggas is wit' it\nYou want it? come and get it\nTook it then we split it\n(You fuckin' right we did it)\nWhat the fuck you gonna do, when we run up on you\nFuckin' wit' the wrong crew\nI'ma have ta show niggas how easily we blow niggas\nWhen you find out there's some more niggas, that's runnin' with your niggas\nNothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle, light it up like a candle\nJust cause I can't stand you\nPut my shit on tapes, like you bussin' grapes\nThink you holdin weight?\n\nSing that shit!\n\n[Hook]\nStop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop! (What? What? What?)\nOhhh! Nooo! That's how Ruff Ryders roll! (I can't hear you!)\nStop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop!\nOhhh! Nooo! That's how Ruff Ryders roll!\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, Is ya'll niggas crazy?\nI'll bust you and be Swazy\nStop actin' like a baby\n(Mind your business, lady!)\nNosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you\nYou know I'm trying to get rid of you\nYa I know it's pitiful\nThat's how niggas get down\nWatch why niggas spit round\nMake ya'll niggas kiss ground, just for talkin' shit clown\nOh you think it's funny then you don't know me money\nIt's about to get ugly, fuck it dog I'm hungry\nI guess you know what that mean, come up off that green\nFive niggas or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene\nGive a dog a bone, leave a dog alone\nLet a dog roam and he'll find his way home\nHome of the brave, my home is a cage\nAnd yo I'ma slave til' my home is a grave\nI'ma pull paper, it's all about the papers\nBitches caught the vapors then how they wanna rape us\n\n[Hook]\nStop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop! (uh-huh!)\nOhhh! Nooo! That's how Ruff Ryders roll! (what? what? i can't hear you!)\nStop! Drop! Shut 'em down, open up shop! (uh-huh!)\nOhhh! Nooo!
