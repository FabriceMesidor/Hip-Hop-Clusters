Am I blessed? See what I mean\nIt's a test, life is a test\nLife is like a hood, hard\nTrying not to fall between the cracks\nIn the cracks it's so dark, and the dark\nSeems more appealing than the light in the land\nWhere you gotta fight\nCatch a body in the night, we need a plan\nTo survive, to survive the land\nSurvive the storm, when it comes through\nEither you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to\nLook what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?\n\n[Verse 2: Erykah Badu]\nThis bitter land is far too real\nThis bitter land, it does not heal\nCause in the land skies are grey\nBut we fight the storms that come our way\nA boy who strives to be a man\nMust push to lead with all he can\nOh, this bitter land\nOh, bitter land\nOh, oh, oh, oooh\nThis bitter land, can't stop my fight\nThis bitter land\n\n[Outro: Nas (Erykah Badu)]\nLook what it's come to\nSo what you gonna do?\nWhat you gonna do?\n(My land)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/328ec34099f44f9b36eabca9b2cbe6d2.620x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
