We'll never know\nI'm late for my date with destiny\nLet me go\nLet me go\nYou've got to let me go\nRight or wrong\nLet me go\nI'm on my path\nLet me go\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMy mama loved me more than I do\nShe said, \"ya pops was just like you\"\nTrapped in a vicious cycle\nJesus' youngest disciple\nTell the judge if he throw a book at me\nMake it The Bible\nStarted calling myself \"The King\" for lack of a better title\nLoyal beyond belief to my detriment\nIt's so vital I change or blow opportunities\nLike a choir recital\nNow while I do not care who telling\nMeanwhile, selling powder puts food in the bellies\nWell it's unfortunate\nThe orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages\nKid go to school stupid, they teachers ignoring it\nSorta just doomed, forced into being a goon, selling kush in a jar\nMixing up the tar in a balloon\nConsumed with the same way of life I left\nEverything I know now, I learned by myself\nAll you see are the whips\nThe Maserati's, Ferrari's, so they don't sympathize\nDon't nobody feel sorry\nNo mercy\n\n[Chorus: The Dream]\nThere's no mercy on me\nNo crying myself to sleep\nNo mercy on me\nNightmares have become my dreams\nNo mercy for me\nGood morning reality\nWill I wake? We'll never know\nI'm late for my date with destiny\nLet me go\n\n[Verse 2 : T.I.]\nEverybody's standing and waitin\nChanting, they' hating\nGospels say they should forgive me\nThey'd rather hand me to Satan\nBlatant, displays the day of hypocrisy\nBoy you got to be kidding\nCould it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?\nRemember that, when he was here?\nAnd when he died you realized you need him here\nGod with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear\nHindsight: 20/20\nFuture not as clear\nBut I'm a rider 'till I die\nPut bullets 'tween my eye\nI just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye\nFuck up the world like Lady Di\nOn the day he died, his wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried\nTo be a better person, nah, they wanted better verses\nThey could market to the merchants\nBut when they' closed curtains\nYou could be for certain ain't nobody perfect\nBut when you're rich, nobody gives a shit\nNo mercy\n\n[Chorus: The Dream]\nThere's no mercy for me\nNo crying myself to sleep\nNo mercy for me\nNightmares have become my dreams\nNo mercy for me\nGood morning reality\nWill I wake? We'll never know\nI'm late for my date with destiny\nLet me go\nYou've gotta let me go\nLet me go\nLet me go\nLet me go!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f55abc725080eb05147e45ce3cd406a8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
