Counter or clockwise?\nStill civilized\nKill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies\n\n[Verse 2: Masta Killa]\nGive no extension on the lynching\nIt's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned\nIt's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun\nAnd reveal how he really feel, confirmed\nHe'll never live after the show\nSee the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax\nThrowing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm\nDay 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday\nMy ninjas lay in ravines and ditches, underneath shrubs and leaves\nThey breathed through underwater reefs\nThe enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud\nOff shore banks, tanks approach the location\nBombarded by the circle of death formation\nTelecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes\nShattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell\nInhale these venomous thoughts that I propel\nThrough the north facility, the city must suffer\nAt the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent\nAt three minute intervals the heat intenses\nDeadening the power from electrical fences\nDefenses are down, shake a nigga up\nBounce him off the sound\n\n[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]\nYou know what I'm saying?\nThe God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris\nWe talk about sex, money and drugs\n(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know\nWhat it's about (Love and power)\nIt goes deeper than what you see on TV\nCome on\n\n[Verse 3: Killah Priest]\nBurning desire, ebony eyes\nPainted toenails, legacies die\nWomen by the well, Egyptian queens\nArabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing\nGraveyards filled with scarlet widows\nStabbed they husbands, sleeping on silk pillows\nBlood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes\nLambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats\nLike magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell\nTrapping they souls in realms\nBaptize them with Holy Water\nSpringing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters\nInterviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada\nA thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba\nHebrews flee to the hills of Masada\nFor the love of God, guns make a loud sound\nI'ma show you how thugs get down\nShootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down\nCursed nation, lost generation\nX-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers\nFallen angels from space intruders\nDying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint\nSee it in the pictures, read it, like the lost scriptures\nAbsorb it with your 100 proof liquor\n\n[Verse 4: Njeri Earth]\nHuh; I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly\nThreatening the lives of those who threaten me\nLessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory\nAs taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one\nI heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone\nOr else I die by the gun, my life has just begun\nThought I was living all along, but I was wrong\nThis long road I have to travel, in countless battles\nThese filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles\nKings, queens and pharaohs changed to cattle\nUnable to duck the Devil's arrow\nSinging that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow\nSuperstitions, horoscopes and tarots\n\u201cHark Heralds Angels\u201d and Christmas carols\nGraven images hang from the mantels\nMan-made slaves in modern day Babel\nBrought from Africa in golden robes and sandals\nBy wicked thieves and vandals\nWho manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles\nAnd rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles\nStole our golden sodas like some Arab camels\nWe gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo\nInto the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow\nWe were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal\nChildren of my grand-old-daddy have me\nIn mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bdda24520e7142d4154c6549b6d2d517.820x820x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
