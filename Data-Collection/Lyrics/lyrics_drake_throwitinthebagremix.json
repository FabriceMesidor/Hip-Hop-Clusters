them Fendi shoes (You know we had to go shopping one more time right, I think we forgot something haha)\nAll we do is shop until we drop\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop\nJust throw it in the bag\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups (Uh uh uh uh uh)\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)\nAll we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\n\nJust throw it in the bag\nIt's Mr.Throw it in the bag\nI just throw it in the bag\nI don't know how much it costs but I know this bitch is bad\nWalk up to that register like I didn't know it had a tag\nI'm no liar I don't front I'm a buy her what she wants\nCause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants\nIf my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants\nAnd she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want\nShe can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt\nYou can try it if you want but it's gon cost you\nBags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe\nShe can go to work or chill like a boss do\nThat nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you\nThey say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'\nI say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine\nYou niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine\nMy player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice\n\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes\nAll we do is shop until we drop (if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups (Uh uh uh uh uh)\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)\nAll we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag\n\nUhh Ahhh\nWe up in Barneys going dumb again\nEverytime we leave the manager say, \"come again\"\nHonestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend\nShe just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again\nIf the card declined you need to check that shit and run again\nThey don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in\nYeah, just fold some paper round the magnet\nAs soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag\nShe mature to say the least\nAnd if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease\nShe used to have a husband until she found out he cheats\nThen she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase\nShe got a condo with a view, a house with a pool\nHe son that's 26 but he just went to away to school\nShe always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby\nI hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy\nAnd I be spending all my lady chips\nShe got me feeling like my daddy back in 86\nYeah, she say that she lucky that she his\nNo, I m lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isss\n\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes\nAll we do is shop until we drop (if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups (Uh uh uh uh uh)\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)\nAll we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag\n\nShorty so nice, I don't mean polite\nWhen I say nice, I mean looking right\nAnd you can't put a price on something looking right\nIf they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like\nEverything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights\nIf I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light\nAnd it's on everything I got a crazy lady\nSo money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD\nLike Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing\nSupporting your woman goes beyond paying\nWatching me ball is like LeBron playing\nI'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in\nThey say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'\nI say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine\nYou niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine\nMy player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice\n\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes\nAll we do is shop until we drop (if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag\nShe all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups (Uh uh uh uh uh)\nGot no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes (Uh uh)\nAll we do is shop until we drop (I said if you get money, if you get money)\nAll all all all all we do is shop until we drop (if you get money)\nJust throw it in the bag", "image":
