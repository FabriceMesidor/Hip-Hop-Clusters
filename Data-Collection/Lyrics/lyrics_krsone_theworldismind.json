Tell me what you see outside there today\"\nThe patient by the window started saying\n\"I see people walking, talking, I see children playing\"\n\"Cars going by with the booming systems\"\nBut the patient by the wall could only lay and listen\nBedridden, he couldn't see it for himself\nBut the descriptions he was given was improving his health\nEveryday the patient by the window would say what he saw\nAnd everyday the patient by the wall wanted more\nBut what he wanted even more instead\nWas to be in the patient by the window's bed\nHe wanted the same bed that the patient had\nIf he could just exchange beds it would make him glad\nSo one day the patient by the window was gone\nAnd the patient by the wall knew something was wrong\nBut he still asked the nurse if he could be first\nTo get the bed by the window, and what's worse\nHe did get the bed by the window\nBut the shock instead was a wall full of brick stone\nNo cars, no people, no scenery\nNo light, no flowers, no greenery at all\nIt was like just a brick wall facing the window\nHe said to the nurse \"I was tricked, yo\"\nThe nurse said \"Tricked? You'll be fine\"\nBut a view of a brick wall he didn't have in mind\nAnd what really blew his mind\nIs when the nurse said, \"Cheer up\nThe previous patient, he was blind\"\nHe realized right at that time\nYou create your reality, the world is mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7b1daf2ed6f9ee66a79dbc610af91d7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
