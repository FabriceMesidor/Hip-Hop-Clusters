What is this receipt 4?\nBoy said, \"With Lasers you kinda stumbled some and you're only as good as your last record.\"\nI said, \"So I guess I'm only as good as being number 1!\"\nI asked him \"What's your success measurer? The message or the register?\nIn the end you got a win-win, only thing I lost is my competitors.\"\nHe said, \"Yeah but Lasers was your worst and nothing like ya first.\"\nI said, \"Well that's me vs. me and your growth is nothing like your birth.\"\nHe said, \"You're a lame dumbed down sellout only known for talking out your ass.\"\nI humbly nodded in agreement and asked 4 more ketchup in my bag\nI left thinking how I used to be in his shoes\nWriting verses flipping burgers\nNow I serve the world pearls from socio-political menus\nAnd how I could never back, only because I never left\nSo if you find a few diamonds in your sandwich then you know who was the chef\nA Rolex in your fries, a chain in your salad\nA range rover in your soup and a extra slice palace\nPeople, Friend of L-U-P-End cuz!\nG'night", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
