This bitch evaporated\nPussy and all just picked up and vacated\nAnd now I'm frustrated, \u2018cause my dick was unprotected\nAnd doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nThat's why I ain't got no time\nFor these games and stupid tricks\nOr these bitches on my dick\nThat's how dudes be gettin' sick\nThat's how dicks be gettin' drips\nFallin' victims to this shit\nFrom these bitches on our dicks\nFuckin' chickens with no ribs\nThat's why I ain't got no time\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nNow I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'\nSomeone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach\nAnd she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me\nTo throw her off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force\nAnd I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort\nBut what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?\nWasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?\nMan, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore\nWhat would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?\nShe's havin' another baby in a month and it's yours\nAnd you found it isn't, \u2018cause this bitch has been visitin'\nSomeone else and suckin' his dick and\nKissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan\nNow the plot is thickenin' worse\n\u2018Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse\nSo you're paranoid at every little cold that you get\nEver since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick\nSo you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it\nThen the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace\nAnd it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS\nHe ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it\nSo you jet back home, \u2018cause you gon' get that ho\nWhen you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo\n\u2018Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow\nObie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?\nJesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's\nBringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis\nShe's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nThat's why I ain't got no time\nFor these games and stupid tricks\nOr these bitches on my dick\nThat's how dudes be gettin' sick\nThat's how dicks be gettin' drips\nFallin' victims to this shit\nFrom these bitches on our dicks\nFuckin' chickens with no ribs\nThat's why I ain't got no time\n\n[Outro: Eminem & Obie Trice]\nI'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!\nFuck 'em all!\nGet money, Shady Records\nHa, whoa!\nObie Trice!
