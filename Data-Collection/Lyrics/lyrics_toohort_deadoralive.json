Well I got more\nI take you on a trip to my rappin' store\nYou find rhymes and raps, poems and caps\nWay more raps than any rapper could rap\nCause if you rap like me, he wouldn't have to be\nWeak on the mic like my boy MC\nIt don't stop, to the funky beat\nI know you like dancing with a real big freak\nI can't dance, but I sure can rhyme\nI sold a million, in '89\nAnd if you didn't know baby, it's the 90's now\nOld Short Dog got a new breakdown\nI went to Miko's, fresh candy paint\nNow I'm doing things that the suckers can't\nIf I was dead, they'd call it \"Dead Man's Rap\"\nBut on the real, Short Dog is back\n\nFunk funky, off the Parliament\nI'm still living, so let's do it again\nIt's incredible, even if I die\nI never let 'em bury me without my mic\nI bring a new meaning, to underground rap\nDead or alive, I'm still Born to Mack\nI say \"What's up\" to my homies in Santa Rita\nRight about now I know you need a\nToo $hort rhyme to get you through the day\nOaktown style is the only way\nI came up, and now I've sworn\nTo rock this mic til I can't no more\nAnd that's game, straight pop the most\nMC rapper from the West Coast\nToo $hort, dead or alive\nI still chill on the Eastside\nCause I remember how it all began\nHouse parties in East Oakland\nNow it's on the pop charts, still rapping\nI'm not dead, I'm just macking", "image": "https://images.genius.com/354fed0b5f5b1d6e18186fae903238d6.930x927x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
