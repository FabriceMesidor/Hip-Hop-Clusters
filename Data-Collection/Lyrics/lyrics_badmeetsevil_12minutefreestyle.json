We'll be waiting on eight corners\nSwarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders\nI'll hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you\nAnd bombard you in the car that your mom bought you\nFuck around and get choked and found in a moat\nFloating around, drowned, faced-down in a boat\nI'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull-up to the Seven Mile drive through\nAt McDonald's and pile-drive you\nI got the power to snatch a driver out of his Eddie Bauer\nWhen it drives by me at 90 miles an hour\nThis place is my house\nI might as well erase my face with white-out\nCause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\nWalking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood\nShove a gun in the mouth of a thug\nTo break braces, you say grace and make faces\nI'll display hate and break you in eight places\nTake paces, turn around draw in a standoff\nPrecise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off\nDancing with the Devil leading - I won't die, I'm never leaving\nI pledge allegiance to forever breathing\nStreet niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger\nFake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers\nWith a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with\nLet the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace\nFor instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil\nA follower never had heart, he just loyal\nThugs is glass doors, I see through them, put the heat to them\nBe careful you might get what you ask for\nThat's what you false ballers get mugged and gagged for\nYour life flashing in front of your eyes in fast forward\nDearly departed, I don't even listen to artists\nI'm pissing the farthest, and I'm also hitting the hardest\nI'm very intelligent\nCompare me to cameras\nI flash, and shoot what I see, and steady developing\nI fly you out of your whip with one try of the trigger\nOut of your clique, ain't one nigga out of his shit\nYou gotta be kidding, bring all of them niggas\nThey all gotta be hit quick, and they all gotta be hitten\nIt's not a game, and I ain't playing\nYo if I ain't lived it, did it, or seen it, then I ain't saying\nI put a hole right in your chest\nStick a knife in your soul\nThen take your life after taking your death\nI'm nice!\nThat ain't even counting the endless bars\nFriends with scars, wondering which Benz is ours\nPretending to ball could even be the ending of y'all\nThe minute you fall, my criminals will finish you off\nI argue with no one\nYou got a gun?
