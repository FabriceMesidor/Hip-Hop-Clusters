Jakes\nBitches fuck with me they know that I'm straight\nAnd the plug give me cakes on strength of my face\nCount to save a ho go put on your cape\nI fucked her in the face and put her in place\nIm good anywhere for you its not safe\nAnd I keep a big pistol right on my waist\nSipping on lean then drunk me two Ace\nWhole sixteen I can't feel my face\nAnd they just let me out, murder was the case\nHad a shiny suit on like Puffy and Ma$e\n\n[Hook: x4]\nFace card, face card\nWhy use your bank card when you can use your face card?!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acd9babb757092a69a2f3c9e7eb4a9ad.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
