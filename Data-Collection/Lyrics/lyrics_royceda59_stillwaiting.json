Now of you who got the back of\nWho the fuck want it, bro? I got the scolio\nY'all niggas be wanting too much dough, slow your roll\nI don't know how much I'll loan ya, I'm not OVO\nWoah, for those who try to live the rough life\nPistol through your clothes, slugs ripping through your cashmere\nGive a nigga a buck 50 like I'm the cashier\nLeave us left for the beef, resting in peace, you tough, right?\nI'll punch a nigga to Timbuktu\nI got a drum, I'll front a nigga ten bucks too\nThe outcome of playing big bank to little bank with me\nWill prolly be a hundred thousand in ten bucks too\nUh, y'all lonely savage on the mollies acting like your life is violent\nI'm catapulting bodies, catching 'em like a virus\nTry to violate me, my ETA is a major scene\nAnd it will be the day, it will be the GTA \"wasted\" screen\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm still waiting on you\nYes, I'm\nI'm still waiting on you\nYes, I'm\nI'm still waiting on you\nYes, I'm\nI'm still waiting on you, you, you\nTaking it back just like that\n\n[Verse 2: Nick Grant]\nI could tell by your dress code you extra hoe\nI guess the rap game's 'bout who flex the most\nAll these funny niggas with cloudy jewelry at these award shows\nWas never rich, but dropping gems to poor souls\nTap a super model, she bound to need Morse code\nScreaming with my head in her box, it ain't a Vogue pose\nGod's favorite, a public enemy, love my women in all flavors\nIf I made it, we all made it\n'Pac reincarnated, spitting on cam, fuck 'em\nBut I'm just me, I never claim to be the toughest\nAin't gotta tell fake dope stories for you to love 'em\nBlood rushing like when a Russian, is hugging a Kalashnikov\nBusting, cousin used to tease me, call me crack baby\nTell 'em nothing changed, still dope, baby\nLately, I ain't for the monkey shit\nShooters with banana clips, dumping 'em\nCatching 'em slipping and peel 'em up at the family function and\nTell me who I'm up against, I run this shit\nNigga, the only thing could kill a legend is a double dish\nRide on 'em, me and Nickel Nine on-a ya\nYou know I snuck the thing in this bitch just like a foreigner\nPay no mind, it's no biggy, but shit I'm warning ya\nThe way I ball gon' make a nigga cornier\nTell the coroners \"come\", baby, there's been a murder\nNever was underrated, nigga, I'm unheard of\nYou outta line like you ain't got a lotta drive\nFuck around and clash with some niggas you idolized\nBottom line, I'm a man with a lot of pride\nGot my mama's eyes\nFrom the ghetto, I'm traumatized, where I lie confined\nAs I watch my demons m\u00e9nage screaming \"I'm alive\"\nLife is a freak, I put faith is this lady marmalade\nI just sign on the dotted line\nIt's for rappers who look like they get sodomized, you outta time\n\n[Chorus]\nJust like that, that, that, that\nThat\n\n[Verse 3: Elzhi]\nI'm poisonous pesticide, extra wide nostrils\nHostile infects aside, it's the chainsaw massacre\nTexas side in a Lexus fried doing donuts\nAs if I grabbed the coffee with it for breakfast\nThis shit I write it make you ball up your fist to fight and\nTake off on a nigga, make him think he missed a flight\nSo you shouldn't ignore me then, I can trade lines with Scorpion\nOr pretend I'm not Kevorkian, just his dorky twin\nAnd I ain't got a lock when I'm sticking the door key in\nCause I got this in the bag like apartment 4B when\nJigga was a hustler who later wrote about it on the intro\nTo In My Lifetime, and you's a customer\nNot accustomed to how I'm on the cusp of greatness\nAnd at the top of the food chain, I could hump the waitress and\nHow you do these dishes? I'm truly vicious\nI know you wish my life sucked and Death blew me kisses\nBut I'm extra closer to the Testarossa\nThe best, supposed to make you sick to your stomach till you possess an ulcer\nYou know my reputation, who in yo' camp wanna step to Jason?\nA sick disease that cut into you like six degrees of separation\nYou'll find it's more lines in this rhyme than a brick of ki's\nThat any crime unit would be quick to seize\nFrom some high rollers who are thick as thieves\nWho love the top dog and how he flick his fleas\nAnd I could give you food for thought before fricassee's\nOr I can just rub you out like two crickets' knees\nThey rather see me chatching murder charges\n'stead of Jamaica at the SPA on my third massage\nLiving the life that's in need of a narration\nGive me the spotlight, you can keep the interrogation\nAt the sheriff station\nAnd I swear if you tryna play the don\nThink before you dive in murky waters with a megalodon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2627cc5445030d64606928667383564b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
