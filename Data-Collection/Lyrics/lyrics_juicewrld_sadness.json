I'm just kidding\nBack to the main focus, I think that you\u2019re gorgeous\nYou love the way that I stroke it, signing my name on your neck\nYou use to make potions, play around with witchcraft\nI wonder if you put that in my lean and I drank that\n\n[Chorus]\nOur eyes locked, you can see the sadness\nMy heart stops, every time you call my name\nMy jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck\nYou fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?\nWe\u2019re down, we\u2019re sad, is it my fault?\nI apologize for all of the lies, oh\nI won\u2019t, treat you like the rest of those guys, oh\n\n[Bridge]\nWe met in a Twilight Zone\nI fall apart, but you keep me whole\nWe met on the West Coast\nBut i still see Miami in your soul\n\n[Chorus]\nOur eyes locked, you can see the sadness\nMy heart stops, every time you call my name\nMy jaw drops, you fell from the stars and I'm starstruck\nYou fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?\nWe\u2019re down, we're sad, is it my fault?\nI apologize for all of the lies, oh\nI won\u2019t, treat you like the rest of those guys, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
