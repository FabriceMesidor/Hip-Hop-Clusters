How did they know?\nSixteen years later, here I go\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal\nG Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill\nBut Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted\nClark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us\nRussell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted\nReef and Matty C offered me a little money\nShit a little funny, feel a little laughter\nRebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper\nMy boy MC Serch, nevertheless\nTook me to Columbia, back then CBS\nChris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man\nNow buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam\nCould you picture Russell needin' a check, man?\nBut he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram\nLife is ill, again life's a movie\nThen the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees\nBefore I sold records, no promotion\nThe rap world like, \"What's all this commotion?\"\nWent plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'\n20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nInvincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh\nUh, but back to the matter at hand\n\u2018Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25\nSome cats didn't make it alive\nDated some stars but respect their privacy\nCopped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat\nHeld myself down, just steerin' the wheel\nHere I am, completed my whole record deal\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Russell]\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\n[Outro]\nWhat would I do\nIf I could reach inside of me\nAnd to know how it feels\nTo say I like what I see?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/038790d40d68aaf12c0d9698f2196a23.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
