I got no trust\nAnd I be B.M.F.'n, a million won't last a month\nAll I need is one, P.N.C. and that's enough\nAnd I ain't even crank up yet, but bet I'm gassing up\nWhen my Prada press that peddle bitch you better fasten up\nI exhale and ash the blunt, inhale a hundred times\nThat even one hundred-one couldn't bring back how it was\nWhen a brick was seventeen and you ain't have to rob your plug\nWhen rapping was an art, now the shit a joke\nBet you couple dollars, few jewels, and some pussy\nI'm getting a little too power drunk, now I'm on that bullshit\n\n[Hook]\nI got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand\nTrying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand\nThat's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash\nThat's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash\nI got a problem and a plan, revolver in my hand\nTrying to keep it cold, but y'all won't understand\nThat's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash\nThat's why I roll, that's why I roll with the Bible on the dash\n\n[Verse 2]\nCutting corner on Corona's, trying to buck up on a bonus\nOut here on my lonely, last stogie but I'm focused\nNow I know, friends parallel to foe\nAnd all that good pussy leave you parallel to broke\nI asked the pastor, what's the fastest way to heaven for a bastard with a tarnished past, give me your honest answer\nWith all this Hannah Montana, without the Arm and Hammer\nAm I going to get the slammer or the casket\nTrying to keep a level head, rolling on this rocky road\nThis a full time gig, trying to keep this Glock cold\nGot the work, water in the pot, need a hot stove\nAnd a down ass bitch, and a squad down to roll\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3dce21029cdd8aab73eb473e015807d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
