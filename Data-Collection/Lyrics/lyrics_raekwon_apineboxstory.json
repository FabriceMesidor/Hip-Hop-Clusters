Snatched the reefer\nThat bitch is next, catch you on the sequel\nSwollen eyes, his face was pulverized\nTrying to be a hustler, two ounces he want to mobilize\nDumb dummy, no team, he barely had money\nFlying around, old ass Jag, buying blow from me\nSki mask robbing, jean wearing ho sweetass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13dc7ae0ba0ca43b8df35ea276a05728.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
