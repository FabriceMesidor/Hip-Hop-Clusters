Simpson and I just stab out\nWhy did you enter? You didn't comprehend\nSee this is a battle for MCs who think they might win\nBut fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets\n'Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat\nNow you can go get your crew ? you now\n? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out\nClaiming you jumped out bitch\nNigga we bust in the bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller\nNever spent nothing more, nothing less\nThe first single that you drop is \"I wanna be fresh\"\n\n[Eminem]\nAny rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes\nIn this day and age, in this period of time\nTrying to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr\nTrying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat and Bizarre\n? that's why you beg to differ me\nYou ain't got no style plus you lack delivery\nNot to brag, I don't mean to boast\nLook, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost\nYou're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone\nIf I put banana peels around this fucking microphone\nSo get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top\nAnd take this building down 'cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
