Uh, real quick, you got a mixtape coming out called Fuck Em We Ball, I'm just curious to know why you ain't put my nigga Droppa on there? Like as if you don't know what he is and what he's about. Man, it took a lot for me to get him not to call you right now. You know, he called me to facilitate the situation so I'm tryin' to but this is tough man. I mean you do, you do a mixtape without the realest dude in the game. Kinda makes me think like, like are you afraid of Droppa's success? Dude, we gotta talk man, like this is crazy and I just hope it ain't that man' cause I would hate for Drop to have to get serious and come looking for you. As somebody who knows him and knows what he's capable of I suggest you take this as a warning dude. You either put Droppa on your side or you go down... just like the rest of 'em. I'm just tryna be your friend man. Bye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c15dbab29cd7e31286511ae5be6d5fed.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
