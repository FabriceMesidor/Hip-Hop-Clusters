Sold, when they dropped from the label\nAll the money they gave you made you very unstable\nThey really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal\nTo see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle\nYou a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C\nMeaning: Most Confused\nNot E-M-C-E-E, that's what I use\nMany people really wanna know from me\nWhen I'mma drop and they can go cop, the next LP\nOr CD, or T-A-P-E you see\nIt's about word of mouth, for me\n\nWe crush, them, and they click\nLet me tell you right now what you supposed to get\nYou supposed to get free and intelligent\nNot a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant\nWe CRUSH, THEM, and they rap\nYo, they don't really know where the money is at\nAnd what's funny is that, is if you'd just stay focused\nThey'd be the one to be the brokest!\nI'm from the inner city, that's right\nFlashy asses and titties that's right\nNo pity mad graffiti that's right\nBroken gang treaties, that's real\nI speak complete broken slang freely at will\nI spit what I'm about to spit, get what I'm about to get\nNever no counterfeit, movin about a bit\nKnowledge Reigns Supreme, only a few like the sound of it\nOthers can't get down with it (ONE..
