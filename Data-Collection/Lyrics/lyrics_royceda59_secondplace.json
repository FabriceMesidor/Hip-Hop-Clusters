You gon' need an underground bunker\nI aim where you should go\nI put my whole life on the net, even my weapons\nI am Bazooka Joe, ugh\nWe the shit, nigga eat a dick\nWe'll make him eat his words, we the stones, he the sticks\nI'm going yelling Shady everywhere\nSmacking niggas' bitches with they lipstick and they baby with they teddy bear\nTo you and your man: ain't gon' be no Talladega Night\nI come to question y'all and y'all don't know what to do with your hands\nNickle Preme, killer team\nAt a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend\n\n[Chorus]\nI come to embarrass y'all rappers\nI should run a marathon backwards\nSo I could see what second place look like\n(Too many sick niggas, Nickel bring the remedy)\n(Make it real clear)\nI come to embarrass y'all rappers\nI should run a marathon backwards\nSo I could see what second place look like\n(You not ready for the raw deal, it's all real, kiss the ring, be gone!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0400a9a36500f68a15def09fbe59a648.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
