Blige\nWe live a life apart, life so hard\nLife'll never really end up like the start\nWe learn together how the back door feels\nAnd we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields\nWe was the same, all black folks still\nUntil the white man found out black votes steal elections\nSo they legitimized us, but behind us\nIt's still black folks at the back door still\nFor every small increment liberated, our women waited\nAnd all they privacy been invaded\nAlmost every trade I got through the slave owner\nDark skin, brown, nose round, but the Bennett made it\nNow I wanna give it to her, Sierra Leone, serenade\nSometimes love come with its own barricade\nSometimes love just gotta hold, marinate\nLet it hold, let it wait, here it go, here it go\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's possible (It's possible)\nIt's possible (It's possible)\n(Vous allez accomplir, vous allez accomplir, allez)\nIt's possible (Tu t'a grand\u00e9)\nIt's possible (Tu t'a grand\u00e9)\nIt's possible\nIt's possible\n\n[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]\nAyy, yo\nOnce upon a time, a girl from Trinidad\nHad to fly to Canada and sneak into the land\nOf the free and of the brave, feet under the sand\nAnd I came in realizing nothing free in the land\nDreams of making money, had to split it with Sam\nAll that Making the Band, yeah, I could've did it, but damn\nHad to really be on the come-up, had to stick to the plan\nWent from rockin' with Fendi, now Fendi know I'm a brand\nThat's how God do, I'm in your top two\nAnd I ain't number two, conquered rap, then the pop too\nYou gon' stop who? Get off cock, boo\nSince \"Itty Bitty Piggy,\" giving bitches what they bop to\nI met my husband when I was 17 out in Queens\nIf you love it, let it go, now I know what that means\nWhile he was up North for a body\nI bodied everybody and got known for my body\nMy nigga home now, he the Clyde to my Bonnie\n'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy\nOoh, I remember when I cried like, \"Why me?\"\nNow I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani\nSometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me\nGotta remember who I am when it slips me\nKids running up to the car yelling, \"Nicki\"\nAll my bad bitches, I know that y'all with me\nFuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?\nGot a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep\nGot some killers that'll put you on ice, so don't sleep\n'Bout to dead this whole beef and rock some gold teeth\n\n[Outro: Nicki Minaj]\nIt's possible, it's possible\nIt's possible to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/102754ce389c900531057dd11508c674.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
