But I found out she was insatiable\nShe wanted me to do her too\nDon't want to see me through her view\n'Cause I got on my knees and started doin' my deed\nBut then I accidentally chewed her through\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanna be a normal boy\nJust wanna be a normal boy\nIf I could be good and just\nKeep the women off my tongue\nThen she can be my number one\nLady!\nI just wanna be a normal boy\nJust wanna be a normal boy\nIf I could be good and just\nKeep the women off my tongue\nThen she can be my number one\nLady! Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de5c12836aa9b9bbb55356aafbf1fa0a.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
