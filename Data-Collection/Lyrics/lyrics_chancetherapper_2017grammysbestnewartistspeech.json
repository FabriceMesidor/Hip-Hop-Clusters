I want to thank God for my mother and my father who've supported me since I was young. For Kiersten, for Kinsley, for all of Chicago. And I wanna thank God for putting amazing people in my life like Pete and Pat who have carried me since 2012. I know a lot of times I talk about my independence and people think it had something to do with... oh I'ma talk, y'all can play the music if you want. I wanna thank God for my team. I know people think that independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom. I do it with these folks right here.  Glory be to God, I claim the victory in the name of the Lord, let's go!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db1a9643a028d62543e44c90da3a6ad.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
