What?\nWe right here\nWe're not goin' anywhere\nWe right here\nThis is ours and we don't share\nWe right here\nBring your crew, 'cause we don't care\nWe right here, uh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 1]\nOne mo' time, I gots to hit the streets off\nMake the streets talk, let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk\nThis gon' be\nThe only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003\nAnd y'all gon' see\nThat the hottest nigga out there was, is and will be me\nJust like that, I can go away for a minute\nDo some other shit, but bounce right back\nAnd when it's on, I'm coming strapped\nWith some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn\nAnd when you gone, ain't no coming back in the morn\nYou think that shit was a dream, nigga? You gone!\nThat's for real; creep niggas like a SEAL\nToting steel, stick a nigga, make him squeal\n\"Oh, my God!\" Those can't be the last words of your man\nDamn, your man was so hard; come on!\n\n[Chorus]\nBring it! What?\nWe right here\nWe're not goin' anywhere\nWe right here\nThis is ours and we don't share\nWe right here\nBring your crew, 'cause we don't care\nWe right here, uh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere we go again; how many million did my last one sell?\nFuck it, I'm going for ten!\nThis never gon' stop, and every fuckin' time I hit you\nIt's going straight to the top of the charts\nThe champion, I'm a thoroughbred, my blood is strong\nAnd I scratch 'til you done\nCross the line, and ain't no more scratches after that\nStraight up, niggas is dyin'\nYo, what the fuck is you cats doing\nRunning around like this, like you won't get stuck?!\nYo, that's my word\nI stay givin' it to niggas, and I stay not really being heard\nBut, y'all gon' see\nThat the same things thou did to them, will be done to thee\nAnd then you'll know, that sometimes though you come through the front, you leavin' out the backdoor; come on!\n\n[Chorus]\nBring it! What?\nWe right here\nWe're not goin' anywhere\nWe right here\nThis is ours and we don't share\nWe right here\nBring your crew, 'cause we don't care\nWe right here, uh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse 3]\nBring the noise\nAnd you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about\n'Cause you gon' lose your boys\n'Cause we don't play, and the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin' to say\nDog for life, whether I'm on or off the leash, I bite\nStreets are my life\nClick click boom! {*gunshot*}\nAnother life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral\nStill waters run deep\nAnd the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep\nBut I keep goin', goin'\nShit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'\nThe dog gon' live\nStay walkin' the wire, over the fire, when I can I give\nThe dog is good, and how it's stayin'\nDog gon' fuck with the hood, the dog fuck with the wood\n\n[Chorus]\nBring it!
