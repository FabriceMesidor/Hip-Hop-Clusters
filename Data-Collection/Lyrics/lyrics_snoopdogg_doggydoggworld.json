Why ask why?\nAs the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y\n\n[Chorus: The Dramatics & Nancy Fletcher]\nIt's a crazy, mixed-up world\nIt's a Doggy Dogg World\n\n[Verse 2 - Kurupt]\nWell if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10\nSeen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin\nDon't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers\nStyles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers\nAin't that something?\nTalk shit and I'm dumpin'\nI had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'\nDon't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China\nYou'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya\nSo peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through\n1, 2, 3: you can't see me\nI'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics\nA fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets\nIt's on again, It's on and poppin'\nAll I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'\nI wanna see some panties droppin'\nI'm coming from L.A\nShe used to chill with Dre up in Compton\n(All I ever did was just use that ho\nShow her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)\nI\u2019m dishin out blues, I\u2019m upsettin' like bad news\nCut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes\nKurupt, the name\u2019s often marked for catchin' slugs\nAnd I smoke weed for the fuck of it\nRuff and rugged shit, it\u2019s unexplanatory how I gets wicked\nBut it\u2019s mandatory that I kick it\nCheck it, I\u2019m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it\nHoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'\nPrepare for a war, it\u2019s on, I\u2019m head huntin'\nHit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn\nPeep, the massacre from a verbal assassin\nMurderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9\u2019s for some action\nYou really don\u2019t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog\nYou can\u2019t do me, I\u2019m goin' out looney like O-Dog\n\n[Chorus: The Dramatics & Nancy Fletcher]\nIt's a crazy, mixed-up world\nIt's a Doggy Dogg World\n\n[Daz Dillinger]\nTha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)\nTil when? (Til the early morn')\nAnd it don't stop, and it don't quit\nFor tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough\n\n[Verse 3 - Daz]\nDiggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once more\nSo grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow\nI flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick\nTil I die, I'm still screaming out: \"bitches ain't shit!\"\nNow I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about\nThe city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum\nAs you groove to the gangster shit\nThe D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D\nThe gangster clique\nNow as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk\nI can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want\nThen I blaze up the chronic so I can get high\nI promise I smoke chronic til the day that I die\n\n[Chorus: The Dramatics & Nancy Fletcher]\nIt's a crazy, mixed-up world\nIt's a Doggy Dogg World", "image": "https://images.genius.com/291a4bae4730034f4a529b0498c6f71f.480x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
