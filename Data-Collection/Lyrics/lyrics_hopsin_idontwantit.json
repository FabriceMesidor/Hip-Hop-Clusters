All of it dealt with spending my paper\nAnd I was nice, I'd give 'em cash, I'd show sympathy\nI gave him some, him, and her, I'm just lending cheese\nNow I'm just looked at like an ATM machine\nIf I don't give my friends my money, shit, I'm the enemy\nI had about a million new best friends that I just met\nSome were plotting to build me a death bed\nAll because they kept on putting wack songs out that no one's impressed with\nSo out of jealousy they'd diss me, you fucking guessed it (Ha)\nAt least I had my squad; Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz\nI knew we'd stick together, stuck in this chaotic biz\nWe had it all figured out and had a lot to give\nIt was Funk Volume for life, who want a problem, bitch?\nThen all the sudden, out of nowhere we parted ways\n2016 \u2013 those were some of my darkest days\nAsk us all, \"Whose fault was it?\" Ain't hard to say\nBut it was due to money and all of our bonds had started to fade\nMonths later, my girl told me she's pregnant\nThis was something I never expected\nHer and I weren't on good terms at the time, man, it was hectic\nAnd I was scared if she kept this baby I might regret it\nMainly because her and I had a fucking toxic relationship\nLast thing we need is a fucking toddler to raise in it\nHaving a baby is great, but not as amazing when you got two parents who always fighting, hollering, breaking shit\nPresent day, all my people are gone\nNo real friends, just leeches around eating the crumbs\nNo family bonds, no FV, can't be with my son\nNo fucking girlfriend, I swear I thought that she was the one\nI feel alone and I struggle to get my fans what they want from me\nI'm struggling to build this UP company\nI'm begging on my fucking knees like, \"God, please help me 'cause I can't fucking breathe\nI'm tryna smile, but pain is cutting deep\nShow me that I'm more than just a rapper\nShow me that this life that I've been working on is meant to be more than just a disaster\"\nI hope this message I'm sending is floating up above\nInstead of focusing on fame, I should've focused on the love\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more\n(No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\nI don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more\n(No more)\nNo more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)\n\n[Outro]\nI gotta go find myself\nI hope you all can understand", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97d775c3b39a993d19dfdf1aa998512f.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
