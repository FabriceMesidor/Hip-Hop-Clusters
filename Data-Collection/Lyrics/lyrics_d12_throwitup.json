Tech Nine... Shots rang out...\nIt's christmas time, my kid needs some toys\nThats why I'm in the Mini-van, with two of my boys\nThe King, Nigga I'm a don....\nDetroit...Where niggas snatch cartneys and alcazon...\nI'm drunk as fuck, go on lock me out\n...and when I wake up, I'll be at your house choking you out\nI'm so fucking, out of my mind\nI'm moving the east swines with 2 and a half lines\nStreet wars, my niggas ready to fight\nGuns, pipes, we ready tonight!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d38fa240d684e57a565427318ace6fee.706x706x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
