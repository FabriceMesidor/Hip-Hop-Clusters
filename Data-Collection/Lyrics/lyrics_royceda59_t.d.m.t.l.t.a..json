Just get 'em on the phone\nTell him I don't want much\nI just want to tell him that I plan to come and kill him\nI'm a probably talk to him soft like Liam Neeson\nLike I'm bein' decent\nI'm PRhyme, I'm Slaughterhouse, I'm BME\nI'm sort of like 'Pac in the vest, I got no fear in me\nCause I done been to hell and back so many times\nThat I think I'd seen the smile on the face of the reaper\nSo don't waste your time prayin' to your creator\nToo late, he can't make ya like me, bruh\n\n[Chorus]\nNah, they don't make 'em like this no more\nThat's opportunity knockin'\nI'm standin' there like this your door\nTo say to them that they don't make 'em like this no more\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis ain't the standard ops you niggas done ran across\nI'll send my little man across the street\nHe'll stop squeezin' 'til somethin' pops into your head\nLike a random thought, I don't care for drama\nI'd rather terrorize you, chase you 'round your city\nLike you Sarah Connor and I'm the Terminator\nI'm wearin' Ferragamo the same time that the devil's wearin' Prada\nWhy would you and I compare albums?\nI got your life in the palm of my hands\nLayin' it down is all I'm thinkin' 'bout\nAnd newsflash, niggas is frauds, it's all an act\nWhen he tough wit' the talk\nHe don't go out in traffic, he know I'll slap him\nHe know I'll snatch him out of that box he lives in he calls Abby\nYou know I'll stuff him back in that box\nThat I put niggas in called casket\nIt ain't nothin' to squash, don't call my line wit' that wack shit\nYou want to get to the bottom of that? Call catfish\nNow let me get back to what I was doin'\nThis hundred-round drum turns around time in mixed months\nSame Valentine's day massacre, March Madness\nWrapped in a big blunt, let's smoke the niggas who really live it\nWho know what beef really is and don't speak if it really isn't\nGot niggas doin' life in the prison on the iPhone and the corrlinks\nAnd I live in the no-fly zone\nAnd more digits is all that I got my eyes on\nI see you clowns through the eyes of the Lord\nI'm lookin' down knowin' I'll be around for your rise and your fall\nYou rhyme, what's more mind-blowin' than a 9 to your jaw?\nEven a weak flow could be nice\nI'm takin' penitentiary chances\nWe roll the dice like the Migos in Vice\nYou want these hoes and likes\nMe? I'm the one there'll be no one like", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/eefd9f831b681a8540aa8c915adbfc10.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
