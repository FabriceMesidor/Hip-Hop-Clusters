Shit is really based on politics, man\n\nYeah, they were right when we was in the street, huh?\n\nYou need some tissue, man?\n\nYeah\n\nShit is just real right now because, yo, everything count man. Everywhere you walk, a nigga gon' judge your walk. But only you can judge yourself at the end of the day, knowin' what the fuck is you doin'. A lot of niggas gotta see that man, immobilizing is the best thing right now coming from whatever we came out of, you know?\n\nYeah, but they don't make cats like you no more, baby. It's a different breed out here, know what I'm sayin'?\n\nIndeed so\n\nThe world is yours though, baby. The world is yours\n\nWe got a plan though\n\nThe world is yours\n\nWe have no interests, no investments in anything illegitimate. Don't ever underestimate the power of forgiveness. This is real shit right here, I'm tellin' you\n\nMr. Raekwon and his associates is prepared to deposit 500 million dollars in the Rap Vatican bank.

I have a board I have to answer to, they have to approve you\n\nJust when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d8508796401925d32124cc47a45641d8.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
