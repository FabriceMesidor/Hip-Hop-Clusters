And uh, it's like of my wedding, but nothing is going right. Everything's a disaster. My guests are all there, it's all of my real life friends. They all look gorgeous. They're all like fully done up in their gowns that they're probably going to wear to the wedding, my family is there. But suddenly I realize I should've been married by now, and I'm not married, I'm not in my wedding dress. I'm all alone, in this giant area where I see my guests being served their cocktail appetizers off of paper plates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, but they're eating off of paper plates. But I am wearing cargo pants. Army cargo pants\n\nDONALD\nLike Old Navy?\n\nDANIELLE\nYeah, exactly. Like Old Navy cargo pants. I don't own Old Navy cargo pants. I'm not even sure where that came from in my head, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm supposed to be getting married. My hair's not done, my makeup's not done. And my mom comes in and asks me, \"Why aren't you getting ready for your wedding?\" And I'm like \"Oh, I will be, I will be\" but suddenly I'm smoking a cigarette, I even don't know why I'm smoking a cigarette, but in my mind I also that I'm three or four weeks pregnant. Horrible, right? So I tell my mom, \"Mom, you don't know this, but I'm three or four weeks pregnant\" and she says not \"Put down the cigarette\", she says, \"Maybe you should get into your wedding dress\". It's all very, very weird. I'm not sure what it means at all\n\nDONALD\nI think we have too many lemons\n\nDANIELLE\nOne more?\n\nDONALD\nYeah\n\nDANIELLE\nAnd these two\n\nDONALD\nYeah, some of them.

MOVIE ROOM. - NIGHT\n\nDONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses they've written\n\nFLYING LOTUS\n\nInvesting time on writing lies, slightly truth without a clue\nI met my higher self, pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs\nHe said \"keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth\"\nAnd all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth\nI'm an angel in an agony of flame\nFeathers growing at the mention of my name, reinvention of my shame\nI'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave\nAnd all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave, nigga\nDance around the camp fire, buttnaked, blowing trees\nCould give a single fuck if somebody sees, I'm free\nRed \"V\" bleed out a scarlet letter, kill a king\nAnd I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing\nPicking up expensive habits, chasing after little rabbits\nHope they lead me to a place of magic\nSad at all the times I never thought I had it\nLosing all these memories, and y'all doubt it matters...\nPatterns\n\nDONALD\nMouth to a Pellegrino, bottle color of envy\nWho the fuck is Gambino, I hand a waitress a benji\nTo act like she never met me, I'm saying though\nThey want the game changed when your shit on the radio\nFruit was so hanging low, I didn't even bother\nShe tryna land Obama's, man she get it from her mama\nI don't blame her, I tame her, give her something to visualize\nOn my couch watching DVR'd \"American Dad\"\nMan those new Celine bags are so to die for\nI'm in that Porsche on Prozac, them suicide doors\nWatch her walk as the death becomes her\nCause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills, no wonder\nMy heaven is the present, so maybe this is it.\nPray to God every night to make me believe he exists\nDrink a fifth of vodka, I don't need no sponsor,\nHeard a preacher holler, make him hold these souls\n\nAnd that's when like the hook...\n\nFLYING LOTUS\nYeah that's tight. I like that\n\nYou know you got a little...\n\nHe points to DONALD's nose, and DONALD touches it to find blood dripping\n\nDONALD\nOh shit\n\nFLYING LOTUS\nYeah\n\nDONALD gets up, and runs to the bathroom\n\nFLYING LOTUS(CONT'D)\nWow\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nDONALD examines his nose in the mirror, surprised by the bleeding\n\nHe looks for the source of all the blood, and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage- it's a string\n\nNauseated and scared, he pulls the long, blood soaked string while gagging and coughing. Finally, he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end, a golden tooth\n\nHe places it next to the sink and washes his hands, as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower\n\nHe is still, and his back is to us\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT\n\nDONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire, eating s'mores and swapping childhood stories\n\nFAM\nI remember being seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school. Had a lot of girls, it's crazy. So, this one girl, she was super crazy, she would call my phone from a blocked number, and it was her. But then I started getting like the crazy death threats. Started as a joke, then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving, where I liked to hang out. Then they started shooting in the area, so I couldn't sleep at home anymore. Went and got a gun from my friend. Started sleeping on the street for a week. The scariest thing about it all though, is having a gun knowing you might have to use it. scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody. Sometimes you can't explain why things happen. Those seven days, man, just couldn't handle it. Just couldn't handle it. You just get to that point like why did I get here? Sometimes they just do\n\nDONALD\nWhen I was like five or six, we were living in Decatur, in the projects. On Commerce Drive. It's nice now, but like we were living there and I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of the family. This kid like... Something happened, I didn't understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day. I didn't really understand it. But we didn't have any space. So he had to sleep in my bed. I remember in the morning waking up and he was like \"Let's rub butts\". I was like \"okay\" like whatever I did it. And I didn't really get it. And then I turned, when we turned he kissed me\n\nFAM\nHe kissed you?\n\nDONALD\nYeah. Like you said, I don't know why it happened. I don't know why it happened\n\nFAM\nDid anybody like know about this?\n\nDONALD\nNah, just him\n\nFAM\nThat's wild\n\nDONALD\nIt's crazy\n\nFAM\nLike I said, sometimes you just can't explain things\n\nDONALD\nI'm gonna go inside\n\nFAM\nAlright, I gonna stay out here, man\n\nDONALD begins to walk inside as we...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nHALLWAY\n\nDONALD is walking to his room, as the GIRL passes him in the opposite direction\n\nHe turns, quizzically\n\nDONALD\nWho are you?\n\nShe doesn't respond, or even look at him, and keeps walking. Donald continues walking to his room\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. DONALD'S ROOM. - NIGHT\n\nHe is flying face up, eyes closed. The phone rings and he opens his eyes\n\nHe leans over and picks up the phone\n\nWOMAN (V.O.)\nHello, who's this?\n\nDONALD immediately hangs up, looks down for a moment, and takes off his sweatshirt and shirt\n\nHe lies down and falls back asleep\n\nFADE OUT", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b8c1f5981bc77ffd06580a1f2e693cf3.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
