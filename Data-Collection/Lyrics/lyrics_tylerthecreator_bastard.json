I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug hoy, I\u2019m bad for you kids to listen to\nSoy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it\n\n[Interlude: Dr. TC]\nWhoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say\nUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating\n\n[Verse 9]\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDripping cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing\nBut I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing\nWith a tear they try to tell me but I never listen\n'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing\nEighteen, still talking to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\n\n[Outro: Dr. TC]\nWow, umm, so Tyler if you had the chance to tell him something\nWhat would you tell him?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb0b25f99dd81109efa8db270a933a38.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
