I guess they I.D.\u200b\nBut they just let me in without it, so I guess they like me\nI put on my best dang white tee for the season's festivities\nAnd I even got it pressed and dry-cleaned\nIt's me and the rest of my heathens, we in the building\n'Til it closes, we're partying 'til then nobody knows that I'm drinking\nKeep my Bacardi concealed inside of my jacket\nWhen no one's looking, I tap the bottle, crack it, then swig it then put the frigging top back on it and cap it\nYeah, that same bullshit, man, I just got back on it, god dammit\nBoy, you don't want it, doggone it, that gin and tonic, I slam it\nAn alcoholic, I am what I am, that's all that I am\nAnd upon my further inspection, Monica's bra I examine\nAnd if you're wondering why I'm looking in awe as I am\nIt's 'cause I'm just so overjoyed to see people brawl to my jam\nAnd now let's go\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, Slim Shady, to the stage please\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nIf you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies\nAnd tell 'em, \"You just the hit the lottery, baby\"\nI said, \"Shady, to the stage please\"\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nWe heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies\nSay, \"You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, I hate it when no one's paying me any attention\nSo I won't let up 'til they do, I don't have any intention\nMa, I like your breast, but your booty's too skinny to pinch it\nHow is that possible with a waist on me about 26 inches?\nEase up on the Henny, just sip it\nThere's so many winches up in here that's got my interest\nI'm drenched in sweat down in the trenches\nContinue to make my way all the way to the center of the dance floor I've just entered\nHope that I don't get injured, oh, here I go\nI'm shaking my tail for the oh-so member\nOh, feet, don't fail me now\nBetter be nimble when you swoop this bimb' up\nGet the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up\nShady's Mercedes Benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling\nLike a gremlin with a head full of Red Bull at 12:15 AM and\nDude, I feel incredible, is medicine edible? You are unforgettable\nGirl, the fact we didn't meet sooner is the only thing that I think's regrettable\nLet me check my schedule (Shit)\nOh no, your phone number ain't even legible, this night's unmeasurable\nIt'd be my pleasure to introduce you to\n\n[Chorus]\nSlim Shady, to the stage please\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nIf you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies\nAnd tell 'em, \"You just the hit the lottery, baby\"\nI said, \"Shady, to the stage please\"\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nWe heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies\nSay, \"You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo when you come in the club, don't care if you paid or you snuck in\nSoon as you hear the beat drop, stop what you doing, start buckin'\nSo get up like you're up and, homie, get down like you're ducking\nUp like you're stuck in the air and down like you're down on your luck\nAnd not down like out, so just turn that frown upside down that you're stuck in\nThere's no upside when you're down\nThe only downside when you're up is being hungover\nSo, Shady, won't tell you 'em what's up?\nThen go get your cup and refill it\nNow speed it up a little bit and just kill it\nDon't stand there and look at my whip, chick, get in\nI ain't gotta tell you again, now close the door, you're lettin' flies in\nWhat? Am I supposed to be air conditioning the whole outside then?\nWould you look at what you're riding in?\nYou better take pride and stare at it for five minutes\nYou're lucky I didn't just drive by in it\nYou're privileged just to be inside of it\nI stepped in this party to liven it\nI just caught a vibe in it the minute that I arrived in it\nSo, ladies, where you at? Make some noise if you're likin' it\nThen tell your boyfriend to take a hike again\nTwo Heinekens and you're mine\nSo, Slim Shady, won't you please step to the mic again? (Come on)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, Slim Shady, to the stage please\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nIf you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies\nAnd tell 'em, \"You just the hit the lottery, baby\"\nI said, \"Shady, to the stage please\"\nOh, won't you please make the place go crazy?\nWe heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies\nSay, \"You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
