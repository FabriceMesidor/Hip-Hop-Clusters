Are you that rich?\nWhy you care if you scared of death? Are you that chick?\nDo you really think she gives a **** if you have kids?\nMan, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You\u2019re right)\nNot over this slit (Stop)\nDrop the biscuit (I will)\nDon\u2019t even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you\nYou know what, Dre? I don\u2019t like your attitude\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]\nThese voices, these voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I\u2019ll follow\n(All these voices, these voices) Meet Stan, 21 years old\nAfter meeting a young girl at a rave party (I hear them, hear them)\n(And when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow)\nThings start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom\n(I'll follow, I'll follow)\nOnce again, his conscience comes into play (All these)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nNow, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek\nAnd smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink\nNow all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe\nYo, this girl's only fifteen years old\nHow could you take advantage of her? She's passed out\nIt's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how\nThen pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch\nAnd leave her on the front porch at her mom and dad's house\nMan, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?\nNo, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)\nYou wanna get hauled off to jail?\nBump that, drop her off, ring the doorbell, then bail\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & Mark Avery]\nThese voices, these voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow\nMeet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker\n(All these voices, these voices)\nAfter coming home from a hard day's work (I hear them)\n(And when they talk, I'll follow)\nHe walks in the door of his trailer park home\n(I'll follow, I'll follow)\nTo find his wife in bed with another man (I'll follow all these)\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]\nAlright, calm down, relax, start breathin'\nStart breathin'? Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'\nWhile you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off\nForget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off\nWait, what if there's a good explanation for this?\nWhat, she tripped, fell, landed on his ****?\nTsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\nOkay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?\nKick her our the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?\nWhat you say?\nWhat's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?\nI'ma kill you, you lil mothaf-\nUh-uh, temper, temper\nMr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK\nComin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way\nHow in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that\nAw, **** it, what am I sayin'?\nDo 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40ebb43e7d534ce34282bdc8027ea273.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
