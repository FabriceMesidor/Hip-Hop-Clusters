After he passed the beat\nSince you said I was your Magesty, I had to see\nAnd when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy\nThat I can get her so gone, the ho be trippin talkin up her love a lot\nBut the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock\nOr when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots\nFuck the ho thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes\nThe speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict\nBe pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls\nPlayer haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust\nSso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin\nMotherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up\nYou insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan\nWhat up the filet minion, the grey poupon\nThem hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb\nNow I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone\nAnd let me pull my pouch of snuff\nIn between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe\nAnd let your tongue go coastin low, now\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d3d24875934a3f4e43760767e5f7584d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
