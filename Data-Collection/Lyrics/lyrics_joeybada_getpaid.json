Paul\nThat was sorrow to the children of tomorrow\nAnother pill swallowed and a bottle of Moscato\nShots follow like a train, this shit never end\nSame city, different boroughs, so we can't be friends\nI can't pretend this shit don't bother me\nMoney for lottery but can't solve poverty\nThe streets is starving me, of all my good wills and my sovereignty\nI hope my people don't dishonor me, but I'm just tryna get paid\n\n[Hook]\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nJust tryna get rich in the next seven days, but\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nJust tryna get ends for the rest of our days\n\n[Bridge]\nWe just tryna stay paid\nMy niggas tryna stay paid\nWonder if heaven got a ghetto\nBut I ain't tryna be no slave\nCause we just tryna stay paid\nMy niggas tryna stay paid\nWondering if heaven got a ghetto\nCause I ain't really tryna be a slave\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you could be the prophet or you could be the scholar but what's power?\nIs knowing that your knowledge make you richer than the dollar\nWho couldn't afford college, but nigga paid attention\nDropped out and now he getting paid for attending\nBut that ain't my message, just the road that I stepped in\nMy curse and my blessings, watch as life teach lessons\nPeople wanna bet that I walked it off, folks, uh\nHere's a silver spoon full of salt, it's your call\nJust please don't leave me spoilt for too long, you know time\nThat old man's blind, couldn't see him, doing the crime\nOh, sweet, mother of mine, ya child will come to grow\nWeathers on that wise dome so I always come to know\nJust don't get too comfortable, seek knowledge and get the dough\nCash will come when you see your people open up your soul to them\nCause they the only one that know the way you feel\nI move sweet 'til I'm in my holy feel\nAnd if you knew me, then you probably know me still\nAnd I ain't make it yet but know I strictly will\nThis ain't no time to chill, it's time to collect\nTime to step it, you respect, yo, with that mic check, uh\n\n[Hook]\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nJust tryna get rich in the next seven days, but\nMe and my niggas really tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nMe and my niggas we just tryna stay paid\nJust tryna get ends for the rest of our days\n\n[Bridge]\nWe just tryna stay paid\nMy niggas tryna stay paid\nWonder if heaven got a ghetto\nBut I ain't tryna be no slave\nCause we just tryna stay paid\nMy niggas tryna stay paid\nWondering if heaven got a ghetto\nCause I ain't really tryna be a slave", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e93c11b7f798d3eb340c8204f443db0f.498x497x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
