Uh\nIf Daddy never tried cocaine\nCocaine, uh (Say what?)\n\n[Interlude: Royce Da 5'9\" & Nikki Grier]\nIn my throat\nSo my father's only next logical step was to go to rehab\nCan't let go\nAnd that's exactly what he did\nOf my high hopes\nHe went to rehab and got completely clean\nHasn't done a drug\nMy high hopes\nIn over 20 years\nHe did that for himself but\nMy high hopes\nHe did that because he didn't want to lose us\nWhew, strong man\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nUh, now let's talk about how much I respect my pop\nHe's been through so much in life, we ain't never had a lot\nWe just had each other's back, that was really all we need\nPop', I love you unconditional and thanks for loving me\nMore than cocaine\nMy father chose me over cocaine\nCocaine, uh\nI'm proud to say that I'm an addict who inherits your pain\n\n[Outro: Nikki Grier]\nTrust is broke\nWords got choked\nIn my throat", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ece0d83dced13a6ca8fbcbc25cfd032f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
