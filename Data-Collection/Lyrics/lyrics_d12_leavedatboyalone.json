'em\nAnd they don't want him to come back strong\nI wouldn't dare get that boy going\nI said leave dat boy alone\nCause yall don't know him\nThat there boy he out cold\nAnd that there boy he been known\nTo tear some shit up when he in that zone\n\n[Bridge 2X: Eminem]\nBetter leave that boy alone\nBetter leave that boy alone\nBetter leave that boy alone\nCause you don't want to get that boy going\n\n[Verse 1: Swift]\nIt's my attitude that's making me bust shit\nI ain't to be fucked with\nSo basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift\nI run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks\nBe turning ghost 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped\nI'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass\nWith a mag and, I'll be glad to send another one after you\nWithout no hesitation, I'll run up in your house and wake your spouse up\nAnd give her gun to mouth resuscitation\nA niggas information, they haunted and they sad\nGot you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag\nWe coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you\nWe master ready, slash like relatives of Manson\nWhen you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing\nComing here is the worst mistake that could ever happen\nWhen I'm in my vehicle, I'm pulling you in\nI guarantee the world will never see you again\nMotherfucker\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYall better leave dat boy alone\nCause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em\nAnd they don't want him to come back strong\nI wouldn't dare get that boy going\nI said leave dat boy alone\nCause yall don't know him\nThat there boy he out cold\nAnd that there boy he been known\nTo tear some shit up when he in that zone\n\n[Verse 2: Kon Artis]\nHonest to god I usually try to keep to my self\nBut it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well\nLet me explain something to ya\nA real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets\nHe's trying to get out, feel me?\nAnd he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk\nAnd wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb ho punk\nAt least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause\nThat nigga's dying over pride to prove he got balls\nI play keyboards, I don't play beef\nYou borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit\nYou think it's fun that you home sick and you can't really get sleep\nCause you done laid a nigga down, but that ain't me\nWell my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vain\nI'm a man, I do my business and I do it again\nIf you take it to that level, I take it to whoever\nWant to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYall better leave dat boy alone\nCause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em\nAnd they don't want him to come back strong\nI wouldn't dare get that boy going\nI said leave dat boy alone\nCause yall don't know him\nThat there boy he out cold\nAnd that there boy he been known\nTo tear some shit up when he in that zone\n\n[Verse 3: Kuniva]\nNow people know I live trifling, I express it through writing\nIf you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting\nAnd I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife\nAnd I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning\nClash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men\nBeen harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner\nPlus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling\nCause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones\nAnd I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one\nI know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones\nGo buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns\nYou looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none\nYou niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts\nYou soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut\nNo time for the why whats, I'm writing these five words\n\"Fuck you dick riding niggas,\" count it, it's five words\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nYall better leave dat boy alone\nCause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em\nAnd they don't want him to come back strong\nI wouldn't dare get that boy going\nI said leave dat boy alone\nCause yall don't know him\nThat there boy he out cold\nAnd that there boy he been known\nTo tear some shit up when he in that zone\n\n[Bridge 2X: Eminem]\nBetter leave that boy alone\nBetter leave that boy alone\nBetter leave that boy alone\nCause you don't want to get that boy going\n\n[Outro]\nSwifty McVay (that boy he hot to death)\nMr. Porter (that boy he hot to death)\nTHE Kuniva (that boy he hot to death)\nYep, better step before you get beat to death\nYall dont want to get dem there boys\nDem there boys be makin noise\nDem there boys got all kind of toys\nYou better step before you get destroyed\nD12\nDem there boys they hot to death them boys", "image":
