'Cause black is beautiful\nSnappin' so hard, I might snap a cuticle\nFifty million in the bank, know my circle like a tank\nThink you can get in, you can't\nKiss a bitch hand and she faint\nKiss a bitch hand and she faint\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\nWho got the juice like me?\nWho got the juice like, who got the juice like (Bobby)\nI'm finna give her the D\nEnd of the night, she gon' be screamin', be screamin' (Bobby)\nWho sell out arenas?
