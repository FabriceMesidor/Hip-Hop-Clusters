Then I got plenty of flowers to blow\nSmoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong\nDon't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song\nAnd do it however you please, you please\nToday's the day to smoke weed\n\n[Hook]\nSo go ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)\nSo go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nDamn, a pound ain't really nothing now\nRemember smoking with my cousin\nNow we all Raw cone stuffing\nEnough to wake neighbors up\nKK my favorite flavor\nAnd you ain't gotta ask cause we major\nI smoke like them old players\nOnly put it in the paper\nI just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me\nKnown to keep the room cloudy\nGet a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open\nThe best trees I be smoking\nSmell it through the bag so it's potent\nEven get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice\nRan in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it\nA pothead but I be focused\nAnd it ain't in my session if it's bullshit\nOnly the best what you dealing with\nIt's legal now, everybody's doing this\n\n[Hook]\nSo go ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)\nSo go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\nGo ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up\nSo go ahead and put your J's up\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana na\n\n[Outro]\nCome and smoke with me tonight, tonight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/60bf707949edab977c5ad8da61ef82a2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
