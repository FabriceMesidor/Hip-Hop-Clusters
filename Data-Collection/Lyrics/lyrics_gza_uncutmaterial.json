(Why not?)\nI'm speaking about stacks, GZA (That's all I got)\nThe raw un-cut material (That's all I drop)\n\n[GZA]\nThe nucleus of hip hop, rap's hallmark\nThey had a citywide effort to keep us in the dark\nTo the new details, distant wisp of light\nEvidence of a terrifying threats on microphone\nRhyme stone, numerous parts combine\nStrands of heavy metal form the steel arch design\nFit together seamlessly, everlasting rap\nHeat-pressure generated by a blasted cap\nThe chamber when ya rollin' the dice everything count\nClan royalty where the loyalty is paramount\nCouldn't be more wrong prior to your pursuing\nWhen ya spoke of us, you understated the influence\nAs I bury my motor-action, implode a fraction\nOf ya investigation when ya askin\nAware about in ya suit and tie, cruising by\nThe intrepid workmen that sharpen ya shooting eye\n\n[Hook 2x]\n\n[GZA]\nLike a child I have infinite patience when I write\nThe victim's dental records showed they loved to bite\nThe under like removed off a charged battery\nSomeone had his ear stuffed wit the sweets of flattery\nA live wire, fired the shot in the booth\nIt wasn't even in the shooting distance of truth\nWho broke the barrier causing mass hysteria?\nAt the darkest hour in the most densed area\nIn a stocking cap, undercover, while disguising\nI'm rapidly advancing our horizons\nThis path of trade with the sharp blade, open to all across the globe\nThey simply heard my call\nWe hit up, the remote and primitive land\nLeft walking reminders that saw it first-hand\nThe music was a secure link we all think\nOn the same page as holding the ink, now whatchu think?\n\n[Hook 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6eec7781b61d16cab75a144ab36ff78d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
