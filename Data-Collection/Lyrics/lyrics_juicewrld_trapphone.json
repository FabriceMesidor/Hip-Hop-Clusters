An L beat?\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nHit the trap phone, I got what he want\nHe do what he can, I do what he don't\nRun up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no\nChoppa got a kick bitch, no dojo\nBitch who is this? Got a new phone\nMoney old as hell, no group home\nFuck one M bitch I got a few of those\nShe know I'm a dog, young Cujo\n\n[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]\nOh my god what is this? An L beat?\nYou know how I'm boming, rifle like a Russian\nGun to your head bitch, concussion\nYou ain't talkin' bread bitch, no discussion\nMy gun like a volcano its eruptin'\nCausing a ruckus, pissing in public\nYoung rich nigga don't give a fuck if I want it\nHe get all the smoke in the world if he want it\nI could fuck every hoe in the world if I wanted\nSpaz on they ass, rockstar drag no race\nGun with a mask, I ain't ever catchin' no case\nNo way, 3K for the coke bitch\nAndre, backwoods for the dope bitch\nAlways\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nHit the trap phone, I got what he want\nHe do what he can, I do what he don't\nRun up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no\nChoppa got a kick bitch, no dojo\nBitch who is this? Got a new phone\nMoney old as hell, no group home\nFuck one M bitch I got a few of those\nShe know I'm a dog, young Cujo\n\n[Verse 2: G Herbo]\nOh my God what is this? An L beat?\nShe know I'm a dog, call me blue nose\nCall me red nose, no not Rudolph\nPulled up in a Lambo, took my roof off\nYou ain't even gon' put your mans on, nigga how you a boss\nAnd I don't even choose to floss, [?] use the sauce\nAnd it don't matter what we did to win cause the losers lost\nImma probably pull up in that SRT again but Imma get the hawk\nNiggas broke as fuck can't speak on what I'm doing today you don't get to talk\nAnd I walk that talk, why you niggas talk\nBalenciaga and G Fazo ooh thats how I walk\nIf you talkin' bout [?] my M's you can play with a few of those\nI ain't gon' catch you out like him, Imma pay for this Uber tho\n\n[Chorus: Juice WRLD]\nHit the trap phone, I got what he want\nHe do what he can, I do what he don't\nRun up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no\nChoppa got a kick bitch, no dojo\nBitch who is this? Got a new phone\nMoney old as hell, no group home\nFuck one M bitch I got a few of those\nShe know I'm a dog, young Cujo\n\n[Outro: Juice WRLD]\nBitch who is this?
