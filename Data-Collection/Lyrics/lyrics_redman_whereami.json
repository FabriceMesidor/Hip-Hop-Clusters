Rap, fuck where you be at\nMake moves where you sleep at, the realness what MC's lack\nSo I kick subliminals for all hardcore criminals\nGiving you, something funky to listen to\nDramatic, wiping your crew off with automatics\nGhetto tactics, backwards, I can knock the world off it's axis\nAnd the buddah keeps my luger hot as Freddie Kruger\nWho's the, next loser, to show their true colors\nBrothers and sisters, I'm like a Motion Picture\nRedman's the name, occupation? Smoking niggas\nI does it, I do it\nI represent Newark to the fullest I could prove it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Redman]\nYou know my style, steelo\nThrow more bombs then Dan Marino\nI jams like Groover Washington live at the BeJu\nFlatline people I'm live, lyrics are evil\nI got connections up on Pluto *schhh* I read you\nThe cock thriller, vagina killer\nMy nine miller, and my niggas\nControl dirty raps like Willer\nRecognize, im from The Bricks, Dee pack two clips\nLex got two tecs in the Lex, in case shit flips\nSo who's the next contestant to flex\nI translate like Fugees, whether live or Memorex\nDef Squad crew always got some fly shit on deck\nCause it ain't where you from, it's about where you at\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25359d63f56b72aab90b2cd65637974c.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
