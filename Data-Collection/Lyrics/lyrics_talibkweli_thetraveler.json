Period]\n\n[Hook]\nTake your mind on a trip with the traveler\nMore spit than you fit days on the calendar\nIt's amazing how I blaze all the challengers\nRaise up the bar, raise up the caliber\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe get it high, we 'bout to keep some low\nYou looking at a Brooklyn cat that's finna blow\nI'm considered so dangerous\nThe cops about to hop out with they Glocks out while you banging this\nYou get arrested for molesting my ears\nThere's no respect for that in jail, you get molested for years\nWhere the record in your skin permanent like tatted tears\nYou got tats where I spit at your face, face your fears\nI'm the light facing the deer when he run out on the highway\nYou stuck like you in the parked gear in the driveway\nFuck why these dudes up in here looking sideways\nKilled the game without rhyming or saying I'd do it my way\nI fuck with the mixtapes, record deals, real estate\nTour dates, more and more flights for the family\nFeel the hate, still feeling great, making fantasies\nCome true; when I come through, it's insanity\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nRappers is filled with hate like the spit of a bigot\nThey thinking smaller than a midget on Jiminy Cricket\nAnd then I hit them with some shit that's cleverly wicked\nIt's an unfortunate event, like Lemony Snicket\nWhat up, sonny? Go easy like the bees made honey\nWhy give you the cure when the disease make money?\nThe fire that forever burn\nWhen they say your fire that burn out\nThey say you're turning in every dollar ever earned\nSome niggas never learn; some niggas get it, though\nI get in the beat like Lee Gonit parking Indigo\nMy record finna go like twenty-four inch rims\nOr two chicks on E -- they spinning, nigga, they spinning!\nWe winning, nigga, we winning; this is straight up and down\nThis ain't bullshit they made up, like the face of a clown\nGot they knees buckling from the weight of the sound\nBut they fiending, so they leaning when they playing it loud\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/talib-pic.png"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
