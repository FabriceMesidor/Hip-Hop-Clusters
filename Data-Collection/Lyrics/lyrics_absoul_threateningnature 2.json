This shit ridiculous\nThe chicken came before the egg is my hypothesis, and\nThis ain't a album, this an algorithm, yeah\nWe went from pickin' cotton for men in wigs and stockings\nTo liberation and renaissances\u2014what is this nonsense?!\nAnd we don't speak on sexism much as we really should\nThe black man could vote before the woman could\nYou singin' hymns in church, I'm lookin' for the her's\nIn 66 books in the Bible, they ain't let a lady say one word\nHilary Clinton is out somewhere\nTryin' to get ahead in the Senate\nI'm getting head and I'm sinnin', nigga, I'm threatenin' nature", "image": "https://images.genius.com/216d5ad8aa97fe78835ee2f384785ee8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
