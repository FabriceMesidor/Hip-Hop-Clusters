back, reminiscin' on my teens\nA young G, gettin' paid over dope fiends\nFuckin' off cash that I made\nNigga, what's the sense of workin' hard, if you never get to play\nI'm hustlin', stayin' out till it's dawn\nAnd comin' home at 6 o'Clock in the mornin'\nHand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize\nFinger on the trigger when a nigga ride\nAnd I be Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door\nPick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four\nStuck on full, drunk again\nSpill a little liquor for my homies in the Pen'\nSay them thug life niggas be like major pimps\nStickin' to the rules was a major sin\nKeep my finger on my Mac man\nThe crack game ain't shit\nNiggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n(and I) I ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I'll be stayin' strapped\nMy Mac-11 make my nuts bigger\nI keep my finger on the trigger for you jealous niggas\nWonder why a motherfuckers nutty, and why I'm up worried\nWhen I see a cemetery full of dead buddies\nMama told me \"son, don't lie\"\nAnd Mama's in the back smokin' crack and a nigga wanna die\nCan't cry cause I'm loc'd up\nChoked up, nigga puffing on that indo getting fucked up\nAnd in the back of my mind, I know I'm wrong\nAlcohol make a young motherfucker think he ballin'\nCollect calls to my old bitches, send more pictures\nOn the phone, tryin' to bone cause I miss ya\nBack on the streets I'm losin' focus\nI'm hopeless, homies dyin' over small time dope shit\nKeep my finger on my Mac man\nThe crack game ain't shit\nNiggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you wanna make a million?\nAnd motherfuckers catchin' drug cases\nI place my Glock outside my waist and keep a thug face\nEven on a good day!, gotta stay strapped\nLivin' in my hood, hey!\nNiggas will spray caps\nAnd everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray\nSo I stay clutchin' on my AK\nMurderin' niggas that oppose me\nThat's how it goes, you motherfuckers try to play me and the homies\nTime to make my get-away\nI hid away in the backstreets\nCouldn't let the police jack me\nGotta be quiet, I'm on the down low\nI got that ya-yo movin' by the pound so\nWhen the police try me out, fuck the judge\nGot a homie that'll bond me out, straight love\nKeep my finger on my Mac man\nThe crack game ain't shit\nNiggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n\n[Verse 4]\nStuck on fool, Tanqueray got a nigga high\nLord knows I don't need another DUI\nI lead a Thug Life, heartless hustler\nJust cause I fucked, don't mean I trust her\nNow my pagers vibratin', can't sleep\nSo I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley\n\"Is it cool to fuck?\" That's what I'm askin'\nBitch recognized game and started laughin'\nNow I'm all in the guts and shit\nPrayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick\nCause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know\nI'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho\nLots of hoes gettin' mad as shit\nI let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch\nKeep my finger on my Mac man\nThe crack game ain't shit\nNiggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\n(cause) I ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't cry, bury me a G\nI ain't got time for bitches\nGotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches\nEven when I die, they won't worry me\nMama don't
