I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck\nTo leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct\nI've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!\nWe gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!\n\n[Verse 4: Kuniva]\nI walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip\nI'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth\nYour carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick\nWe can't take you serious, you a comedy skit\nYou probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's\nBut the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe\nYou speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it\nThe only thing that you selling is woof tickets\nI look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack\nSo when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach, and when they want it I'll bring\nA hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nCome on then, everybody come on and\nKick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in\n'Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and\nWake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning\n'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning\nSo have a sing along with the words of the song and\nIf you don't know the words and you can't sing along then\nFake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in\nEverybody good morning", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6246e5d82871d591568c0f8881ed9690.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
