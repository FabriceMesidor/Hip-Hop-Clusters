It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, \"fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\"\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath\n'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who like you just 'cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, \"Fuck, is he speaking to me?\"\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (uhh)\nTyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play Xbox and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating 'bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\n'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (what the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a \"hey\" (sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boy-crush got started\"\n\n[Outro]\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde81a162bfe7b81092c8630cdf16d70.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
