Hold your head wherever you at\nOn the flow from the cops with wings on your back\nThat snitch cat - gave police your location\nWe'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation\nYo listen, shit ain't the same without you at home\nHoliday niggas walk around tryin to be your clone\nThey really fear you, when you was at home they was pale\nThat's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail\nBy the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up\nTried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up\nGot caught up in a crime that you can't take back\nReminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac\nYears ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep\nWonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep\nAt night, you know my mouth is tight\nI never sang to the cops cause that just ain't right\nSometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack\nDamn - how did kids let it go down like that?\nIt'll be a long time before the temperature drops\nOut in New York, me and your older blood got it locked\nKeep your brain sane, as I turn the next page\nYoung niggas packing macs, acting triple they age\nAnd they blasting: probably won't reach the age of twenty\nTelling niggas slow down, they start looking at you funny\nHard to tell who's the enemy\nThe next man or the man next to me\nP, no man is a friend of me\nAs far as I see, when you get home, somewhere in the year two-G Now the whole entire world look differently\nYou see, a nigga struck with reality, painfully\nWord up\n\n[Hook: Crystal Johnson]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
