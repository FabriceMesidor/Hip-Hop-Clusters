Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will\n\nMy point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved\n\nThey cut out our tongues so we couldn't communicate to each other.  I will not allow my tongue to be cut\n\nKanye vs the media is modern day Willie Linch theory.\n\nthey hung the most powerful in order to force fear into the others.\n\nthey can no longer stop our voice.\n\nthe Nat Turner movie never made it anywhere because it showed slaves revolting. I understand why my god brother Puff calls his network revolt.\n\nif this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Nat\n\nthe universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome.\n\nwe are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation.\n\nthe reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought        It was just an idea\n\nonce again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas\n\nin school we need to learn how magic Johnson built his business not always about the past. Matter fact I've never even heard of a high school class that presents future ideas\n\nwhen the media masses and scholars talk about what started today. Here's a title ...\n\nthe overground hell road\n\nI freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves. - Harriet Tubman\n\n[Cristiano Tweet]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
