Don't it ever get boring to you?\nI realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power, fuck it more to you\nSaw through you and it made me ashamed that I played the game\nNot for mo' money like Damon Wayans\nWanted the respect but it came with fame\nI just wanted love but this ain't the same\nI took a train down memory lane\nAnd watched little Jermaine do his thing before he made a name\nIt's like Sony signed Basquiat\nHe gave it all he got, and now a nigga don't paint the same, damn\nI guess he can't complain\nAll the money that be raining in\nSpend a hundred thou for the chain again\nThink of old school niggas like Dana Dane\nProbably kill for another claim to fame, my brain the same\nYeah, nigga, at least he ain't insane\nAt least he ain't insane\nYou ain't crazy, motherfucker, you just afraid of change\nThat's new, maybe that's true\nBut listen here I got a bigger fear\nOf one day that I become you\nWhen I become lost and I become heartless\nAnd numb from all the M\u00e9nages\nJust one bitch don't feel the same no more\nAnd Henny don't really kill the pain no more\nNow I'm Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain\nCause I can't maintain no more\nTad bit extreme I know\nMoney can't save your soul\nBut there go you\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nAnd there go you, and there go you, and there go you\nSelling me dreams and telling me things you knew\nAnd there go you, and there go you, and there go you\nSelling me dreams and telling me things you knew\n\n[Hook]\nSing, you got what I want, I got what you need\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"\nYou got what I want, I got what you need\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"\n\n[Outro]\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"\n\"How much for your soul, Anna?\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fbfa7c8b3518f456c489c0bc1cf3ffd5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
