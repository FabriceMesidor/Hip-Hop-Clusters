my shirt\nWish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed\nTrippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors\nThe age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies\nUncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me\nMy mother gave birth but she really never had me\nLeft to the hood to play daddy\nRaised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae\nWith weight so they weigh they status on the streets\nLicense plates that say they, motto\nThis is Chicago in the heyday\nSimilar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ\nA skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures\nSo many niggas, stacked upon each other\nIt's the black upon each other that we love so much\nWonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch\nUsed to gangbang, ain't really thug that much\nRather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch\nWent to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years\nMy college career got downed with a couple of beers\nCame back home, now I gotta pay back loans\nSame nigga, same block, same shit they on\nOnly thing different, quicker, they click that chrome\nIn my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone\nMan to man, I'm good workin' with my hands\nMy generation never understood workin' for the man\nAnd, of being broke I ain't a fan\nNow I stand in the same spot as my old man\nMy life I planned not to be on this corner\nI still wanna see California\nBut this is my world\n\n[Hook]\nIt's your world\n\n[Verse 2]\nLife and death flow around us\nFour pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners\nIt's hard to stay grounded\nWe stay high, that's why old folks down us\nLost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us\nAin't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us\nWe paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures\nRemoved from Earth, only to return through birth\nKnew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth\nBetween God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass\nWith a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed\nShe know dairy so she say cheese to get bread\nIn the area where it's more weaves and less dreads\nKinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads\nSaid it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt\nShe was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt\nVery well in a world where self hate is overt\nHer stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike\nShe got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures\nDoin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her\nIn the ass, it used to be thicker\nLife is fast, some choose to be quicker\nI remember in high school she had a passion to sing\nNow she see herself in a casket in dreams\nThese are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack\nSelf-esteem, yo we forgot the dream\nOn our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme\nIn the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team\nThis queen never seen herself on this Corner\nShe still wanna see California\nBut this is her world\n\n[Hook]\nIt's your world\n\nKids\nI wanna be a pediatrician\nI wanna be a governor\nI want to be a artist\nI wanna be a veterinarian\nI wanna be a model\nI wanna be a doctor\nI wanna be a ballet dancer\nI wanna be a football player\nI wanna be a astronaut\nI wanna be a obstetrician\nI wanna be a doctor\nI wanna be a nurse\nI wanna be a fashion designer\nI want to be a gym teacher\nI wanna be a architect\nI want to be a duck\nI wanna be a wrestler\nI wanna be a dancer\nI wanna be the first African-American female president\nI wanna be a police officer\nI wanna be a rock star\nI wanna be a gymnastics teacher\nI wanna be a captain of a police station\nI wanna be a drummer\nI wanna be an actress\nI wanna be a superstar\n\n[POPS]\nBe, be here, be there, be that, be this\nBe grateful for life, be grateful to life\nBe gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000\nBe-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie\nBe little black Sambo with bad hair\nBe aware of Willie Lynch-ism\nBe, be boundless energy\nBe a four star ghetto general, be no one except I\nBe a strong academic student, be an A student in Sociology\nBe food for thought to the growin mind, be the author of your own horoscope\nBe invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful\nBe a proud run, only to return to fight another day\nBe peaceful if possible, but justice at any rate\nBe high when you low, be on time but know when to go\nBe cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East\nBe absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves\nBe visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin\nA nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartographer\nA map maker, be able to find Afro-American land\nSearch thoroughly, it may be close to black land\nBe amended 5/5ths, be amended 5/5ths human\nBe the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life\nBe cupid, to world government\nBe found among the truth, lost tribe\nBe at full strength when walking through the valley\nBe not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top\nBe a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth\nBe loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King\nBe that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house\nBe... eternal", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af231bd3cefe10a3d898842a54af3d3f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
