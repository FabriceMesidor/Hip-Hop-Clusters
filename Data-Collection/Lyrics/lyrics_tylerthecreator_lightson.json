Now am I getting closer?\nTaking the streets, I'm moving slow\nSure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?\nI just wanna get there before you go\nI hope I'm getting closer\nI hope I'm getting closer\n\n[Chorus: Santigold]\nLeave the lights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\nLights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\nUnlock the door\nI'm coming, I'm coming\nNo matter how far\nLeave the lights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\n[Verse 2: Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator]\nI'll be there in the morning\nI'll be there before you know it\nGoing fast as I can\nBut the traffic is bad\nAnd my rental is slow\nI'm coming, I'm coming\nI'm coming home\nYou on my team, I can't be alone\nYou hear that ring, I pick up the phone\nCall, a plane, a walk, a train\nNo matter which way baby, I'm coming home\nWish that I could press fast forward\nTo the part where I get there\nSeeing all the lights on\n\n[Chorus: Santigold]\nLeave the lights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\nLights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\nUnlock the door\nI'm coming, I'm coming\nNo matter how far\nLeave the lights on\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\n[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]\nBar is low, texts slow\nNo goodbyes, no xo\nMy flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)\nHurry cause the plan's urgent\nI'm trying to get home like the man's version\nEmergency until I see you\nAnd then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon\nBut let me take your bow off\nWooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off\nYou my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door\nIt's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on\n\n[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]\nYeah, leave the lights on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/675433e2d1ee3509aaea0d083f4f8d32.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
