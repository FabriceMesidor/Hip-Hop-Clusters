I'm stuck with the broken smile\nNo joking now, wanting to grab a swish and smoke this out\nThe moment of a man choosing what path I will go down\nDo I give in, give up, or get up and live right now?\nWith a split gut pick myself up and spit my style\nThis is the only thing that can hold my ground\nYou're born into this world alone, and alone you'll go out\nAll I have is myself and everyone else I doubt\nYou can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound\nInside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now\nNo sunshine when she's gone, I can only see clouds\nNo homies can hold me down, the spirit's testing me now\nBut I can withstand this world, but it seems so foul\nFlood of emotions, it's like I'm being held down to drown\nHell's right around the corner, but I can turn it around\nYou always have a choice, no matter the situation you're not bound\nTo nothing, no one, you're chosen for this job\nThis is your life, you can't escape this bitch when it's hard\nJust know that it passes, but you'll collect scars\nThey never go away, but they will make you who you are\nThis is a beautiful struggle, I share it in song cause\nI can't control this, remember: the moment's beyond us\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd all my people say whoa, whoa, yeah\nAnd all my people say whoa, whoa\nAnd all my people say whoa, whoa, yeah\nAnd all my people say whoa, whoa\nC'mon\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
