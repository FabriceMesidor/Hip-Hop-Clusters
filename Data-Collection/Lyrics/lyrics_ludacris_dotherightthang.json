Come to yo' sense manye\nSnow is all around you, but you don't play in the winter games!\nCartridges surround you, but you ain't playin Nintendo games!\nLoad 'em up and fill 'em up, to the top before you cock and aim\nTryna get from the bottom to the top like the stock exchange\nShower, shit and shave and hit the corner for a block exchange\nAmazing what my people'll do for some pocket change\nBut maybe this ain't the life that you chose (chose)\nThis is the life where you stay strapped and pack a knife or end up with a blooded nose\nStreet survivor or survivor of the streets! (streets!)\nAnd only the strong survive, there's no survival for the weak! (weak!)\nCatch a sneak peak of death if you ain't on ya Ps and Qs\nThey carry banana clips and niggas'll peel you for ya shoes\nIt's the blues, but not on Hill Street - you could call it \"kill or be killed\" street\n\"Lost a pint of blood, let it SPILL\" street\nSTOP AND WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}\nWAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}\n\n[Hook One: Ludacris]\nThey say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame\nAnd it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin\nUse your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)\nUse your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)\nYou say the only family that you got is in a gang\nAnd the only way to make it is by sellin cocaine, but I'm sayin\nUse your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)\nUse your brain homie, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)\n\n[Common]\nI've been in his ear since we were drinkin beers\nYears we've spent together, used to break up get-togethers\nWith a fight every night gettin' cheddar, movin white\nOur thang, so we had to \"Do it Right\" like Spike\nHoldin 40s, gettin green on acres, these broads were our mules\nThat's when we used to serve in front of Com'wealth School\nFuel for cars and jewels, chains and tools\nIt was organized crime but we remained confused\nMom in the pews, singin, \"Lord, protect 'em\"\nYou might not a-gree with our views, but you had to respect 'em\nDiamonds in the rough, but were we reflectin\nA system that's aburpt, the streets under pressure\nOne morning in the mirror, I seen my reflection\nA young man with good spirits but needed direction\nI guess my man's death was my resurrection\nCause now I hear him sayin from heaven, \"Wake up!\nWake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!\nWake UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!\"\n\n[Hook Two: Ludacris] + (Common)\nThey say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame\nAnd it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin\n(Use your brain homie, do the right thang!) Lemme talk to 'em\n(Use your brain homie, do the right thang!) Lemme talk to 'em\nYou say the only family that you got is in a gang\nAnd the only way to make it is by sellin cocaine, but I'm sayin\n(Use your brain homie, do the right thang!) Lemme talk to 'em\n(Use your brain homie, do the right thang!) Lemme talk to 'em\n\n[Ludacris]\nI woke up this morning and got a call\nMy partner said he had news about a girl named Baby Doll\nShe got four baby daddies; four kids by four different men\nAnd she just found out she's pregnant, I said, \"No, not again!\"\nMan, when she gonna learn she don't wanna spend her life in court?\nLookin for back payments and fightin for that child supports\nChasin checks, chasin her ounce of respect, chasin paper\nChasin entertainers or rappers and ballplayers\nNot carin about a condom, I say, \"Help her Lord, PLEASE\"\n'fore she stuck wit mo' babies or ends up fightin some di-SEASE\nYou know that you a momma, and, mommas, we can't lose ya (no!)\nTreat yourself better; you carry seeds to the future (whoo!)\nAnd the future looks dim if we don't get ourselves together\nWe gotta sacrifice, some do WHATEVER for the cheddar\nSo make the right decisions 'til you ready to give birth\nAnd know that you the most precious gift we have on this earth\nBabies, stop and WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!! {*rooster crows*}\nWAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!! {*rooster crows*}\n\n[Hook Three: Ludacris]\nThey say my folks'll do WHATEVER for the fortune and the fame\nAnd it'll take a FORTUNE to get rid of all the pain, but I'm sayin\nUse your brain baby, do the right thang!
