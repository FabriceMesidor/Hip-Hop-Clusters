Teach peace to the babies\nWe're all the same\nAt least for the ho's sake\nStepped on an undisclosed rake\nCatch a nose-ache...\nY'all flows is fake\nYodle-eh-hee-who wants to be my protege?\nMe\u2014me too!\nSo parrot-back it\nI'm an underlined caret bracket\nGreater than or equal to\nBut greater than four stars\nGreater than straight-A report cards\nGreater than poor sports in divorce courts or sports bars\nWhat's your mission?\nMaking hundreds\nShaking blunders in this self (inaudible) taking on fun-filled until\u2014\nDone\u2014chill\nIt ain't all about the dollar bill\nYou could be dead broke and be a scholar still\nThat's true\nWhat question should I ask you?\nUh\u2014\"What type of ill-type of tricks do the mask do?\"\nOkay; what type of ill-type of ill tricks do the mask do?\nThe face plate remove and I give chicks tattoos\nBut then they can see your face!\nI make 'em look the other way\nI almost caught a case off that same shit the other day\nIn Grady's truck is where I first got lucky\nIn the 80s, now I make the ladies say, \"Yucky!\" like Sandy\nBollocks, that old mustache is bull-snot\nOn your bald spot\nNow that's what I call hot!\n\n[Produced by Prince Paul]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c400a30e035298cbbd8473db03168ec7.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
