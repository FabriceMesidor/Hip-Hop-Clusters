(Need a little...)\nNeed a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven...(Need a little...)\nTime we get some Geto Heaven\nGeto...\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove, your happiness don't begin wit a man\nStrong woman, why should you depend on a man?\nI understand you want a man that's resourceful\nIf he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you\nTalking to a friend, about what love is\nHer man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his\nHugged her from afar, said what I felt\nYou never find a man, 'til you find yourself\nTime helps mistakes, you can learn from\nOne man F'd up, men you shouldn't turn from\nYou want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too\nAt that destination, a king will anoint you\nGoing through the storm, many bodies seem warm\nThat relationship died, for you to be born, you're worth more\nThan anything you could cop at a store\nFor you to grow, he had to go, so what you stoppin' him for?\nNot even I could ignore being alone is hard\nFind heaven in yourself and God\nFind heaven in yourself and God, girl\n(Find heaven in yourself and God)\n\n[Hook: Macy Gray]\nGeto Heaven... (Need a little...)\nNeed a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven...Need a little...\nTime we get some Geto Heaven\nGeto...\nLa, la, la, la...\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis music is so much bigger than me\nAs far as happy, it's like a trigger to me\nDealing with crab rappers, groupie broads\nRecord execs, at times it do be hard\nTo choose words, be heard across waters\nDoing something you like to support daughters\nKeeping your guys from collecting court orders\nConveying messages the ancestors brought us\nThought of things to say to become the end thing for the day\nSomehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it\nMusic is a gift that is sacred\nI opened it, used it, hoping you could grow to it\nWhether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it\nCan't imagine going through it, without soul music\nIt's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path\nOn my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep\nAnd show depth, as we make people nod\nFind heaven in this music and God, yeah\n(Find heaven in this music and God, y'all)\nFind heaven in this music and God, check it, it's Geto Heaven, baby\n\n[Hook: Macy Gray]\nGeto Heaven... (Need a little...)\nNeed a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven...Need a little...\nTime we get some Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, need a little Geto Heaven\nGeto Heaven, time we get some Geto Heaven...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f41b9f9baf7aa806eaeffecdfbb994a3.250x250x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
