Doc you know he's down with us\nD-Square, he's down with us\nKeyboard Money Mike, is down with us\nI.C.U., you know he's down with us\nD-Nice and McBoo, they're down with us\nMs. Melodie, she's down with us\nJust-Ice and DMX, they're down with us\nMy manager Moe, he's down with us\nCastle-D boy, he's down with us\nD.J. Red Alert, he's down with us\nRobocop boy, he's down with us\nMakin' funky music is a must\nI'm number one\n\nPeople still takin' rappin' for a joke\nA passing hope or a phase with a rope\nSometimes I choke and try to believe\nWhen I get challenged by a million MCs\nI try to tell them, \"We're all in this together!\"\nMy album was raw because no-one would ever\nThink like I think and do what I do\nI stole the show, and then I leave without a clue\n\nWhat do you think makes up a KRS?\nConcisive teaching, or very clear speaking?\nRidiculous bass, aggravating treble\nRebel, renegade, must stay paid\nNot by financial aid, but a raid of hits\nCausing me to take long trips\nI'm the original teacher of this type of style\nRockin' off-beat with a smile\nOr smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to\nBDP Posse so I love to\nStep in the jam and slam\nI'm not Superman, because anybody can\nOr should be able to rock off turntables\nGrab the mic, plug it in and begin\nBut here's where the problem starts, no heart\nBecause of that a lot of groups fell apart\nRap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School\n'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool\nI say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole\nIsn't even twenty years old\nFifty years down the line, you can start this\n'cause we'll be the Old School artists\nAnd even in that time, I'll say a rhyme\nA brand-new style, ruthless and wild\nRunnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun\n'cause even then, I'm still number one\n\n[Verse 2]\nBlastmaster KRS-One of course\nComes to express with style the lost\nWays of rhyming, old and new, past and present\nKnock, knock, who is it?\nA brand-new style, hup, time to change\nPeople talk about me when they see me on stage\nLive in action, guaranteed raw\nI hang with the rich and I work for the poor\nNow tomorrow you can say you saw\nKRS-One stompin' once more\nI play by ear, I love to steer\nThe Alfa Romeo from here to there\nI grab the beer, but not in the ride\n'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive\nI'm not a beginner, amateur or local\nMy album is sellin' because of my vocals\nYou know what you need to learn?\nOld School artists don't always burn\nYou're just another rapper who's had his turn\nNow it's my turn, and I am concerned\nAbout idiots posing as kings\nWhat are we here to rule?\nI thought we were supposed to sing\nAnd if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach\nMany of you are educated, open your mouth and speak\nKRS-One is something like a total renegade\nExcept I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid\nAirplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'\nPoliticians lyin', I'm tryin'\nNot to escape, but hit the problem head-on\nBy bringin' out the truth in a song\nSo BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions\nMade a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'\nPeople have the nerve to take me for a gangster\nAn ignorant one, something closer to a prankster\nDoin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary\nBut in a scale of crime that's really elementary\nThis beat is now compelling me to explain in silence\nWhy my last jam was so violent\nIt's simple: BDP will teach reality\nNo beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free\nSo now you know, a poet's job is never done\nBut I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one\n\nCool Moe Dee, he's down with us\nEric B. and Rakim, they're down with us\nStetsasonic, they're down with us\nDana Dane, he's down with us\nSleeping Bag Records, they're down with us\nMy lawyer Jay, he's down with us\nJive/RCA is down with us\nMakin' funky music is a must\nI'm number one", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9fa55af2e8bfddf3b40ea0e0347874f.556x556x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
