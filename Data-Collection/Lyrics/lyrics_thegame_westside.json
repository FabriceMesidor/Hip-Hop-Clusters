I put a team together, smash out\nSet you up, send a bitch over with her ass out\nIn California, we got them pictures niggas map out\nIn California, we turn a mansion to a stash house\nI fuck around and leave a dub and they O.D. tonight\nYou in good hands, you know the Bloods gon' treat you right\nAin't tryna be your man, no, I don't trust 'em, I just beat it right\nGotta put her in a Uber just so I could sleep at night\nNever stop bangin', nigga, you know it's still Cedar, right?\nAfter this album, nigga, I gotta raise the feature price\n\n[Chorus]\nWest side, west side (West side, west side)\nWest side, west side (West side, west side)\nWest side, west side (West side, west side)\nWest side, west side (West side, west side)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dfc48b3486e022a503a8b9f826166d23.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
