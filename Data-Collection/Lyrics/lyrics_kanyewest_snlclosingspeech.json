They bully me. They bullied me backstage, they said, Don\u2019t go out there with that hat on.\nThey bullied me backstage. They bullied me! And then they say I\u2019m in a sunken place.\nYou wanna see the sunken place?\nOk, I\u2019m gonna listen to y\u2019all now.\nOr I\u2019m gonna put my superman cape on.\nAnd this means you can\u2019t tell me what to do.\nFollow your heart and stop following your mind. That\u2019s how we\u2019re controlled. That\u2019s how we\u2019re programmed.\nIf you want the world to move forward, try love.\nThank y\u2019all for giving me this platform.\nI know some of y\u2019all don\u2019t agree. But y\u2019all be going at that man\u2019s neck a lot, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually that helpful.\nI think the universe has balance.\n90% of news are liberal.\n90% of TV, L.A., New York, writers, rappers, musicians.\nSo it\u2019s easy to make it seem like it\u2019s so, so, so one-sided. And uh\u2026 I am kinda free.\nI thought this country said I could be me.\n(I love you Kanye)\nI love me too.\nAnd I love ya\u2019ll too \u2013 so bring the band back!\nBring the band back.\nWhen you feel that, you\u2019ll understand that.\nWave your motherfucking hands up!\nI feel good.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/60e784540168afea0012aeeb47f6ffa0.246x138x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
