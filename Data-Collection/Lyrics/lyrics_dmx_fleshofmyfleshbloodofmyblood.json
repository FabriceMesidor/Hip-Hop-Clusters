Last thing he heard was \"Boom\"!\nCan I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?\nBreak you in half, fake niggas make me laugh\nY'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money\nAnd ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry\nIt's about to get ugly when the, lights is out\nOne, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out\nHis knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand\nHe in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nI no longer see the shadows that once kept me strong\nAnd I'm starting to get that same feeling that kept me wrong\nCan't afford to trust niggas cause niggas lust figures\nPlus niggas is scared to bust niggas, rush niggas\nDueling with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time\nFucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine\nTired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit\nFuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?\nSucking my dick looking for something new\nLet your man hold something with your hold something crew\nYou know how niggas do, we don't forget shit\nIf you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick\nNo hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff\nAnd every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff\nA lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough\nSo now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nMotherfuckers, thought that the, X would stop\nBut I got niggas like, \"Yo, who's the next to drop?\"\nFrom his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official\nThink when you die how many's gon' miss you\nLean over in your casket and kiss you\nSend you on your way with a blessing\nAnd pray that another learned a lesson\nSmith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow\n(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little\nBeside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves\nI'll murder, ten of you fools before you're ready to choose\nYou either, win or you lose, and I, love to win\nEven if it means I gotta shed blood again\nKeep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me\nReally thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?\nKnowin it don't take me long to write\nMatter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight\n\n[Chorus: DMX]\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what\nFlesh of my flesh, blood of my blood\nAll my niggas get down like what", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
