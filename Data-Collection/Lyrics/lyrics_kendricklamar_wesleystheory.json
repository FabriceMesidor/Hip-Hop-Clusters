A house or a car?\nForty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?\nAnythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI know your kind (That's why I'm kind)\nDon't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)\nPay me later, wear those gators\nClich\u00e9? Then say, \"Fuck your haters\"\nI can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you\nLittle white lies, but it's no white-collar in you\nBut it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you\nBecause you make me live forever, baby\nCount it all together, baby\nThen hit the register and make me feel better, baby\nYour horoscope is a gemini, two sides\nSo you better cop everything two times\nTwo coupes, two chains, two C-notes\nToo much ain't enough, both we know\nChristmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list\nGet it all, you deserve it, Kendrick\nAnd when you hit the White House, do you\nBut remember, you ain't pass economics in school\nAnd everything you buy, taxes will deny\nI'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five\n\n[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]\nYeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)\nLookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)\nYou got a medal for us\nLeavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria\nLook both ways before you cross my mind\n\n[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]\nWe should never gave\nWe should never gave niggas money\nGo back home, money, go back home\nWe should never gave\nWe should never gave niggas money\nGo back home, money, go back home\n\n[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ffb1a13cfda120ba85ab9e2a83a4e158.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
