We over here like we're eavesdropping\nApparently still mad over what I said last year\nOn that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there\nAnd try to act like I can't hear\nWhat? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear\nJust then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down\nKicks me and socks me, ow\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not scared of your stolen power\nSee right through you any hour\nI won\u2019t ease your strain\n\n[Verse 2: Karacter]\nI'm not scared, I'm just a white kid in a black neighborhood\nSide terror\nWipe off this fear, to not thinking clear\nI need to get my head straight\nI do feel like a Nazi in a Jewish camp\nConcentration\nA foolish act to puzzle you fools with the coolest raps like Rubik's cube that I stole just to solve then give it back\nStupid face your making bitch\nLoose the mask\nOh wait\nI'm sorry that's my bad\nLooks like shit\nMight be obvious and a waste of my time to say you look like the crap from a sewage plant\nBut as you were saying\nBack to your rant\nLex Luther just got circles ran round his puny ass so fast his neck snapped and it dropped his pants\nYou've just been schooled by Clark Kent\nShopping at the market\nIn the parking lot next to your apartment and part from it\nYou tried to look hard as shit but you pooed your pants\nAnd I didn't even get to use superman yet\nAnd he's my strong suit\nFall soon back on, to attack these villains, and kill em just passing em back and forth, feeling em then put an axe in their nads\nThat's what I call a hacky sack bitch\nCut cut and pass\nYou think your lucky\nIt's Chucky the mother fucking assassin\nCastrating stuck in the cabinet sucking a bottle of Aspirin\nPreparing a statement while he sharpens his blade\nCarves it across his face as he coughs\nTesting his voice is it raspy\nNope, just naturally nasty\nGet ready for the ass whooping he's bout to serve up like a double cheese burger from Arby's\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not scared of your stolen power\nSee right through you any hour\nI won\u2019t ease your strain\n\n[Verse 3: Karacter]\nDearest resident\nDon't flip past this channel and skip it\nA paramedic is in your living room slitting scissors through your flannel get up\nSo get up, feel better, and add up what I said on that chalk board of yours boarded up inside your head\nYou're almost dead\nI'm your guardian\nHere we are\nReminiscing this shit as we walk down the hall of wits\nShelve these thoughts\nHighlight reel of selfish tall feminist broads\nEveryone that's screwed you over when they said they'd call\nSeminar, phantom here I am sent to ward these demons off\n\n[Eminem]\nOff misogyny\nSodomy, how many chocolaty jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity\nNo wonder you scoff at me, it\u2019s still obvious I invented prick\n\n[Karacter]\nRest in heaven, I'm evidently milking this game like\nHer breasts are dripping\nGuess I'm busy, but unless you bitches are seven teen and eleven months I don't want to hear the pessimism\nTell the rest I'm on readers digest while I'm on the toilet\nPizza sky rocket\nGossip isn't\nClose to the shit\nI must be fast, lickity split\nThere's no exaggeration, I mean it Brittany\nA fan of Trina\nGet's me like I wanna jam my weener in Christina\n\n[Eminem]\nAnd Serena and Selena\nScarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen\nGive me a damn good reason to not wanna slip an Ambien in a Cappuccino\nAnd try to have a threesome with Janet Reno\n\n[Karacter]\nStuff her with cream like a spicy popper of jalapeno\nAppetizer, my main meal's Destiny\nNow, If I die I'll come back to haunt your back side grizzly\nCapitalize the \"Ass\" in fucking Caspar and Wendy\nAs Detroit looking like a power outage, just a black out city\nCrack house just down the street of McDonalds, where you lost your virginity\nOh dity, I'm out\nExplosive, you're left with the call\nYou might want to\n\n[Eminem]\nHead for the fire exits, I'm coming through like a wrecking-ball\n\n[Karacter]\nTest us, we're scared of nothing at all\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not scared of your stolen power\nSee right through you any hour\nI won\u2019t ease your strain\nYou'll be taking it slow, feeding my flame\nShuffling the cards of your game\nAnd just in time\nIn the right place\nSuddenly I will play my ace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
