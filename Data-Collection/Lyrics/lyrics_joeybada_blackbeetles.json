We ain't equal\nAnother world war sequel and doomsday prequel\nThis ain't the world we thought it was when we was in pre-school\nSometimes it's hard to be cool, sometimes I feel like I'm see-thru\nSometimes I really wish, yo I wish that I could be you\nAway from all the Hollywood acts and record contracts\nI won't say I take it back, because I worked hard for that\nBut this life ain't turn out to be what it seem\nEver since I woke up I been living in a dream\nGot me\n\n[Hook]\nLow on self-esteem, foes been out for me\nSomeone's watching me, this love ain't proper B\nThinking I could be dead\nThey got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me\nSomeone's watching me, this love ain't proper B\nThinking I could be dead\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho would've thought a marchin' Martin could spark a starvin' artist\nSpit art, at heart young Marcus Garvey\nPonders on it, hardly, rap wonders fondly\nSmoking  herb with just Marley and me\nThis one is for my dogs barking up on the tree\nSometimes that wind blows eventually she gon leave\nThat's mother nature for ya, uh\nPatient and sagacious\nI ain't gon pay shit watch she ain't gon say shit\nNow that's respectable cause most women expect the dough\nAccept it though, words of the wise through them rhythm-wrecking professional, exceptional\nHalf man, half extraterrestrial\nThey got me\n\n[Hook]\nLow on self-esteem, foes been out for me\nSomeone's watching me, this love ain't proper B\nThinking I could be dead\nThey got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me\nSomeone's watching me, this love ain't proper B\nThinking I could be dead\nThey got me low on self-esteem, foes been out for me\nSomeone's watching me, this love ain't proper B\nThinking I could be dead", "image": "https://images.genius.com/314e5f2acb3d276d4b374900e64b4c42.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
