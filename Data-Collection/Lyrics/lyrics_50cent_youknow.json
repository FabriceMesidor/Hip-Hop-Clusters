We can paint the town red\nThem bottles ain't shit to me, a nigga got bread\nI'm big money, big business, I love it\nPut the bad bitches with big asses and the budget\nI'm the boss, so you know shit is going how it gotta go\nI don't want talk tonight, I might just buy the hoes\nMy pleasure principle spend no expense\nFirst I'm happy then she happy that she can pay the rent\nIt's nothing to a nigga when he up\nBut when they down I bet you he won't give a bitch a buck\nFlip and catch an attitude like ''Bitch, what the fuck?\"\nYou want from a nigga, huh? You fucking up a nigga, huh?'\nLook, girl, you know you're sitting on a gold mine\nFuck with them other niggas think you so fine\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy flow hotter than the gun after that clip done\nDon't care about the set you claim, motherfuck the gang you bang\nI hang around with hustlers and hoodlums\nThat party get the popping then we beefing and we shooting\nLet's party like it's 1999\nFlat top Gazelle, the swag going back in time\nI got it locked, they can't ignore it\nMan, nigga, know some bullshit I'm all for it\nHeroin Don seven sixty leaning\nChrome clean, spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick\nThem victim niggas thinking ''Damn, why me?''\nI'm thinking why these niggas never try me\nMaybe they feel the vibe, they know a nigga live\nI let it off, inside and outside\nThe club rocking, it's on tonight\nThem bottles popping, we getting right\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e38c9fce2a42f96648eb8787c9618ebe.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
