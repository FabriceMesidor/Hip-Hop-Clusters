Will you carry me?\nThrough rain, hail, sleet and snow\nDon't say no, you'll embarass me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Adrienne Bailon]\nI'll be that...\nBaby...\nYeah, yeah, yeah...\nI'll be that, I'll be that...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea54fa933d61e534fbf14d9509cc7146.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
