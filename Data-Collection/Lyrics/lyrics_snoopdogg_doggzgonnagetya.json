day I don't hit the arcade\nI to school from my moms apartment\nI got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit\nCause where I'm at if you soft you lost\nAnd to stay on course, you got to roll with force\nMy homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz\nIn front of his building witht the rest of his friends\nI give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand\nHe's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man\nI go upstairs, I hug my mother\nI kiss my sister and I punch my brother\nI sit down on the bed to watch some TV\n[Gun Shots] Do my ears decieve me\nNo That's the fourth time this week\nFour young brothers got shot in the street\nThe very next day while I'm off to class\nMy momma go to work cold bustin' her ass\nMy sisters cute but shes got no gear\nI got three pair of pants and with my brother I share\nSo there in school I made a fool\nWith one and a half pair of pants, you ain't cool\nCause there's no dollars for nothing else\nI got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf\nNow everyday I see my momma struggling\nSo now its time I got to do something\nI look for work\nI get dissed like a jerk\nI do odd jobs\nAnd come home like a slob\nSo here comes Dogg his gold is shivery\nHe gives me two hundred for a quick delivery\nI do it once I do it twice\nAnd now there's stake with the beans and rice\nMy mothers nervous but she knows the deal\nMy sisters gear now has sex appeal\nMy brothers my partner and were getting paper\nAnd three months later the whole hood cought the vapors\nMy family's happy and everything is new\nNow tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\n\n[Interlude: Mac]\nAy yo yo Check this out Snoop\nAll these niggas always talking about\n\"They looove this\" And niggas got looove for you\nOr nigga I looove this ride or this chin around my neck nigga\nYou niggas don't know what the fuck love really mean\nNigga you can't buy love at no corner store nigga\nLove ain't got no price tag\nSnoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nHmm, money is flowing everything is fine\nI bought my self and Uzi and my brother a nine\nBusiness is booming everything is cool\nI pull about a G a week, fuck school\nA year passed by and I began to grow\nNot in height but juice and cash flow\nI kick up my feet to watch some t.v\nCause now I got other people working for me\nI got a 55\" television you know\nAnd every once in a while I hear \"Just say no\"\nOr the other commercial I love\nThat's when they say this is you brain on drugs\nI pick up the remote control and just turn\nCause with this bullshit I'm not concerned\nMe and my brother bounced in the Benz\nWe driving around our territory again\nI pull up at the light like a superstar\nAn automatic weapon cold sprayed my car\nI hit the accelerator scared as shit\nI drove one block to find my brother was hit\nHe wasn't dead but the blood was pouring\nAnd all I could think about was Warren\nLater I found it was Dogg and his crew\nNow tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\n\n[Interlude: Mac]\nYeah so now you see what I'm talkin' 'bout nigga\nYou see what that love shit do ya\nThis nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga done shot yo brother\nSo what the fuck you gon' do now\n\n[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]\nMy brother is out of it but I'm still in it\nOn top of that I'm in it to win it\nI can't believe that Dogg would dis me\nThat faggot that punk he soft or sissy\nI driving around with three of my guys\nThe war is on and I'm on the rise\nWe rolled right up to Dogg's favorite hang out\nWhat's cracking Dogg and let the bullets stang out\nSomeone shot back so we took cover\nAnd all I could about was my brother\nDogg jumped up and began to run\nBustin shots hoping to hit someone\nSo I just stopped and let off three shot\nTwo hit that nigga and one hit a cop\nI threw down the gun and began to shout\n\"Ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out\nNow as I left there goes the boys in blue\nThey pointin they guns at my four man crew\nThey shot down one, they shot down two\nNow tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do\n\n[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\nDoggz gonna get ya\n\n[Outro: Snoop Dogg]\nYa see the moral of the story is this\nLove is a motherfucka\nAnd Doggs is a motherfucka\nYou mix the two up you bound to get some drama\nLoves gonna get ya\nNaw nigga Doggz gonna get ya you ever try to play me and thats real\nThat's real\nThat's real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cc7312525ce26f443efc158446aeedc3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
