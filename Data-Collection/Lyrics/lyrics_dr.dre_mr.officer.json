See, you were doing 65 in a 35, and you ran a red light. That's reckless driving as far as I\u2019m concerned! Who else you got in there with you Jimbo, huh? What the hell is going on in here? Alright, everybody out of the vehicle right now!\n\n(Don't do it! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! God, don't shoot! Please don't shoot!)\n\nYou're a cop. I know you man. I know what you're thinking. You\u2019re thinking, \"We got us another crazy nigga here with a gun,\" well let me tell you something: Human life means very little to me at this point in time. You see, I thrive on misery. In the jungle, misery\u2019s all you got, but, things are different back here in the world, or so they seem. Nobody wants to talk about pain and suffering. Everybody wants everything to be nice and civil. Well, okay then. Let's be nice. Let\u2019s be civil. And let's drop those guns before I pull this trigger and change the way you feel about me!\n\n[Intro: RBX]\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nFool\nDon't you know before you bring home the bacon\nYou gotta kill the motherfucking pig first\n\n[Hook: RBX (x4)]\nMr. Officer, Mr. Officer\nI wanna see you laying in a coffin sir\n\n[Verse 1: Prince Ital Joe]\n[?] is dead, me say [?] is dead\nThem ass is dead\nThem ass is dead, dead, dead\n[?] is dead, me say [?] is dead\nThem ass is dead\nThem ass is dead, dead, dead\nThem beat up Rodney King, them no have no mercy\nWicked officer, them no love humanity\nThe Crips on the block, them a come to get [?]\n[?] buried under\n[?] is dead, [?] my people get bread\nL.A. riot [?] spread\nSoon [?] California get scared\nThem ass is dead\nDead, dead, dead\n\n[Interlude: Reporter]\n\"Yes, we have\u2014there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting.
