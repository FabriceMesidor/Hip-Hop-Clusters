I will take care of you baby girl.\n\nI'm in nevada with Hype lookin at spots for this new video we are shooting for that single I told you pac is going to be on once he is out, called California Love. We met a bunch of crazy, naked motherfuckers in the desert today, they were putting up some type of giant wood man. I guess they have a big party out here for a bunch of days. I asked them how much they pay, they said \"nothing\", I was like no money? Someone should get behind this shit and make some loot of these fools cause they said there will at least be 5,000 people. I think I will have my office look into it, just to see if there is easy money to be had here. I'm bout to pass out girl, wish I was up in that ass. See you back in LA.\n\nDre", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
