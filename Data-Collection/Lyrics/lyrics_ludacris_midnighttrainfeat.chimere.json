Chimere)\n\n[Chimere]\nOoh, hey yeah\nDo you know how to leave, ride...ride\n\n[Verse 1]\nYa see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash\nAnd it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh\nMy clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream\nAll you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's\nAnd I had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste\nCause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste\nSo let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire\nWill slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer\nLookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and\nHit the liquor store got up, got out and got something\nThat eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'\nMy blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken\nCamels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues\nAnd playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes\nComin' up slammin' Caddy doors\nIn Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest\nAnd we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest\nCause we ridin'\n\n[Chorus: Chimere]\nRidin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide\nRidin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that\nIt's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back\nI right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy\nI shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy\nCause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm\nSome livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn\nI still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed\nI'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said\nSippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends\nToday you see and then you cruise through the West end\nThey should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia\nThen underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older\nIf I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times\nI got em' all in check when it comes to bustin' rhymes\nDon't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd\nMy mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road\nI heard the squad was wiped up so I flipped my mode\nOn my way to D-E-C, baby can't you see\nThat Decatur is totally to B-I-G for thee\nLost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers\nYo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners\nIt's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down\nThey played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound\nNow my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked\nI should be gettin' it cause life is too got damn short\nAnd now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto\nBack to the C-P, I put the pedal to the metal\nGod bless the child that's just got his own\nSince I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home\nI'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road\nIt's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nCause it's the A-T-L\nWhere all the pimps and the playas just dwell\nWe get the cash and the ass then bail\nWe leave a trace but never leave a trail\nSay it again\nWhere all the pimps and the playas just dwell\nWe get the cash and the ass then bail\nWe leave a trace but never leave a trail\n\n[Chimere ad-libs to fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d211edacb8de02968540124c6801063d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
