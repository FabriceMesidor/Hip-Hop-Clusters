Do you sleep? Are you with me?\nWe used to be unspoken\nNow everything is broken, I'm a good son\nYou're a good son\nYou're a good son, oh\nYou're a good son\nOh, you're a good son\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Bridge: Childish Gambino]\nFree information, free information\nFree information, free informa\u2014 ma\u2014\n\n[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]\nArlanda, hotel to the bar\nYoung girl with an accent with her back bent\nAss out to the whole world\nWe can vibe out for tonight\nStepping outside for a light\nNo coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers\nSlow poke and I don't know 'bout photos\nLet's go though\nHow old are you?\nSaying that you never date older dudes\nThat's why I never wanna say no to you\nThe coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids\nThe coldest dude who can't hold his Goose (woo!)\n\"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?\"\nWhat about dude?\n\"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something\"\n\n[Interlude: Kilo Kish]\nIt took me like, five minutes to figure out\nWhat the voices those were, on the phone\nBut I figured it out...\n\n[Hook: Kilo Kish]\nIs it real 'cause you're online?\nIs it real 'cause you're online?\nIs it real 'cause you're online?\nIs it real ('cause you're on) line?\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Interlude]\nI'm a freaky bitch\nI am five foot eight, 390\nAnd I am a freaky bitch\n\n[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]\nHeathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing\nExistential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict\nCraftmatic, making moves but they sleeping on me\nWe can kick it like it's FIFA, homie, nevertheless\nI got that fresh like it was Crest, grind 'cause I'm stressed\nTMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living\nI never understood the hate on a nigga preference\nWhen every marriage is a same sex marriage\nSame sex everyday, monotonous, Lost God, never pray\nForgotten us, lost love, never say just like our parents\nToo much power ain't enough power\nBrain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower\nAnd anybody can walk into any Denny's\nAnd wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it\nKinison said if you gon' miss Heaven\nWhy do it by two inches? Old money and new bitches\nOld money and new bitches\n\n[Outro]\nGetting next level in a hotel\nAin\u2019t shit that we don\u2019t need, nigga, oh well", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b8c1f5981bc77ffd06580a1f2e693cf3.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
