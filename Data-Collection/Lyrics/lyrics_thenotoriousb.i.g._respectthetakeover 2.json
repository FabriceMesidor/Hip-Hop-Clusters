Get live motherfuckers!!\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream\nOn the drug scene, fuck a football team:\nRisking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen\nHearing the coach scream ain't lifetime dream!\nI mean I want to blow up, stack my dough up\nSo school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up\nMom said that I should grow up and check myself\nBefore I wreck myself, disrespect myself\nPut the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it\nScarface, King of New York, I want to be it\nRap was secondary, money was necessary\nUntil I got incarcerated--kinda scary\nC74-Mark 8 set me straight\nNot able to move behind the great steel gate\nTime to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?\nAll the money I stacked was all the money for bail\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/accf2df97375292b16f399ff6ec71e6e.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
