Fantastic,\u201d Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie Nickerson\n\nMcQueen related how the project came about\n\n\u201cMe and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, \u2018I\u2019m at Dover Street Market, where are you?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m at Dover Street Market,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That\u2019s Kanye: It\u2019s been a wild ride.\u201d\n\nThe director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-tops\n\nIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity\n\n\u201cAs a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn\u2019t been for my experience in Paris \u2014 learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,\u201d said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the show,\u201d he pleaded\n\nWhile a divisive figure in fashion \u2014 many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior \u2014 West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people \u201cthat work here, the city itself, the music that\u2019s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s ties to LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009\n\nMore recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d and \u201cNi\u2013as in Paris.\u201d\n\nA tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. \u201cWhen I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,\u201d West said\n\nTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity\n\nMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after\n\n\u201cHe fully got the color right. And it\u2019s so perfect, I\u2019m like, \u2018Don\u2019t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,\u2019\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy with it. It\u2019s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, \u2018Huh, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nKardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They\u2019ve been on my computer forever, \u201d she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brand\n\nLike West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a C\u00e9line style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar\n\n\u201cMy mom has the one that\u2019s just as is. So I feel like mine\u2019s a little special,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s a really dope coat,\u201d West concurred", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
