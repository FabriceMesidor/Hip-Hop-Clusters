Gotta have bricks\nYeah that makes sense\nYeah, I make hits\nBut I still take bricks\n\n[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]\nSo Icy C.E.O., I'm a fool with the snow\nThey think I'm putting VVS jewels in the coke\nMy watch a cool hundred, Paint-job a cold 20\nAnd after this flip, I'm quitting the trap cold-turkey...psych!\nThe pack in and I'm working\nDrought season in, charged your ass a whole 30\nBut right now you can get it for a low number\nThe fish scale white: same color my Hummer\nZone-6 polar bears never see Summer\nIt's Winter all year cause the birds fly under\n95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner\nI'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper\n\n[Chorus: Gucci Mane]\nBricks!\nAll-white bricks\nOff-white bricks\nLight-tan bricks\nJust hit a lick for fifty more bricks\nBalling like a bitch with all these bricks\nBricks!\nThirty-six zips\nThat's a whole chick\nWant a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks\nYeah that makes sense\nYeah, I make hits\nBut I still take bricks\n\n[Verse 2: Young Ralph]\nI'm like a waitress in the trap: I've got something to serve\nThat's 16 bars, same price for a bird\nWhat you need, a bird? Or a couple pounds?\nI'm on Cleveland Ave...you know my side of town\nSo many bricks I can build my own apartment\nYou better check when you come in my department\nYes I break em down and I sell em whole\nTry me, watch your whole crew fall like some dominoes\nI got a trap house and a trap car\n100,000 off a cap: that's a trapstar\nAll this smoke got me feeling real nauseous\nRiding with them bricks got me feeling real cautious\n\n[Chorus: Gucci Mane]\nBricks!\nAll-white bricks\nOff-white bricks\nLight-tan bricks\nJust hit a lick for fifty more bricks\nBalling like a bitch with all these bricks\nBricks!\nThirty-six zips\nThat's a whole chick\nWant a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks\nYeah that makes sense\nYeah, I make hits\nBut I still take bricks\n\n[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]\nTony Montana: \"All I have in this world\"\nIs my 100-round chopper and my white girl\nOil-based bricks, shit hard to cook\nCall the plug back, tell him he got took\nKnow what that mean, the shit free\nThat means none for him and more for me\nI took something, I'm gutter bitch\nDon't trust me dogg, this that North Memphis shit\nOld-school new Porsche\nCouple choppers just in case they wanna go to war\nBricks, aka my best friend\n28 inch rims: call em \"grown men\"\nDope stepped on, call it \"step-child\nI got that Slim Shady, we call it \"8 Mile\"\nI'm from North Memphis, Watkins and Brown\nGotti Street and nigga, that's my brick house", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50ff5a5cd7e11a90d1e37caf787a6b1.342x342x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
