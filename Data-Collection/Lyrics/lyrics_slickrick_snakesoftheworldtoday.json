Well, I carry a tray\nLet's call it self-defense if I blow you away\n\nYou (Snakes of the world today)\nYou (Snakes of the world today)\n\nOh, so now you're gonna front like you are one man\nI'll beat you down, 'cause they might lie and play me like I'm a fan\nBlood-suckers, I'm healin' that it's not on your side\nBut, honey, word's out, and your man's a duck\nFrom freeload city, he ain't worth a damn\nTryna come out on the scene tip like that-\nYes, you, little girl\nMore familiar faces\nDon't play brave or you'll need more than [*scratch*]\nSo, snakes unite\nRespect you'll never get\nYou sold your innocence to a royalty check\nAnd my words are true and they hold no mystery\nIt's written in the past and you cannot change history\n\n(Snakes of the world today)\n(Snakes of the world today)\n\nSo, you want me to bow\nWell, I'm sorry, Your Highness\nPayback is a witch for your undeserving kindness\nYour claim-to-fame is now properly over\nSo straighten up your life or go join Jehovah\nBricks through knives, thug's a played out user\nCountin' up your joints just like another loser\nAll you snakes, whassup\nYou think we're playin'\nYour mic styles weak like the man L was sayin'\nSo, cheerio, stream or vote, it was fun while it lasted\nYo, love's not the message for you, you white bastard\nYes we're supposed to play that we carry a tray\nWe'll call it self-defense when we blow you away\n\nYou (Snakes of the world today)\nYou (Snakes of the world today)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6641bdcd3119ba947560b22006b76cdd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
