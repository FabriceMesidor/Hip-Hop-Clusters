I take you to war now that my money long\nWhy you broke cats is by the bylines and fantasize\nThe way I'm spitting, put TV's in everything I sit in\nWhile I'm hot to death I'm gonna say this to all you player haters\nYa'll should hate the game not the players, come on\n\n[Chorus]\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\n\n[Verse 2]\nEveryday is bugged, niggas will come to a club\nTo try to show you they a thug instead of showing some love\nNow what you think you chump me if I let you bump me\nWhen I'm about to make a mill faster than you make a G?\nI know I lie, it's a habit, I vow to clean the city like the mayor\nAnd in the crack game I'm a franchise player\nNiggas be thinking I be out to lunch with mines\nThen in crunchtime I start hitting 'em hard with punchlines\nYou cats got to be sick to think 50 can't spit\nBetter check my batting average, I always make hits\nMy flow leave these rap cats petro, all across the metro\nPlus I pack a cannon up under my Marc Buchanan\nThey fake, they look like money, but ain't worth half the cake\nHave me running from Jake in a GS with bad brakes\nThey want to knock the take for Christ sakes\n\n[Chorus]\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, son remember them fake players who try to play us\nAt *The Shark Club* in Vegas\nHad them tight linen blazers and beat up gators\nLooking like last year's players\nYeah, I could tell they dough was low when we came through the do'\nI copped a case of Cristal, he copped one bottle of Mo\nFrom the look in the dude's face and the bulge in his waist he holding\n(Yeah he's packing, I can see his rack\nThe one in the middle, he a big man, I dealt with him, son)\nYeah, so I expect look like they ain't had a run since '81\nThey ain't here on a hunt for food\nSo they could catch you some cash and expensive jewels\nI'm gonna crash 'em with this bottle if he move\nI ain't the one, son, my shit ain't come easy\nIt won't go easy, believe me\n\n[Chorus]\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\nI change places to prevent catching the cases\nRaces in the faces tie like shoelaces\nThis is a hit, let's see if homicide trace this\n(Fifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this)\n\n[Outro]\nFifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this\nFifty-Cent, let's see if homicide trace this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/215f4f7cb4a9f86cfeff61aea6f1736d.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
