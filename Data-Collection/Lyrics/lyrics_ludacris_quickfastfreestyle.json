Listen!\n\n[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nPolo slippers, I'm a G, bitch!\nJust did a show, been counting paper for a week, bitch\n3 sips, I'll tear the club up like 3-6\nHanging with nines that could cause a solar eclipse\nLuda! It's lunar how I maneuver in the night time\nIf it's bad bitches, it's the right time\nVintage Rolex, time pieces that last a life time\nWhenever I decide to show up, that's my flight time\nTell the pilot I'm about to roll a doobie up\nLouis'd up, bitches want a snack, Scooby Doo me up\nRuby'd up, fruity colored diamonds cause I'm movied up\nWomen screw me up, love me down then they chew me up\nJust gettin' started, it's about to get solidified\nLyrical genocide, Ludacris has been identified\nAs one of the greats of all time, what am I to do?\nGeneration pimps, granddaddy and my father too\nWhat the fuck are y'all thinking, this is heaven sent\n8 albums in, other rappers are irrelevant\nIt's evident that I'm so elegant and intelligent\nThese other clowns sound like they rapping with speech impediments\nOl' dribble mouth niggas, y'all should lay it up\nPlay it up, talking about your life like you made it up\nWell here's a story for the ages, I'm a living legend\nAnd my security guards are named Smith & Wesson\n\n[Outro: Ludacris talking]\nFuck an adlib on this one, man, let it ride\nThis for the fans, I love y'all, baby\nLudaversal, March 31st! I'm trynna fucking tell y'all\nBest album I ever did, nigga.
