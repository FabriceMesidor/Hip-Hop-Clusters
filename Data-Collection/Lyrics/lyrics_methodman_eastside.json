(Moon)\nI never been ordinary, carry weapons more than heavy (Come on)\nMind was designed to be primed 'cause I'm more than ready (Right)\nIf you sharpen your machete, better get that coffin ready\nRun up in your crib, I fuck your wife and eat up your spaghetti (Fuck 'em)\nAll I do is write rhymes, smoke trees and pipe dimes (Uh huh)\nHustle all day then continue through the nighttime

Protect Ya Neck, dog?\nNot X, dog, love some DMX\nI am practically DM an X, dog\nMatter fact my next bar colder\nBetter yet, it's hot yoga\nYou get stretched forward, dog\nDo respect, I don't respect y'all\nThat said, I'ma keep the track fed (Woo)\nLook, if he ain't dead, he better act dead\nP-L-O forever, peace to Achmed (Hey)\nType to say what's crackin' to a crackhead\nBlacker than your face, that's a blackhead (Ah)\nNeed to be Proactive\nThese rap kids need to know the meanin' of what rap is\nBefore they say they rappers\nI can say I mastered everything they talkin' 'bout\nAnd after it's

Dogg]\nI'm sorry to keep you waitin' 'cause I've been cultivatin'\nThuggish through my duration\nDoin' public relations\nCountin' money, doin' TV shows\nI can't believe he goes underground then mainstream\nSuper supreme and the cream rules everything (Yup)\nYou fools do a lot of talkin' but you never swing\nAnd that's on everything\nSee, I'm a king so I look upon my scruples\nAnd then pinpoint which one will be my next pupil\nConcentrated, it's levels and layers\nDevils and players, Joker's Wild\nWhile I'm strokin' her down, we'll be smokin' a pound\nAnd we came to par-tay, three the hard way\nJohnny Blaze, Snoop Dogg and my nephew\nYou can't smoke with us, nigga, we left you\nIn the dust (What?), on the bus (What?) homie, we don't give a fuck (What?)\nLong Beach, nigga, east side\n\n[Chorus: iNTeLL]\nI said shout out to the west side\nBut I'm from the east side (Okay)\nAnd you know that we ride (Okay)\nBumpin' hard beats off the G ride (Yeah)\nThrowin' up the peace sign, lookin' for some feline\nCrushin' Power-U, that's how I do\nI said shout out to the west side\nBut I'm from the east side\nAnd you know that we ride (Yeah)\nBumpin' hard beats off the G ride (Uh
