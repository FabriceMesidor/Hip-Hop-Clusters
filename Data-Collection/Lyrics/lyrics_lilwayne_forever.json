Straight up gangsta, Hollygrove gangsta\nLay a nigga down in pink stuff\nThem soft ass dudes just think tough\nWe shoot and put them shanks up\nWe tryin' live to summer and put them minks up\nI'm sinked up in the coupe, the eyes chinked up\nPull up on a bitch at the light, that night linked up\nWhole lotta shit in the life of a young boss\nBet that V.V.S. ice will bite your face off\nYeah, I ignite and take off, now catch up\nI'm the best doing it, c'mon niggas 'fess up\nNigga feel different he could chess up and guess what\nI bring it to his chest, to his right lung and left lung\nNigga get a check up, nigga put ya cheque up\nI swear I'm on fire, need water like a hick-up\nSo I guess I might as well can say that\nI'm the best today and (Forever)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, candy paint!
