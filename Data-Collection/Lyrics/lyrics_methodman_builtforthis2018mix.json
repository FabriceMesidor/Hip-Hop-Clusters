Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga\nUp before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers\nTell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb, bust\nOn these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up\nWestside! Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga\nFinger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas\nI love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back\nI get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at\nRidin', passed by while these niggas wondered why\nI got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try\nDid I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed\nFor all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'\n\n[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]\n\nFire up the la let\u2019s go take a ride\nThey might catch you by surprise if you let em slide\nBut if you\u2019re built for this shit then you might survive\nGuess I\u2019ll see you when you wake up on the other side\n\n[Verse 3: Ice Cube]\nThe world is mine nigga get back\nDon't mess with my stack the gauge is racked\nAbout to drop the bomb I'm the Westcoast don\nBig fish in a small pond\nNow the feds trying to throw they book at the crook\nBut I shook they worm and they hook\nGuppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy\nRunning everything westside of the Mississippi\nIts the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring\nWe got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up\nBow down before I make a phone call\nGot 25 niggas running up on y'all\nFor the cheese we want them keys\nEverybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please\nBefore any of you guppies get heart\nNigga rewind my part fool\n\n[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]\n\nFire up the la let\u2019s go take a ride\nThey might catch you by surprise if you let em slide\nBut if you\u2019re built for this shit then you might survive\nGuess I\u2019ll see you when you wake up on the other side\n\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nNow everybody wanna see us dead\nTwo murdered on the front page\nShot to death, bullets to the head\nNiggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape\nMotherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves\nWatch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound\n\u2018Cause Trick don't give a fuck\nWhere you coward niggas now?\nBlast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'\nBusters thought we was frontin'\nSo reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'\n\n[Verse 5: Eazy-E]\n\nSeven-thousand, four hundred, twenty three grains\nOf sand drop from the hourglass\nIt's how much time I got left on this planet\nSome motherfucker's gotta die!\nI'm an evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up\nI'm gonna put these things on you, and never let up\nSee, my momma...she was wrong when I was born\nThat a nigga like E should'a never been born\nToo late, big mistake in '72\nIt's '92, now the year of code blue\n15 hours..11 minutes..30 seconds\nI'm a motherfuckin' wreck\nGonna pay back niggas who did me wrong in the past\nMy days ain't long\nI'm comin' strong and fast\nLock up 8 niggs..kill up 10 pigs\nInnocent and fuckers are also dyin, too\nNow what else can I do?\nFuck, fuck, fuck and plant my seeds\nLeavin' kids in this world like me\nThe lunatic psycho mutherfucka Eazy-E\n\n[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]\nFire up the la let\u2019s go take a ride\nThey might catch you by surprise if you let em slide\nBut if you\u2019re built for this shit then you might survive\nGuess I\u2019ll see you when you wake up on the other side", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe6629f7a5e6af0aa38ca87547ced96f.1000x562x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
