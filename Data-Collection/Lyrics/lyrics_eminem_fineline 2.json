And do I take more than I need?\nWhen I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'\n'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even\n\n[Hook: Luis Resto]\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo a martyr is how I paint myself\nAnd through my harrowin' ordeals I\u2019m so vain I want my respect\nBut ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect\n'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect\nAnd my reflection shows what it's like here\n'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights\nYeah, it's like a nightmare\nI said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror\nAnd I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah\n'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might\nSay a prayer twice just to make sure God hears\n'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it\nBut I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player\nI got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair\nAway from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from\nAnd this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it\nAnd I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it\nBut it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it\nSo I bitch about my life then make another song\nVicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous\nI keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old\nBut especially when you don\u2019t know\nIf your conscience is sayin' I told you so\n'Cause you don't even know anymore\nIf you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul\n\n[Hook: Luis Resto]\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd from here you look so small\nHovering high above us all\nPlease come back to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI still remember the times when\nThey were simpler than the rhymes of\nVanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics\nI'll never forget what that feeling was like\nI miss those times now when I was just starting out\nWithout a dime and now I'm diamond\nI can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been\nStuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside\nIt sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'\nI just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it\nLook how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and\nEverything about it I miss, which now reminds me\nPut a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz\nWow, I must have had Alzheimer's\nLong time since I shouted them out, 'bout time\n'Cause it's been on my mind lately how\nZee, you always supported me\nYou vouched, I will never forget that and\nHow you guys accepted me for me and Pace\nI love you too, you slept on my couch\nAnd I've been thinkin' 'bout the time\nWhen I slept on the floor at The Outhouse\nRhyming's all we ever wanted to do\nAnd regardless how life has turned out\nInside I'll, I'll always be an outsider\nMy life has been turned inside out but I\u2014\n\n[Hook: Luis Resto]\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\nI know, it's a fine, fine line\nLiving in hope or dire need\n\n[Outro]\nBut I keep walkin' the line...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acc348ccdf6bd18c7aee7ae7c6c3d865.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
