With who you say?\nI wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?\nYou went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame\nKeep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg\nYou fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake\nAnd Lupe? You wanna loose two legs?\nYou tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say\n\"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?\" \u2014 Well, screw you\nAnd I'll be the third person who screwed you today\nOh, fourth\u2014Dre, Drake, Lupe\u2014oohm, touch\u00e9\nYou were too two-faced for me\nThought you was my number one true-blue ace\nBut you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face\n'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache\nYou're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself\nYou make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid\nHere's what you say to someone you hate\n\n[Chorus]\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead?\nI would feel so much, much better\n\n[Verse 2]\nThink I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink\nHop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think\n'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em\nI'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink\nI'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes\nBut bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!\nExcuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm\nChannelin' my anger through every single station that's on!\n'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, \"he-art\"\n'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage\nWho do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off\nAnd pick myself up off the carpet\nBut I'll never say the L-word again\nI lo-lo-lo-lo\u2026 lesbian!\nAaahhh! I hope you hear this song\nAnd go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead?\nI would feel so much, much better\n\n[Bridge]\n'Cause you told me\nYou'd love me\nForever\nBitch, that was a lie\nNow I never\nWanted someone to die\nSo bad in my fuckin' life\nBut fuck it, there\u2019s other fish in the sea\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I'ma have a whale of a time\nBein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of\nOne to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of\nCatches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)\nI might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made\nFor me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her\nThese bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of\nMy bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer\nLike I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch\nBut bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch\nBitch, you complain when you listen to this\nBut you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch\nThat's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site\nLong as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike\nSo all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid\nI avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed\nOye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's\nGettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink\nYou fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink\nI got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one\nShe's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun\nI'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song\nAnd go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just\nDrop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes\n\n[Chorus]\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead (I hate you)\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead? (Bitch)\nI would feel so much, much better\n\n[Outro]\nI'm just playin', bitch\nYou know I love you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c354260f9edc6b2e9bf6b06c935a0b8.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
