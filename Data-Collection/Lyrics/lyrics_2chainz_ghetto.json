You know, it's a living arrangement, it's a living situation. You know, but I'm thankful for everything that I've been through, for every seed that's been planted. You know, everything that grew on me. You dig what I'm sayin'? I come from that. I'm goin' this way, though. You dig what I'm sayin'? Yeah, straight up, a ghetto child, though, man. Super duper blessed, man, super duper blessed. Really anointed, anointed by the Lord so you know, I'm supposed to be here, you know what I'm sayin'? But excuse me, please, excuse me.
