Y'all do the math\nNow the third, you probably heard from MOP\nThey say use them rocks to make 'em envy\nEnvy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony\nWhen niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity\nThey hate it, to see you celebrated\nCounting my paper, nigga, you could have made it\nLet me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth\nWhere niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth\nWant you to break em off, getting money it costs\nFor you to be a boss, ain't no taking off\nNow the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat\nIt\u2019s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street\nIt\u2019s a dude that\u2019s getting paid in full, cars and jewels\nSo his plate is full, but the way this nigga move\nHe is never full and he gon' want your food\nDon't overdo it, that's an underrated rule\nThe sixth is a fix that's in all of us\nWhen I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust\nWhen the drawers go down, the guards go down\nCause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now\nOkay, the seventh is a seed that many believe\nIs the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed\nKnew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other\nGreed is a mother, it\u2019s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff\nCops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off\nBefore I sign off, in the sins we livin'\nThe good thing is we can be forgiven\n\n[Outro]\nSeven deadly sins", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e188205739dfac1fc84a3288836b46ff.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
