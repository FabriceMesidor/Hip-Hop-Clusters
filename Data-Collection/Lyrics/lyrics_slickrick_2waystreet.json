To discharge in a sister\nNext thing, in the dressin' room, \"Pardon me, mister\"\nYes, I said cautiously, \"Crazy, but possibly you could sign\nYour name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me\"\nTry to resist, now girlfriend startin' it\nThe pen won't write, \"You can press down hard on it\"\nNow, my hand browsin' her South end\nSpun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when\n(Rring!) Loosen the grip my hell had\nMy girl, she was talkin' so nice I felt bad\nBeing untrue, no tellin' what it might do to her\n\"I love you\", forced to say, \"I love you back, too\" to her\nAny thought of gettin' pussy was doomed too\n\"You got a wife?\", anniversary comin' up soon, too\nGot off the phone, cock just got mute\n\"Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute\" (Uh-huh)\nI'm wrong for mistreatin' her, the wantin' to skeetin' her\n\"I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya\"\nWhat an angel overcomin' his wrongness\nThe moral I am tryin' to get across in this song is\n\n[Hook]\nIf goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with\nAnd wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with\nWho keeps no secret, like who they creep with\nRealize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)\nIf goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with\nAnd wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with\nWho keeps no secret, like who they creep with\nRealize early, it's a 2 way street, kid\n\n[Verse 2]\nCasually seatin' with some thick chords eatin'\nWith my album playin' at a big board meetin'\n\"I love this!\"\nBeing the coolest and the ruffest\nA big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office\nAnd fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went\n'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment\nPoundin' was inevitable\nShe said to me, \"Rick, I think your album is incredible\"\nThe way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I\n\"You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye\"\n\"Well, I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya\nMeans a lot to me, comin' from a woman of your stature\"\nI mean, who could resist the Don head?\nStart caressin' Rick private, kiss me on the neck\nAnd I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull\nGirlfriend pussy look plump and poundable\nShe sweats to set the emperor\nPut one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya\nFantastic, though I start to act drastic\nWhen I see my weddin' band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek\nDeep down, she felt that I tried to diss\nI'm like, \"I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss\"\nAn angel overcomin' his wrong, kids\nThe point that I am tryin' to get across in this song is\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73539fff4e6ebc470e6cab73853f0ac6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
