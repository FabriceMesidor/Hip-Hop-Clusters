I do not know what to tell you\nI'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening\nI need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself\nI need someone I leave through the front door with\n'Cause we don't wanna hide no more\nPlus you're not shy no more\nNeither of us wanna play the side no more\nNo, I'm not alone\nEven though nothing was the same\nLet me get your ass alone\nLet me make you say my name\nSay my name\n\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nSay my name, say my name\nWhen no one is around you\nSay, \"Baby, I love you\"\nIf you ain't running games\nSay my name, say my name\nYou actin' kinda shady, baby\nWhy the sudden change?\nSay my name\nSay my name\nSay my name\nSay my name, say my name\nIf no one is around you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ba2bb761bfd076d102cac36214aa4283.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
