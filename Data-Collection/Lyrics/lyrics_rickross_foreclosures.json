Sometimes, being in the position I am, with no malicious intent, my nigga, you can take it how you want it. I see it from both sides, I feel a nigga pain\n\n[Verse 1]\nLearn to walk a tightrope\nEver seen a rich nigga go broke?\nThey putting liens on a nigga's things\nPublicize your demise, and by all means\nYour family fortune is forever what you stood on\nSold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on\nYou reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions\nTo the culture itself, these are powerful lessons\nThese niggas always smiled when I came around\nThey let you know my reputation when you in my town\nA real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract\nBottom line blood, show me where them one\u2019s at\nThat paper it get funny when publishing is involved\nMechanicals never mattered because that was your dog\nNow you hands-on, but things don\u2019t ever seem right\nYou make a call to give your lawyer the green-light\nHe look into it then hit you up with the bad news\nIt\u2019s so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes\nMafioso, baby girl, cash rules\nEvery dollar accounted for, double M the crew\n\n[Hook]\nDeath Row, fast life\nForeclosed on my past life\nThe white man call us stupid niggas\nWe spend it all, nothing for our children\nHad it all, now it\u2019s repossessed\nCan\u2019t feed the clique cutting bad checks\nTime to learn boy, that cash rules\nSuccess is a precious jewel\n\n[Verse 2]\nPlanting poison in a nigga mind\nChilling with your boys when it\u2019s time to grind\nWe both come from those humble beginnings\nStill can\u2019t believe we never followed each other on Twitter\nFunny thing is the animosity money brings\nReal niggas out of style we may be one in three\nBack against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys\nOne bullet, one target, one choice\nYou can take an L or take the shell\nIt's still double M still making mills\nMade niggas respect my hustle on both coasts\nI put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest\nI need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest\nYou still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches\nAnd I never took an L back when Meek fell\nJust drove the numbers all the way back up at retail\n\n[Hook]\nDeath Row, fast life\nForeclosed on my past life\nThe white man call us stupid niggas\nWe spend it all, nothing for our children\nHad it all, now it\u2019s repossessed\nCan\u2019t feed the clique cutting bad checks\nTime to learn boy, that cash rules\nSuccess is a precious jewel\n\n[Verse 3]\nCan\u2019t be writing checks with your eyes closed\nWhile you living out of homes in different time zones\nMind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones\nPistol to your ear, this that level I\u2019m on\nI apologize woadie but this all I got\nEverybody in this office we could die tonight\nI never met an artist who fully recouped\nThese the deals the deal  dealers wanna deal to you\nYoung niggas, time to act your wage\nBuying belts you seen on other niggas waists\nHoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online\nWhole time, shorty knowing I\u2019m not gon' mind\nPut it on all he needed was a co sign\nBlack minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine\nTV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine\nYou\u2019ll foreclose or fold just for soul signs\n\n[Hook]\nDeath Row, fast life\nForeclosed on my past life\nThe white man call us stupid niggas\nWe spend it all, nothing for our children\nHad it all, now it\u2019s repossessed\nCan\u2019t feed the clique cutting bad checks\nTime to learn boy, that cash rules\nSuccess is a precious jewel\n\n[Outro]\nSuccess is a precious jewel\nSuccess is a precious jewel", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c596685b5b772d11df2f1cfd83cab941.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
