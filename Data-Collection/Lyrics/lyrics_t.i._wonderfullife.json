And this pain I feel it never goes away\nDoes it? This load I carry get no lighter\nI grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home\nTaught me everything I\u2019ve known, owe you everything I own\nI must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book\nHope you proud of me, didn\u2019t graduate from college but\nThanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up\nTil we meet in person let\u2019s keep speaking through my verses for life\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n[Outro: Akon]\nThis is your song...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c270013a37f81fa5c7f0606f8824d12.300x300x1.png"}], "artist": "T.I."}
