{"songs": [{"title": "Pandemonium", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Three passports, three first class\nTickets to the money, straight flights\n\nI live by the code, wardrobe from 'round the globe\nAll I need is a kilo, an apron, show me the stove\nGeneral Electric, perfected, cooking them O's\nNo more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves\n\nHoes, I need a condom for my toast\nBusting in these niggas standing flat footed, I'm on my toes\nFroze, pandemonium overdose\nPaparazzi in the trees, please, curtains closed\n\nArmadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf\nHeroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff\nPlaying for keeps, I busting 'em 'fore she get off\nI run the city, just pull up and drop the kid off, ha\n\nWelcome to organized crime\nMoney got me excited, I'm coming four or five times\nThe '45 for you niggas with 9 lives\nPenthouse on college money, long as Ocean drive\n\nBlack Chevy Tahoe's, stations up the potholes\nMy place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos\nFeds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue\nIssue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss\n\nCounting money stacks, yours' counterfeited\nI made my money back when your accountant didn't\nWent against the odds, it's only one Rozay\nMy nigga okay\n\nI got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk\nStarted in the back, now we the niggas in the front\nStep out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock\nGet a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop\n\nPandemonium, causing pandemonium\nHalf a million for the same car we rolling in\nPandemonium, pandemonium\nWe the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it\n\nMillion ways to make this money, you gon' get it\nOn the grind 24/7 I'm with it\nYSL swagger, wrist wear frigid\nJumping out the Phantom like a motherfucking midget\n\nMoney knocking at the front door, I'm like, who is it?\nIt's Benjy, tell my lil nigga, go and get it\nCause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute\nLamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm gon' spend it\n\nI'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it\nThree's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it\nFour for my niggas that be stacking and then blowing it\nYou would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in\n\nLook at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium\nPapi got them keys in, he like my custodian\nI was trying to bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon\nI was in them trenches, getting down and dirty serving it\n\nWe's part of the reason that them churches got some services\nThe morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering\nNigga called my phone, talking reckless, I ain't heard of it\nFuck ya girl, give her back, I'm courteous\n\nI can keep a secret with Vicky, have a menage with Nicki\nAnd be out London with Lauren and telling Meagan good morning\nCatch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton\nWith Paris from Hollywood to the hood\n\nI want a mom and I swear that I want 'em all, wanna fuck 'em all\nHad my niggas down so I'm screaming fuck the law\nMonday night wrestling, I'm so fucking Raw\nShe gon' wipe me down, I'm gon' brush her off\n\nI'm way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak\nWord to the homies Ross, I can get that 9 Piece\nFor the low that 9 cheap, call me if you want it\nHaters see me and I'm staying got 'em sick to they stomach\n\nI got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk\nStarted in the back, now we the niggas in the front\nStep out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock\nGet a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop\n\nPandemonium, causing pandemonium\nHalf a million for the same car we rolling in\nPandemonium, pandemonium\nWe the number one niggas, your bitch notice it\n\nWhole time, see that fly shit I've been on\nAll the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off\nThat's game bitch ain't shit, nudies and some J six\nWhere I'm from, it's cold and niggas get at you like handkerchiefs\n\nGod bless you unless you was disrespectful\nBitches disappoint you but money won't ever stress you\nThey say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down\nSo all that shit you niggas kicking with worried about\n\nCatch me at the carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half\nFlyest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad, bitch I got a right to brag\nBitch, I got a right to boast\nPresidential suite and bitch and I never use my right to vote\n\nMy vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous\nAnd I am dead serious, bitch, I spit with embalming\nShout out to lil G, shout out Tre and Mohammad\nThat BOA shit we get paid with death over dishonor\n\nI'm known as Obama's don't, I know no one in Congress\nThese bitches love me all the way, you got sort of's and kind of's\nSort of remind you, why you don't call no vagina\nJust give 'em awesome intercourse and ignore there inquires\n\nQuietly becoming a top ten, you dreamed of getting cream\nBest believe I'm John Deere, Smith, greenist Moncler shit\nEarth tones in the winter, Purp rolled in a rillo\nI am on my John Lithgow\n\nOut of this 3rd Rock, nigga it out\nI am on my Tom Brady, y'all niggas is Eric Crouch\nWhat the blood clot, Tommy Frazier, fuck yourself\nI can see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch\n\nHere for breakfast, fuck for lunch\nDinner time she bring a friend, write my shit so vicious\nY'all are like snitches you can't see the pen\nAlways on some new shit CNN, shitting on these niggas like I need a pen\n\nI got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk\nStarted in the back, now we the niggas in the front\nStep out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock\nGet a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop\n\nPandemonium, causing pandemonium\nHalf a million for the same car we rolling in\nPandemonium, pandemonium\nWe the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6929169de7116d41676151bdea5cc773.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
