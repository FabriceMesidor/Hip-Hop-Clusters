Blige]\nWhat you hear is not a test, im rockin to the beat [x2]\nSee me and my crew, and my friends were gonna try to move our feet\nSee i am Mary Blige and i'll like to say hello\nTo the black to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow\nFirst you gotta................first you gotta", "image": "https://images.genius.com/085828b7d79bf8cf068b1557ca7a5e4c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Missy Elliott"}
