Let's all get on down!\nLet's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time\nDon't be scared, \u2018cause there ain't nothin' to worry about\nLet your hair down, and square dance with me!\nC'mon now!

(Woo-hoo!)\nPsychotic, hypnotic product, I got the antibiotic\nAin't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada\nGod, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la\nOochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta\nKeep movin', there's more music to make\nKeep makin' new shit, produce hits to break\nThe monotony, what's gotten into me?\nDrugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm 'Pac, on my enemies\nOn your knees, got you under siege\nSomebody you would give a lung to be\nHungry like a fuckin' younger me\nFuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free\nYeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny: I have the money\nTo have you killed by somebody who has nothin'\nI'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y\nLet's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nC'mon now! Let's all get on down!\nLet's do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time\nDon't be scared, \u2018cause there ain't nothin' to worry about\nLet your hair down, and square dance with me!\nC'mon now!
