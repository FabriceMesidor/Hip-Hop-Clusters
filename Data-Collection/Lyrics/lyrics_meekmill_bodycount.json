I'm double digits\nThirty birds I'm thinkin' we gon need another kitchen\nI used to pack my little work fuck up my mother dishes\nNow I'm the one to get the word to get a couple pigeons\nThen we cook em up, and let 'em dry\nWe break it down, and let em fly\nSend em to the hood, and tell em bye\nAll my niggas liftin weight but we dont exercise\nHa!\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nWhat's your body count nigga?\nI'm double digits\nWhat you talkin' bout nigga?\nIt's time to get it\nBad bitches in the house\nThey all exquisite\nCouple million in the couch\nRight here where I'm sittin'\nWhat's your body count nigga?\nI'm double digits\nWhat you talkin' bout nigga?\nIt's time to get it\nBad bitches in the house\nThey all exquisite\nCouple million in the couch\nRight here where I'm sittin'\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nMurder after murder, nigga you ain't heard\n'Cause when it come to beef, I'm puttin' bread all on my burger\nMan them shooters be so hungry\nWith bodies on they burner\nI could send em to your crib\nAnd once they spot you and confirm ya\nThey gon tear you out the frame\nFuckin' rip your picture\nSend a message to your homie just to make him get the picture\nAnd if they tellin on me\nI could make em hit the witness\nThey been off 'em like a summons\nDawg don't make me give 'em business\nTalkin all that killa shit now what's your body count\nShotty bounce will make your motherfuckin' body bounce\nWe on the graveyard shift where all the bodies found\n[?] on twenty-threes\nThem make the ride it bounce\nAh\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nWhat's your body count nigga?\nI'm double digits\nWhat you talkin' bout nigga?\nIt's time to get it\nBad bitches in the house\nThey all exquisite\nCouple million in the couch\nRight here where I'm sittin'\nWhat's your body count nigga?\nI'm double digits\nWhat you talkin' bout nigga?\nIt's time to get it\nBad bitches in the house\nThey all exquisite\nCouple million in the couch\nRight here where I'm sittin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/444ab187fd5c557d6d65efc6fb8931ea.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
