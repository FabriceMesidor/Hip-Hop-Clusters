You can't be me\nShorty gave me that ass on GP\nRolling in a G-500, or the Porsche, roof open\nAnd I know that you're hoping that I fall real soon\nBut I ain't going nowhere, hate to bust your balloon\nAnd there ain't that much room for all us\nLimited space, the game like a tour bus\nI won't break, I just take, take and take\nRape and rape, the game 'til there's no more cake\nSnitch ass niggas giving up identities\nAin't my fault they making pennies\nThey soft like ice cream, sweeter than Ben & Jerry's\nLike Hoffa, leave him nowhere to be found, but buried\nThe gun won't fail me, the money won't leave me\nStop scheming on me baby, cause it ain't that easy\nNiggas leave prints cause their palms so greasy\nTheir mind read easy, I see right through 'em\nThe AK'll do 'em, like nobody do 'em, stop\nIt's best that you keep it moving, you'll get shot\n\n[Hook: Havoc]\nWe ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air\nNo warning shots, the fuck out of here\nOh man homie, hate to do you like this\nOh man homie, when the tooley go click, click, click\n\n[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]\nIt's the young high-roller, the talk of New York\nDavid got my neck looking like a lightning bolt\nI'm in that two-door Range Stormer, my truck plush\nAnd the wheels are the size of rims on a school bus\nI need that Bill Gates money, that's fifty-one billion\nSix hundred ki's, that's fifty-one million\nMe and 50 in Hollywood, with Quincy Jones\nSince the Feds bought Nextel, I trashed my phone\nListen homes, everything glisten homes\nYeah, my gun and my rims both sit on chrome\nYou move your weight in the car, I move weight by the carload\nI dropped in Marcy in a Murcielago\nMy connect is a Cuban named Flaco\nWith my aim, you a human taco\nMeeting shells, yo the feds tryna peep our sales\nMy daughter grow up, she in Harvard and Yale, yeah\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Prodigy]\nYou see me rolling, Mac-10 showing out the window\nWhen you catching me shooting out the Coupe, then switch your lane\nYou don't want me creeping two miles an hour, with my seat low\nCause I'll hop up out the sunroof with fully-autos and embed it in your brain\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nIt's like fee, fie, foe, fum\nI smell the blood of a jealous ass punk\nOne, two, three hundred shots\nFitting to ring off them things off, and cook the block\nOld people, the pets and the kids\nWhoever in the way, them strays gon' hit\nAnd we don't give a fuck about the police nigga\nThis ain't Manhattan, this Queens nigga\nWe're immune to the violence, it's nothing to me\nFuck 'em, they don't give a fuck about P\nIf they could kill me, believe me, they would\nThat's why I set it off, and I get 'em real good\nWhen them street, lights, come on nigga\nYou best, have, your gun on nigga\nCause tonight we ride (Growl) and you die (Growl)\nAs soon as I walk up, or drive-by\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/796af50ac59c2535e57e1fca6de975b5.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
