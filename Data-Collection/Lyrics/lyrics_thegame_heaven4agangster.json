For people would become lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, too arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous without self-control. Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. This calls for wisdom. Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast. fuck Donald Trump, homie\n\n[Chorus]\nIs there heaven 4 a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (Uhh)\nIs there heaven 4 a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (Uhh)\nIs there heaven 4 a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (Uhh)\nIs there heaven 4 a gangsta, gangsta, gangsta? (Uhh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nGod, forgive me for my sins\nWorld full of bitch niggas\nLord, keep me out the pen\nKeep my sons on the right track\nMy daughter on her momma side\nLet the wind hit my baby face, its gonna be homicide\nYou don't father like I father, nigga\nI father kids and I father niggas\nI done been on Lil\u2019 Yachty\nShot Crips with Lil\u2019 Uzi\nGot bricks from the Migos\nAnd my bitch is bad and boujee\nEvery time I turn around\nSomebody trying to sue me\nAnd old friends turn colors, like Notorious B.I.G.
