I like to say \"was\" cause we gon' bring it to fruition wishing that it's gonna stop. You know and uh, all the violence that was going on - it happens in Chicago but it's happening around the world in many ways. You know, it may not be to the numbers that's happening in Chicago but it's happening in the inner cities all over America so we's talking about the conditions of what's happening when I said \"Nobody Smiling\" but it's really a call to action", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da2fdc7c193c18298bea9e26345db08a.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
