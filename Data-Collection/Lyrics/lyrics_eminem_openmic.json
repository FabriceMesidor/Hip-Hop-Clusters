I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all\nNigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first\nYou can bust yours after me if you want to\nNo, no, man, I'm goin' first\nI'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man\nYou always rap first, I'm rappin'\nI don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh\n\n[Hook: Thyme]\nAyo, who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Man, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\nI said who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Bitch, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed\nThe way you're hacked and sliced\nWhen I fill your back with knives\nJackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan\nFor blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband\nI stomped your man, so unless you want what he got\nYou better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot\nI make the D hot, people get in my face and ask\nIf I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask\nIt's an amazin' task to battle with success\nI never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less\nAnd win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians\nInvisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions\nWicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you\nWhen I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra\nSo feel the force of my spiritual images\nSlicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages\nMy skin itches every time a rapper recites\nAnd when he's through with his verse\nI'm all covered in flea bites\nYou wanna see fights, I got a match for ya\nYou couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula\n\n[Hook: Thyme]\nAyo, who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Man, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\nI said who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Bitch, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nYou bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me\nYou wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me\nIntellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier\nInferior, deteriorate, like bacteria\nMaterially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see\nHow much in fear when you hear me you'll be\nShiver and shake, quiver and quake\nBite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache\nWither and break, you slitherin' snake\nGibberin' fake, fibber and flake\nI'll twist you in a different shape\nAnd toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake\nIf this is a dream, you wish you can wake\nEvery diss you can take, personal\nWe ain't friends tryin' to make amends\nIf you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense\nI make intense masterpieces\nAnd smash to pieces your last releases\nYou pass diseases, that's the reason\nI'm showin' you the proper way to\nOperate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato\nI've never been less than clever and fresh\nSeverin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest\n\n[Hook: Thyme]\nAyo, who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Man, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\nI said who the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nPoint him out! Bitch, I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\n\n[Outro: Thyme]\nWhhhooo the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?!\nPoint him out! I wanna know\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\n\"I wanna know, I wanna know\"\n(Ayo, let me get that mic, man)\nWho the fuck passed you the mic\nAnd said that you can flow?\nWho the fuck passed you the mic?!\nWho the fuck passed you the mic?!\n(I got the rhymes, bitch, I'll kick that shit)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a4f759aba2e16ec0dc9f29d1577cfede.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
