Bro, man, I heard a couple of tracks on the mixtape, man. Sounds phenomenal, dude. Uhh, keep it up, aight? Be safe! Keep making them hits, baby!\n\n\n[Verse]\nI blow your mind like cocaine, nah\nI blow your mind like Cobain, rest in peace\nSucker emcees deceased\nRise on the East I'm the sun bringing heat for sure\nI've been making tracks on the low\nWaiting for my time to shine and then blow like Johnny, Depp\nIncrease the rep\nLike a bench press set homie yes I get repped\nPaid my dues but I'm still in debt\n'Cause I have no credibility in the game yet\nGotta apply, and run a background check\nBut I bounce\n'Cause I ain't done shit yet\nRight now, that's what I'm trying to do\nStay spitting rhymes whenever I roll through\nCall me the Grinch, homie I don't give a hoo\nAny emcee, yes I gotta kill you\nBut don't take it personal it's business fool\nDo like Travolta just be cool\nAnd nowadays everybody sound the same\nThe Price is Right, but I don't play that game\nWon't never stop 'till they all know my name\nGotta grind to the top rid Rodriguez with the fame\nHomie if I kill you accept that you're gone\nThis ain't Call of Duty you can't respawn\nHad your girl down talking on jive\n'Til I hit you with the MP5\nSuppression, I really hope y'all learned your lesson\nAnd never forget that I'm the unsung freshman\n\n[Voicemails]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/646d03f37cdf5b66ef95c6ca341ba5fb.588x588x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
