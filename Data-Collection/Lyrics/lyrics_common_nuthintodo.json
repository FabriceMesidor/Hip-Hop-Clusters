I'm the comma comma chameleon\nI use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags\nThat was when bitches had Gucci bags\nAnd wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas\nHoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures\n8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come\nFights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one\nWe'd come to the get-together with whoever\nYou wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together\nEat up all your vittles, drink your brew\nAnd then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all\nThat was when mad was tall and phat was cold\nThe days of Old Chicago and Fun Town\nAs shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down\nBut the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down\nWe'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear\nHave enough for a Polish and car fare\nI stare, at what use to be better\nAnd think about who use to cop our liquor\n(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got more rhymes than The Manor got folks\nHad style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats\nAnd penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines\nWe use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme\nIt's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop\nSkeeter would hit from the same spot\n'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down\nPut your body in motion only the strong survive\nBut on the 6 or the 5\nLive is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet\nBall Club with music by, Andre Hatchett\nOr either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties\nWe'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell \"Aight, now money!\"\nSauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare\nI liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there\nWhitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks\nBut mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with\nThe best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions\nCut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that)\nOver Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work\nBust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster\nTook the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster\nThen HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap\nYou was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say \"Up your hat.\"\nWhat you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit\nEither fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full\nMy drink then was Boone's and Red Bull\nI remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool\nI thought I was cool, with my \"Members Only\" and a bald fade\nWalk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade\nAnd soft brush, as we got older we would stalk, rush, and bang fags\nGo to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas\nIn games of Off the Wall, and softball, \"Piggy one\" I would call\nWhen I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie\nHome of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy\n\n[Chorus: Common & (ODB sample)]\nI'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but uh\n(Niggas be rollin)\nAin't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I\n(Niggas be rollin)\nGotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um\n(Niggas be rollin)\nWe gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause umm\n(Niggas be rollin)\n\n[Scratched]\n(\"I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago\")\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8cc4e9a4a27cf48a434a2d5800999430.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
