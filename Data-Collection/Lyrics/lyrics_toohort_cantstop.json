can't retire\nFrom nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight\nI Don't Stop Rappin' like my first tapes\nWhen I was broke, I used to sell \u00e2\u20ac~em instantly\nOne look, you could tell it was the pimp in me\nIn eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E\nA bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me\nEvery night, sold out, turnin' young hoes\nTell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth\nI smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes\nAlways fucked up in niggas bitches all the time\nNow I'm ridin' on twenties wearin' nice clothes\nBut ain't nuttin' like pimpin' hoes and ridin' Vogues\nI live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness\nI'm so glad, to get to the point of havin' this\nOpportunity, for you and me to pass it on\nTwo years ago, I thought it'd be my last song\nMe, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street\nSmokin' white boys, bumpin' dope fiend beats\nEighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin' it\nNiggas like Lil' Tim was out there ballin' sellin' cakes n shit\nI was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin' raps\nAll about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball and G on the map\nNowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches\nKickin' it with rich niggas in rollers and candy sixes\nDeliverin' hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs\nNiggas who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs\nFeel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main\nShort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin' to leave this game\nState to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make\nWriting raps, makin' more than them niggas movin' weight\nThe game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you\nThanks for passin' game, now let's get out here and make this loot\nI won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'\nI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'\nWe some presidential players, with money by the layers\nAin't nuthin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us\nI won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'\nI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'\nI drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes\nAnd meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes\nI had to sacrifice, get things right\nIn this rap life, I paid my dues\nLearn how to crawl, before I walk\nThen I learned how to tie my shoes\nTryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me\nMatter of fact it did it worse for me\nGetting' eyes scarred, bein' weak one time ya hard\nIt can only do hurt to me\nSo I sucked up my peer pressure and my pride\nAnd realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive\nStay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool\nHell this music thing is all I got\nI ain't makin' straight A's in school\nAnd ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different\nSo all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't\nWhen you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing\n\u00c2\u20ac~Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons\nMy first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady\nMJG, what you see, on TV, is fame\nBut the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game\nI won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'\nI make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'\nI live the fast life of a MC\nAnd I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats\nI could do a show tonight and make ten G's\nFuck \u00e2\u20ac~til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed\nThree cars in my garage, truck in the driveway\nI always, get my dick sucked on the highway\nMy way pimp \u00e2\u20ac~til I die, fuck a hoe\nUnless that hoe is breakin' me off some dough\nTo hit the studio blowin', niggas ain't knowin'\nHow far this shit is goin'?\nI wrote all my shit but niggas\nAlways talkin' \u00e2\u20ac~bout what I owe them\nBut I'm gon' show them, real niggas\nStand on they own ten toes\nSo I'ma make all the money\nAnd try my best to fuck all these hoes\nFriend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'\nEightball got flow, MJG\nHere comes the one they call the P I M P\nNever will retire\nThe tree-high, green leaf\nHelps me to get higher\nEightball and MJG, Too Short\nWe all must be\nThe pimps of the industry\nShit people pretend to be\nFuck so why should we, settle down\nLeave the kitchen put the kettles down\nStop from fillin' all you hoes\nGive up the life of trues and vogues\nHell no, it ain't gon' happen\nThis shit too deep\nSo I hooked up with my comrades\nSo we can all get rich, nigga\nI won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'\nI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'\nWe some presidential players, with money by the layers\nAin't nuthin' you broke ass niggas do that can fade us\nI won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'\nI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'\nI drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes\nAnd meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes\nYeah, yeah, one time, for your motherfuckin' mind\nPimp shit bitch\nEightball and MJG, now what you weigh me\nShort Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes\nNuthin' but the real shit, nine-eight\nFor these tricks it's too late\nIt's that old school pimpin'\nAll the way from Memphis, to Oakland\nStraight smokin' baby, fryin' \u00e2\u20ac~em up fat\nAtlanta to Houston, we still doin' it like this\nYeah, New York to L.A\nBeyitch\nHah, that's right, Space Age forever, nigga\nT-Mix on the funk\nDangerous Music, uhh\nSuave House\nI love that", "image":
