Well his name Pookie (gyah) and you owe like him\nAt the trailers, thought we began trust\nYou stand up my hand is on your damn butt you say I'm nuts!\nThe way I ham up, you said you understand us\nAnd lessons that I can't cut but in the end you jammed up!\nI don't take nothin' (gyah) but I expected something!
