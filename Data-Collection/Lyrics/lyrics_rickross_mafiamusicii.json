Cheese\nI bust my nut and holla lucky me\nIts tatted in my vein I remain sucker free\nMy vocal like an atom bomb in the Avalon\nBlack roses for singing the saddest song\nAs Salamu Alaykum to paper\nWalaikum Salam\nIm the don inshallah, now pour me my Dom\nBeing gangstas a cold job\nWack a nigga go rejoice with a blow job\nAlways wanted Rolls Royce with no job\nThen again all I fear is a dope charge\nAll I fear is a dope charge\nTell me whats the odds for appeals for a dope boy\nWho shed tears for a dope boy\nOh what happens to the kids of the dope boy\nOrphans, fucking orphans\nBorn defending some nigga never been on offence\nNow its shrimp, order more shrimp\nMy neighbourhood a rackett I practice my importance\nYou know we hustle to the key of life\nMoving weed and white before we learn to read and write\nSo fuck a tutor pay attention to my shooter\nFucking me today but next she be fucking Luda\nWe assholes with fast cars and cash flow\nMy last load was gift wrapped by Castro\nI did it all but the blow was my specialty\nMental telepathy directly in my recipe\nAhh, 2 mill on my second home\nStill stepping on a couple bricks of that methadone\nI got a method for getting money like RZA do\nResurrected Big Poppa in the physical\nReincarnated the realest I'm getting revenue\n10 mill borrowed from my peers in the federal\nAnd thats several for slinging in Atlanta\nBut the way they dress you never knew\nThought they seen a better view\nBut the feds had a rat named Reginald\nThat put em on a pedestal the conviction was incredible\nThe moral of the story was\nAin't no happy ending for a thug\nI think of 2Pac, I think of Biggie now\nLook how they getting down, I went and bought a 50 Cal\nWe all go when we gotta go\nMy Glock hole bigger than Nicki Minaj camel toe\nSo let the panel know we back, the commission intact\nTeflon Don in all black fulfilling contracts\nI'm only here to supersede my successors\nRIP Paul Castellano, Myer Lansky, Bumpy Johnson, Al Capone\nT-Roger, Tookie Williams, Carlo Gambino and last but not least John Gotti\nTeflon Don\n(Ross, Ross, ross)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/98acc041b4386f147a4d2bbacb78bd1d.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
