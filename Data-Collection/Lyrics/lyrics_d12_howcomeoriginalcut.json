This bullshit can't be true\nWe family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!\n\n[Verse 1 - Eminem]\nWe were so young so full of life and vibrance\nSide by side, wherever you was riding, I went\nSo close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit\nWhen Ronnie died you was right by my side\nWith a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes\nAnd a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it\nYou even had the same type of childhood I did\nSometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours\nAnd mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it\nWe grew up, grew apart as time went by us\nAnd I blew up to both yours and mines surprises\nNow I feel a vibe I just can't describe it\nMuch as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice\nAnd your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it\n\n[Hook - Eminem]\n\n[Verse 2 - Kon Artis]\nIt was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse\nOn my own album with a deal but shit got worse\n'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first\nFor I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome\nBitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit\nBut you were playing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit\nI told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her\nComing outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk\nLike y'all was husband and wife or something\nBut me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something\nCause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me\nWhen all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty\nAnd ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced\nYou acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose\nBut I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth\nDon't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you\n\n[Hook - Eminem]\n\n[Verse 3 - Proof]\nIts gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop\nNow we acting like I gotta live only for the block\nAnd homies in the hood only see me on the tube\nSo they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude\nFools I used to rap wit all expect magic\nLike my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen\nBut proof is just acting out the part he was thrown\nShady made it so my babies ain't starving at home\nSee the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends\nForever real intelligence that's forever till the end\nI peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies\nAin't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise\n(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?\n(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?\nAnd every time I go to hear you play, you look away\nWe barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face\n\n[Eminem]\nHow come?\n\n[Verse 4 - Bizarre]\nWhen we started dating I was almost 9\nNow I'm 35 missing that big behind\nAnd all I do is drive think about our lives\nCome home every night dodging butcher knives\nAnd I ain't gon' lie I like the attention\nSleeping with other wives saying I'm out fishing\nLet's put it all behind let's settle our difference\nYou ready to talk I'm ready to listen\n\n[Verse 5 - Swifty McVay]\nBack in the days I was feening for fame\nIt's a shame rappers just like coochie you kick game until you bang\nAnd every waking morning I'm doing the same thing\nJust hanging and brainstorming just trying to make a name\nWhen you blessing the game\nThat's when everyone around you whole persception will change\nAnd you accept it cuz you made it\nBut when your funds faded your treated like a scoundrel\nObviously your homies never gave a shit about you\nI pain my dues twice and I ain't lying\nSee that's first in the hood and the other after I signed\nNo time for being kind when your enemies shown\nI walk alone while y'all trying anything to get on\n\n[Hook - Eminem]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d38fa240d684e57a565427318ace6fee.706x706x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
