Dot]\nI sit on the studio couch\nAsk myself what the fuck am I thinking about\nThinking 'bout living without the past and the present\nA Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off 600 seconds\n10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore\nK. Dot had turned Curious George\nYou know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for\nLike what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads\nBefore he turned right to get them shots through the door\nThey say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic\nSo he'd risk his own life, to get someone else killed\nBut in the process, get injured, it don't make sense\nIt's like the Da Vinci Code, trying the solve the crime of these rap souls\nWhat if B.I.G. never did it big\nNever went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes\nWould it make my flow flow more persistent\nWould it raise up the bar of competition, who knows\nWho told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV\nWould the battle be less interesting, if it wasn't personal\nIf Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening\nPeople thinking its a publicity stunt\nWhat if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow\nHip-hop would really be fucked\nSomething like Milli Vanilli\nNothing different, quite similar\nFilling up my mind capacity\nThinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony\nWhat if the shooter-\nBetter yet, what if Malcolm on the side\nKilled two birds with one stone, both would've died\nNow lets rewind\n\n[Hook-D'Angelo]\nBefore we go\nCan you imagine?\nPicture years, with your mom\nCan you imagine?\nHang her picture in the sky\nCan you imagine?\nCall emergency I've been dreamin' all my life\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Rock]\nImagine if Tookie was a Blood, Look, no disrespect\nBut would there be more Bloods than Crips sets\nDominating the population of-\nL.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay\nMatter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit\nY'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit\nNo drive bys, no flags stickin' out pockets\nNo NWA dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru\nImagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two\nFeet no paralyzed, would he be alive\nOr would he been lost his life to the streets\nNo match, no cars in that driveway\nWhat if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin\nOn this L.A. strip, would these rap n*ggas use his name\nNah, what if rap niggas never had rap would they try to fall back on this drug game\nThese rappers ass backwards\nNow these rappers getting caught with the cocaine\nNot to smoke, but to slang\nImagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane\nJust think about it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Punch]\nImagine life without death would you even feel alive\nYour people that passed, what if they never died\nImagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness\nKnowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness\nThe street living what if the crack epidemic\nNever reached the projects and destroyed our buildings\nTurned most of us to killers, innocent victims\nImagine if heroine didn't affect our system\nThey say drug money funding the labels today\nWhat about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A\nImagine if they really tried to fix these streets\nWould they start in the hood, or executive suites\nWhere the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me\nYou could possibly live without heat\nImagine if Al Gore, had won that election\nWould the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected\nImagine the penal system without witness protection\nWould there be these many cowards on the stand telling\nI don't know, I'm just speaking my mind\nLost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine\n\n(Training day, training day)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0d736130ef89ba0b866b3b01fad325c1.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
