Life deal a nigga blows\nBut we eat that shit\nThis one here's for my brother, we gon beat that shit now\nI say my prayers, I got too many people in my head right now\nSo many that's in jail or they're dead right now\nOne time for my nigga Craig right now\nHe in the feds - damn, the times change\nAnd these stupid niggas talking about \"crime pays\"\nYou can keep that shit: I just made a million\nCall me when you reached that shit\nAin't bragging, I'm just shedding some light\nOne time for my granny up in heaven tonight\nAnd the young boy from a show down in Hampton\nTold me that my song was the reason he beat cancer\nAin't know what to say, I just froze\nLittle too deep, I suppose..\nBut after a year of review, I figured out it wasn't me, it was you nigga\nCongratulations..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8efb9bd50fec5579f877e3556648527d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
