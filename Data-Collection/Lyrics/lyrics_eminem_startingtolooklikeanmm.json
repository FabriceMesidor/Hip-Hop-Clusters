The G-Unit captain insisted that fans are going to be seeing a slim-and-trim Eminem real soon.\n\n\u201cEm is in shape right now. He looks good. I seen him in Detroit. He\u2019s gonna look real good when you see him return,\u201d Fif laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s in shape right now.\u201d\n\nThe rapper has been on hiatus ever since releasing his official Shady Records mixtape, Eminem Presents the Re-Up, in December of 2006. In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinez\u2019s show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was \u201cin limbo\u201d and \u201cdebating\u201d whether to release another album . Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.\n\nThose rumors \u2014 coupled with a National Enquirer story that quoted an \u201cinsider\u201d as saying that the rapper \u201c[has] got a double chin, a potbelly and droopy man-breasts.

But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Em\u2019s fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).\n\n\u201cThe last time I seen him we played basketball together,\u201d 50 said. \u201cHe had a knee injury, so we chilled for a little bit.\u201d", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
