rain in Compton like it's a strip club\nI grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was\nMy mama house was in the middle of the street\nHow was a nigga supposed to get to school?\nI hopped every backyard on my block\nTill I got to  Elm Street, took the rag out my sock\nAnd I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much\nAll Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much\nI was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm\nWith the ratchet in my Bulls jacket, giving you the facts on Elm\nKing Frog and Big Face had my back on Elm\nWe was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm\nI had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes\nAir Max 95s, not a scratch on my Nikes\n2016 motherfucker, don't you pull it\n'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets\n\n[Chorus: The Game & will.i.am]\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh\nDon't trip on me, don't trip on me\nDon't trip on me, don't trip on me\nDon't trip on me, don't trip on me\nNigga don't trip\n\n[Verse 6: The Game]\n'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that\nI'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that\nThey say \"Game, why you always act a fool like that?\"\n'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that\nI was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that\nThey was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that\nThem niggas jumped me, why they have to do a 'Ru like that?\nNigga went and got the homies and we flew right back\nThey C like that, we B like that\nWe trip like that cause LA sick like that\nWe Blood like that, we Crip like that\nThe blunt lit like that, we out\n\n[Outro: will.i.am]\nWhen you ready, lemme know\nWhen you want it, lemme know, I got it\nWhen you see me, congratulate a nigga, don't hate\nNiggas will always be niggas, yep, true\nThat's why I don't trip on these niggas, would you?\nNiggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep\nWhat happens when niggas unite and start making them moves\nDon't trip", "image":
