Bring the champagne glasses, roll the J's faster\n\n[Chorus]\nTime flies, no lie (no lie)\nI'd rather be getting high (high)\nRidin' with my niggas getting right (right)\nIt ain't over 'till I say so (say so)\nTime flies, no lie (no lie)\nI'd rather be getting high (high)\nRidin' with my niggas getting right (right)\nIt ain't over 'till I say so (say so)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8cdf794701e7eb0a36622e5c13d091b3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
