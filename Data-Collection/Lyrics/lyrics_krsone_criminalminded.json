See I am a musician\n\nRappin' on the mic like this to me is fine\n'Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine\nYou can see that Scott LaRock and I are mentally binded\nIn other words we're both criminal minded\n\nWe're not promoting violence, we're just havin' some fun\nHe's Scott LaRock, I'm KRS-One\nNever off-beat 'cause it don't make sense\nGrab the microphone, relaxed and not tense\n\nYou waited, debated and now you activated\nA musical genius that could not be duplicated\nSee I have the formula for rockin' the house\nIf you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth\n\nIt's that simple, no phony cosmetics to your pimple\nTake another look because the gear is not wrinkled\nThe K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E\nSayin' rhyme for eighty-seven not from 1983\n\nWell versed, to rehearse and my rhymes are my curse\nOriginality come first but the suckers get worse\nAllow me to include I have a very stable mood\nPoetic education of a high altitude\n\nI'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician\nA genius when it comes to makin' music with ambition\nI'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed\nDon't wanna be elected as the king of a record\n\nJust respected by others as the man with the solution\nAn artist of the 80's came and left his contribution\nOn wax, relax, there's 24 tracks\nAfter years of rockin' parties now I picked up the knack\n\nBecause everythin' that flows from out my larynx\nTakes years of experience and bottles of Beck's\nI cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex\nIs it real or is it Memorex?\n\nI'm livin' in a city known as New York State\nSucka MC's gotta wait while I translate\nI hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads\nPeople with ambition and straight up musicians\n\nAlthough our lives have been so uprooted\nI have it included, you all get zooted\nSo take each letter of the KRS-One\nMeans knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone\n\nYou look at me and laugh, but this is your class\nIt's an all-out discussion of the suckas I be crushin'\nSo now you are awakened to the music I be makin'\nNever duplicated, and also highly cultivated\n\nDon't get frustrated 'cause nothin' has been traded\nOnly activated, it came out very complicated\nNot separated, from my DJ, you see my voice is now faded\nI'll see you folks around the way, criminal minded\nCriminal minded, criminal minded, criminal minded", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e9fa55af2e8bfddf3b40ea0e0347874f.556x556x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
