I'm a give 'em a heat stroke\nSummertime, wearin' a peacoat\nI be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus\nNow trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage\nFabulous wordplay\nAnd you can get served every day without a in-house maid\nBe very afraid, I'm nasty with it\nBorn out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses\nThis harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets\nPuttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man\nHennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?\nEyes red like a twelve o'clock fight", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e4e53b7f03232ca6164f65a599807578.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
