I like that shit\n\n[Chorus:]\nGirl I like it when you do it like that\nI like the way you shake and you bounce that back\nI like the way it looks 'cause your booty so fat\nI'd like to take you home girl and move in that crack\nI like it when them cheeks jump up and down\nI like it when you drop and make it touch the ground\nYou lookin' in my eyes and I'm lookin' right back\nJust don't stop dancin 'cause I like it like that", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf235bef3026a6f3ce0ab508ff5f91d3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
