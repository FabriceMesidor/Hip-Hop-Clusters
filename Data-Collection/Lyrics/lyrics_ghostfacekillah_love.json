Fox)]\nLove, lift us up, (higher) take us higher (high)\nBlossom every ghetto flower (oh Love yeah)\nCos Love, only Love has the heat and the power\nAnd we can never live without\nLove, Love, Love\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nLove life, the ground we walk on\nMy sickness, it made me strong\nMy loved ones in Heaven\nThe ones we lost, to heroin\nMalcolm, Martin, and what they stood for, them men had it poppin'\nLove the sun when rain drops in, cozy nights with my pumpkin\nLove my hell and my struggle\nYou gotta go through Hell to come out right, Love conquers pain and the puzzle\nFunny on how Love could end so subtle\nWas it just sex and not really Love for the couple?\nLove people, Love the fact when there's a baby bein' born\nLike \"push girl, come on\"\nI'm not just sayin' that cause BET's on\nWe is one, one Love, each one, teach one\n\n[Hook to fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1563d407e670f05603a84947a6af2c41.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
