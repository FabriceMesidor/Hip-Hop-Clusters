I'm tired of life\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins\nI'm tired of committin' so many sins\nTired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins\nTired of never havin' any ends\nTired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins\nI'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins\nTired of not havin' a deal\nTired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel\nTired of drownin' in my sorrow\nTired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo\nI'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off\nI'm tired of jobs startin' off\nAt $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off\nI'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough\nTired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk\nFor this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk\nI'm tired of usin' plastic silverware\nTired of workin' at Builder's Square\nTired of not bein' a millionaire\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if I had a million dollars\nI'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics\nIf I had a magic wand\nI'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on\nWhile I'm on the john\nIf I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough\nBecause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks\nIf I had one wish, I would ask\nFor a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor\nTired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store\nI'm tired of not havin' a phone\nTired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on\nTired of not drivin' a BM\nTired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him\nTired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM\nTired of not performin' in a packed coliseum\nTired of not bein' on tour\nTired of fuckin' the same blonde whore\nAfter work, in the back of a Contour\nI'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones\nHavin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns\nTired of bein' stared at\nTired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat\nTired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz\nTired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs\nTired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me\nSayin' they wasn't feelin' me on \"Nobody's As Ill As Me\"\nAnd I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs\nTired of JLB sayin', \"Where hip-hop lives\"\n\n[Chorus]\nBut if I had a million dollars\nI'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics\nIf I had a magic wand\nI'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on\nWhile I'm on the john\nIf I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough\nBecause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks\nIf I had one wish, I would ask\nFor a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss\n\n[Outro]\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm tired of all of this bullshit, tellin' me to be positive\nHow am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI rap about shit around me, shit I see\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nRight now, I'm tired of everything\nTired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city\nCan't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?\nBut hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm just fed up, that's my word", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18fd7ff1ba2db7ae16a26498fc58bb64.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
