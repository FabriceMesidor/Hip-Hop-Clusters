O. B.O. Bitch\nAll you hater, I don't even wanna hear no\nI don't even know why I got smoked for...\nBut still man, you know how I do it\nGrand hustle in the building, yo\n... It's a problem, yo, feel it...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3252379f345638f5b880f5055e0ca791.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
