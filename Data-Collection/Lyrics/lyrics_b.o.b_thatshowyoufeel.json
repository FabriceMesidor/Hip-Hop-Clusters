But it ain't no mystery, ain't it?\nI work 24/7, nonstop, I think I deserve to be medicinally faded\nI think I deserve to get wasted, I think I deserve a vacation\nI spent a couple grips on this whip\nShit, I think I deserve to repaint it, fuck it\n\n[Hook]\nI don't waste time wit' you fake kind\nHustle all day 'til it's playtime\nMotherfucker, I'm a take mine, I'm a take mine\nCause ain't shit free, I'm a make mine\n'Member I'm a take mine, I'm a take mine\nI'm a take mine for sure, motherfucker, I'm a take mine\nI'm a take mine,  I'm a take mine cause ain't shit free\nSo I'm a make mine\n\n[Bridge]\nThat's how you feel, that's how you feel\nThat's how you feel, that's how you feel\nThat's how you feel, that's how you feel\nThat's how you feel, that's how you feel\n\nHook\n\n[Verse 2]\nI find it funny you say you changed the game\nBut without the South, you wouldn't even have a lane\nYou'd still be average name, it don't take half a brain\nBut, see, i just stunt cause I want to\nI don't even have to have a chain\nI don't even have to have a (-)\nI just throw these ones cause I want to\nNiggas get mad at me\nCause this lifestyle I live is out of they budget\nWell, I guess it's why they be grudgin'\nI just grab my glasses, say, 'Fuck it'\nThen I light that gas, tear that big old gal\nThen put that ass in my bucket, I'm dippin'\nAnd I tell 'em where I'm goin'\nBut wherever B.o.B at, it's some bad bitches for 'em\nIt's really just the norm\nI don't even see the haters, I just learn to ignore 'em\nFuck a hip-hop forum, if I ain't on your list, I take no offense\nKillin' every lane, y'all strugglin' to fit\nI don't ever look back, I've been killin' ever since, that's clear", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/3000aa5b569ca66b123116f0716b1aa3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
