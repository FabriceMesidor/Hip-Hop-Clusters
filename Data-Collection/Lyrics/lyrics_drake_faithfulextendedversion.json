like to play games cause they feel like they know me (they know me)\nYou don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)\nSo don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (game)\nThis

all mine the way I took it\nYou would think it broke down the way I push it\nYou hate it when I coat things all in sugar\nYou want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nWorking, working, working, working, ain't ya?\nYou don't have no time to lay up\nYou just trying to be somebody\n'Fore you say you need somebody\nGet all your affairs in order\nI won't have

pass\nI want to turn you out like pitch black\nWant to watch you do work while I sit back\nCause you talk like you got what I need\nYou talk like you got the juice and the squeeze\nTalk like you bet

to get better with time\nWon't you, outsmart me\nTold me that your brain works better than mine\nTell me I should know you\nI got to know you again\nYou want me to show you\nI'm gonna show you again\nNow we're in the zone\nGon' let me all in again\nAnd now you're coming over\nOver and over and over and over and over again\nOver and over again\nOver and over again\nNow you're coming over\nOver and over again\nOver and over again\nYou tell me I should know you\nBut I'll get to know you again\nAnd you want me to show you\nI'm gonna show you again\nWhen were in the zone you\nGon' let me own it again\nAnd now you're coming over\nOver and over and over and over and over again\nNow you're coming over\nYou're coming over\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 4: dvsn]\nI wet all the floors of your ego\nFeel like I was slipping away\nAnd you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere\nCause some of these things never change, no, no\nI know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true\nThere's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you\nBut we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110\nShow me what I gotta do\n\n[Hook: Drake & dvsn]\nI know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?\nYou don't have no time to lay up\nYou just trying to be somebody\n'Fore you say you need somebody\nGet all your affairs in order\nI won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl\nFaithful, faithful, faithful, faithful\n\n[Bridge: dvsn]\nAnd before you leave here (I need you to cum)\nAnd until you do babe (don't you leave)\nAin't about me no more (need you to know)\nTonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)\nAnd before you leave here (I need you to cum)\nBut before you do (don't you leave)\nIt ain't about me no more (need you to know)\nMake that sure you (cum before me)\n\nPart 2: Make Sure\n\n[Verse 5: dvsn]\nGet you on top of me\nWe can do this still properly\nGet your hands in the air, do your hair back\nYou're like a winning ticket off the lottery\nBut you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me\nYeah, you don't want to start with me\nBut you should, keep shaking that in front of me\nUnless you're down to do this publicly\nYou know, you know you gon' get comfortable\nOn the [?] rug with me\nAnd I fuck with you\nSo if you really fuck with me\nGet as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you\nAnd she hit me with that \"I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions\"\nLet's see what's next then\nAnd it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)\nGirl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)\nYou know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)\nMake sure, make sure  (cum before me)\nMake sure, make sure (I need you to cum)\nMake sure, make sure (told you to leave)\nYou know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)\nMake sure, make sure  (cum before me)", "image":
