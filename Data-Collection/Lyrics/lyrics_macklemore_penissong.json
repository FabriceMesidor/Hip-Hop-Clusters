I feel bad for, like, you know the guys with like, you know, their left one hangs like lower than the right one, kinda like a\u2014kinda like a lazy eye, like on your, on your balls. I don\u2014I don't know, I just just heard that... I feel bad\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThis is my penis song\nI wish that I had a bigger shlong\nOne that was quite a bit more thick and way more long\nFellas, if y'all feel me sing along (Don't front, don't front)\n\n[Interlude 2]\n[?] Ayo ladies? Yeah? Ladies? Yeah? Do you want a guy with an average dick? Hell no. Then\u2014wait, you don't? No, honkey dick. Okay, that's cool (Whatever) No, that's fine\n\n[Verse 2]\nI promise, I'm so self conscious\nThat's why you never see me skinny dippin' in August\nAlways walkin' around with my hands in my pockets\nTryna pump blood into my guy Alfonso\nI mean, goddamn I don't think you girls understand\nI've had a complex since that song Short Short Man\nAnd even though girls have told me that I'm big\nWhen I watch a porno I feel like a little kid\nI mean, let's take Ron Jeremy\nNow if a girl sees him she'll compare him to me\nAnd every MC in hip-hop has got a huge cock\nOr at least talks about it in every song that they drop\nI mean, shit\nIf I was really hung I'd make a whole album called Me and My Dick\nWith interludes of all the girls that I'd been with\nAnd talk about my package and multiple orgasms\n'Cause all that I see is that size does matter\nWe got Enzite, penis pumps, surgery to Viagra\nBut when it all adds up you can't really change it\nI'm not a porno star, I just gotta face it\n\n[Interlude 3]\nYou know, I mean, what can I do? Nothing, right? This song goes out to, like, all the, like, little bit above average dudes, to, like, the small dudes, medium dudes but all you big guys, man, stop [?]\n\n[Chorus 2]\nThis is my penis song\nI wish that I had a bigger shlong\nOne that was quite a bit more thick and way more long\nFellas, if y'all feel me sing along (Don't front, don't front)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
