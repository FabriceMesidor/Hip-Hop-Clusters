It always rains on me\nWhen I first came home, I was in the feds, they took my kids, homie\nLiving in a lie homie, man, the devils alive, will I ever survive? I never die, homie\nNever knew in my life that I would step into fire\n\n[Chorus]\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid it all for a little, did it all for my niggas\nShine hard for the bitches, put a mask on for the pictures\nDifferent know from my homies, talk like you don\u2019t know me\nDamn its gonna cost tomorrow, all them drunk flicks you wanna show me\nFunny how we back here, all my fam here\nTwisting up while we rolling up with a wine glass on a glass pier\nWent from sleeping at Tony home, moving back to where I was grown\nTrippy how\nA nigga lifestyle makes me live my life wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nStep in to my time machine\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa\nWhooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
