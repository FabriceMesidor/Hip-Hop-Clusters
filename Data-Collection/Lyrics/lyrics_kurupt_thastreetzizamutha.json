Well, you must have heard of us\nThe gangsta gang, full of jack artists and murderers\n\n[Verse 2: Daz]\nAutomatics rang out, you left dead nigga wit yo brains out\nWalk back to the porch, wit some salt to wash the stains out\nMurders my hobby, kidnapping, jacking, and robbery\nWild as a safari, in a paid-for Ferrari\nPay the cops off as I peel out and jet\nIt ain't no thing when we connect, we posted up with Tecs\nNigga we bury you alive in cement, that's what we meant\nNow when the nine goes click, yo ass wasn't shit\nGet out your war tactics, get at you get the job done\nOne gun you hung, seven bullets in your lungs\nStruggle with heron and I'll tear you apart\nThrough my veins and through my heart\nThat's when the drama will start\nNigga gimme what you got, let off some more shots\nRun through what you got, destroy yo block\nGotti, Dillinger forever runs your spot\nWhen the nine goes pop, that's when your homeboys drop\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Kurupt]\nI seen it befo', .44's explode\nNiggas fall on the flo', the hardest nigga on the flo'\nThe hoes late, do what the fuck ever a nigga say\nIt's like this every day on the streets of L.A\nGotta a lumberjack, the size of a tank\nI'm a hammerhead with a hammer the size of a tank\nEver heard of a gangsta?
