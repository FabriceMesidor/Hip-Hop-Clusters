Rose\nNever see me at a show in cheap clothes\nTake over the game no cheat code\nAnd I'mma ball like Shaq, no free throws, I'm on...\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWhen it be coming to this rap shit I'm top shotta\nMidwest godfather, hotter than the city like Bambaataa\nAnd I'm a damn problem, a speedknot mobsta\nBlowing on the top ganja\nEverything I wear cost top dollar\n\n[Hook]\nIf you're on what I'm on come fuck with me\nIf you're 'bout getting money come fuck with me\nIf you blowing on loud come fuck with me\nIf you need a new style come fuck with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI am the Higgs boson\nMass of the rap, lance rigs with photons\nCome on write that over more gigs and role bombs\nMake you have to hold your kids in your arms\nGot you the remedy\nWe stand the test of time like I'm the statue of liberty\nAnd I'm bringing the wrath on my enemy and I'm an immortal\nWhen I'm in a portal full of math and chemistry\nTelling you that I'mma get 'em when I see you coming with the rhetoric that let me know you wanna get annihilated\nI am at the pinnacle of what I wanna be, then leave an enemy in back of me and anybody violated\nPut 'em at the bottom of the barrel I'm a animal\nI kill 'em with the ammunition, there gon' be no murdering me\nComing to the surface of the Earth and the purpose of work is the worth of a person per hundred million money for me\nProtons, neutrons, electrons\nBuilding blocks to a decepticon\nYou just met with tron, the upset LeBron\nKobe Wan Kenobi\nLeft hand and I'm a black Gin\u00f3bili\nShootin' 'em until they marry death in holy matrimony\nShit on muthafuckas if I ever catch 'em acting phony\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nWhen it be coming to this rap shit im top shotta\nMid-west god father, hotter in the city like bambaataa\nAnd I'm a damn problem, a speedknot mobstaz\nBlowing on the top ganja\nEverything I wear cost top Dollar\n\n[Hook]\nIf you're on what I'm on come fuck with me\nIf you're 'bout getting money come fuck with me\nIf you blowing on loud come fuck with me\nIf you need a new style come fuck with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22947d4f60e8349895bb1529f74a6530.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
