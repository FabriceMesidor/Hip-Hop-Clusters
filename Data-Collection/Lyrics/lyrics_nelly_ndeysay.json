And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold up, stop ma, let me get a look at'cha\nDamn girl, I ain't seen you since prom\nCome to think about it, can't believe it's been that long\nI heard your man locked down now, how long he gone?\nOh that long? How the hell'd he get time like that\nThree strikes with possession - aw he ain't coming back\nHe left you with two kids and bills all around\nPlus you found out he had another chick 'cross town\nIt's always the darkest, ah-right before the sun rising\nAnd you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and\nAnd please don't despise, and go against all brothers\nAnd have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another\nI hate to sound 2Pac-ish lil' mama, but keep ya head up\nBut you gon' make it, I promise - you keep your head up\nAnd that that don't kill you only makes you stronger\nAnd the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real\nF'real, f'real, hey\n\n[Chorus]\n(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was at the gas station when a man walked past\nWith a sign \"will work for food, clothes or cash\"\nAnd he asked if he could pump my gas - so I let him\nClean the windshield and throw out the trash - so I let him\nHey, I even asked the brother his name\nWhere he was from, got kids man and what's they age\nHe kinda sturred for a second, he kinda looked surprise\nThat anyone would even take an interest in his life\nHe said, \"Young brother dem the only wurrds, I done hurrd, in the last yurr\nThat wasn't low or get the fuck away from hurr\"\nHow could something so simple as general conversation\nMean much more than general conversation? Hey\nYou could tell life had beaten him down\nLike he was in a title fight and this might be his last round\nSometimes the easiest things we take for granted\nUntil they gone, to realize we even had it, f'real\nF'real, f'real, hey\n\n[Chorus]\n(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI used to think that life had a plan for me\nUntil I realized, life had to be planned by me\nSee that's the key, I only deal with what I can see\n'Cause over history, mystery brought us nutting but misery\nMan mo' people done died, in the name of the Lord\nThan in any natural disaster, disease or gang war\nBefore guns there was swords, and they was killing each other\nAin't much changed since the days, we still killing each other\nKilling our brothers while another mother cries for help\nMan, we need to help a brother find himself\nFeed him, life, ah-one-twoooo, three\nHey, that's something e'ry brother should see, and that's f'real\nAnd that's f'real, and that's f'real, hey\n\n[Chorus]\n(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh\nOhhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh\nOahhh-ohhhh\n\n[Outro]\n(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8725bb6958dbc6076ad2498e0b6aaf81.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
