Nothin' they can say now\nNothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now\nWhat more can I say now? What more can I say now?\nYou might feel like nothin' was the same\n\n[Chorus]\nI still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low\nFuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low\nI still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low\nThe furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know\nI just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low\nFuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low\nI just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low\nThe furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I hate that you don't think I belong to ya\nJust too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya\nYou know that paper my passion\nBittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened\nI can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish\nI made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's\nAnd now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it\nGirl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked\nGirl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender\nGettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together\nYou know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition\nBut you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same\n\n[Chorus]\nI still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low\nFuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low\nI still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low\nThe furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know\nI just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low\nFuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low\nI just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low\nThe furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Bridge]\nDrinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'\nSchemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money\nDrinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'\nSchemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, this the life for me\nMy momma told me this was right for me\nI got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me\nI should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me\nYour actions make us doubt you\nYour lack of effort got me rappin' different\nThis the shit I wanna go out to\nPlay this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'\nNaked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'\nDonate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'\nA nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?\nI had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up\nYours truly, the boy\nI just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy\nY'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record\nNo filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before\n\n[Outro]\nYes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to\nYeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84ad5364b68fe10c7405ba894802736d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
