I had it before\nBut I'm like Cameo, I go \"Back and Forth\"\n... Like Big Pun and Joe\nSometimes \"I don't wanna be a player no more\"\nAnd when the time comes around, you know what's next\nThrow away my phone and my rolodex\nIt's gone, and I didn't even notice it\nMy player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch\n\n[Chorus]\n[Too $hort]\nYour player card got revoked\nAnd it cain't be renewed - no it's not a joke\nOnce you give it up, it's hard to get it back\nCause fallin in love is like hittin crack\nOne hit and you a junkie\nAll day and night you'll be lickin that monkey\nYou love the way it's sticky and funky\nYou said I don't wanna live, if she don't want me\nI never had days like that\nCause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks\nI gotta get that scratch\nI get it from a batch, or from my rats\nIt's gon' happen, cause the game is here\nAsk Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player\nYou know when love'll happen for me?\nWhen I start buyin hookers, and rappin for free\nNever~!\n\n[Chorus]\n[Outro]\nIt ain't expired yet baby\nI'm thinkin 'bout renewin it\nShort Dawg in the house, PFL\nPlayer For Life\nPlayer For Life baby\nSometimes I feel like I don't wanna be a player\nBut I am...\n\nSmoke one wit'cha potnah mayne\nYou in the mix with Too $hort, \"Still Blowin'\"\nNew album comin soon baby\nWhat's my favorite word?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cbce7a2bf9547c73552eb8d05ea5f8b2.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
