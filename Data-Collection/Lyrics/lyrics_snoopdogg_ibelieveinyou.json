(how I picture)\nIt's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you\nWe're flowing smooth just like a river... (like a river)\nExpress my true\nWhen, I make love to you... (to you)\nJust like that day back in September\nIf we might run in some problems\nI know you'll see me through\nThere's nothing for you I won't do\nCause I believe in you... (you)\nOh I believe in you... (you)\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nAnd I believe in you too\nSee can't nobody make me do what you do\nI mean I'm so in love with you... (boo)\nI never thought a girl could make me\nTake me\nTo a whole new world\nRe-shape me, love me, hate me\nLately\nWe ain't been fussing or fighting\nYou play all day and I be working at night and\nThe only one who understands my life and\nThe cake and the icing\nThese other girls\nIn the world\nLive their life so trifling\nI couldn't do it no more\nI had to sit you down\nAnd make you my wife and... (yaa)\nCold thing\nBut you know\nIt's a cold gain... (goal gain)\nIt's so real\nI had to bless you with my last name... (last name)\nSlowed me down\nStraight took me out the fast lane... (fast lane)\nHold me down\nCome on baby\nWatch me do this thing...

(grown)\nLook at me... (me)\nI'm like a baby\nI took that chance\nAnd I feel secure about this love romance\nLet's have some fun\nAnd I believe when you say\nAin't that special... (oh)\nTouch my soul... (soul)\nFeel the same\nWhen you whisper softly\nAnd call my name\nHere I come\nIt's more than words that I ever could sing\nYou're that chill bring\nMaybe your walk or just the way you do me\nI really think we are the two\nCause I believe in you\nTake a second realize we can make it if you\nDon't stop\nCome on boy we about to take it\nTo the top\nI know you're gonna love what you're about to see\nDo you believe in me?\nWe can make it all nite long\nBaby if we\nDon't stop\nCome on boy you know you got me\nSo hot\nI know I'm gonna love what you're about to do\nCause I believe in you\nI believe in you\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nAnd I believe in you too\nCause its the right thing to do\nAnd I believe in you too\nCause its the only thing to do\nI couldn't give you away\nNo matter what my friends sizzay\nSee when I'm gone\nAway from home\nI'm alone every dizzay\nI left a gang of messages for you\nOn your two way\nBut you ain't hollered back\nBut you know how, you play\nYou say, ok\nI say, no way\nWe got to be together forever\nAnd a dizzay\nCause I believe in you\n\n[Latoiya Williams]\nTake a second realize we can make it if we\nDon't stop\nCome on boy we about to take it\nTo the top\nI know you're gonna love what you're about to see\nDo you believe in me?\nWe can make it all nite long\nBaby if we\nDon't stop\nCome on boy you know you got me\nSo hot\nI know I'm gone love what you're about to do\nCause I believe in you\nI'm so glad that you believe in me like I believe in you\nThis love's exactly how I picture\nIt's such a joy when I receive all that I need in you\nWe're flowing smooth just like a river...
