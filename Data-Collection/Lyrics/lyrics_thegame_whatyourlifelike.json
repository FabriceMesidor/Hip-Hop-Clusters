Mine's 'bout gettin' money and bitches\n64s and switches, poppin' guns with my niggas\nWhat your life like? Mine's 'bout listenin' to Illmatic\nIn my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average\nWhat your life like? Mine's 'bout sheddin' tears when Pac died\nSwimming in money like the Rothschilds\nNigga, what your life like?\nNigga, what your life like?\nTell me; what your life like?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI done have conversations with Timbo\nPassed on a couple Pharrell and Swizz instrumentals\nI done wore a two piece tux on Jimmy Kimmel\nThen came to the hood and whopped your ass like I was Kimbo\nI done lost 20 millions on lawyer fees\nBut I'mma get it back when I sue Jimmy for my royalties\nI done had Scott Storch recordin' me\nDrove through Compton with the doors up\u2014ain't no ignornin' me\nI done took shots at Jay, I done took shots of 'Gnac\nI done took shots for Cedar\u2014five couldn't drop me flat\nR.I.P. to Frog, R.I.P. to Will\nHe was just as ill as Will, so I know how Nas feel\nNigga, I'm the greatest\n\"300 Bars\" was like 15 minutes long\u2014tell me, how many times you played it?\nHow many times you had your Documentary stolen and replaced it?\nThat's that five-million-out-the-gate shit\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm still here\u2014they said I wasn't welcome\nCame in the game and then everybody felt him\nWhat your life like? Mine's 'bout gettin' money and bitches\n64s and switches, poppin' guns with my niggas\nWhat your life like? Mine's 'bout listenin' to Illmatic\nIn my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average\nWhat your life like? Mine's 'bout sheddin' tears when Pac died\nSwimming in money like the Rothschilds\nNigga, what your life like?\nNigga, what your life like?\nTell me; what your life like?\n\n[Outro]\nTell me; what your life like?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5470139be6822474317a28c8796fb0da.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
