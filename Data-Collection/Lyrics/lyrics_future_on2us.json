Is he trapping? Bitch, I'm in my own lane\nDriving down 75 in a foreign vehicle\nOn my way to my people\nI close examine every vehicle\nI can't say what it is right now\nI can tell it something fishy going on\nEsco and I smell it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSpent 5 bands on a fit and wore it for three days\nI got 3 main bitches ain't no telling where I stay\nHit the studio all day to stop myself from catching plays\nI know the alphabet they looking for the rappers with them K's\nMy life is more than a stage paranoid why you watchin\nIs you watching me preform or is you watching cause you copying\nTry to convict me on the ice: I'm rocking\nCould it be my ears\nMan tell me what it is all these damn designer gear\nI'm bout to stop rocking jewelry I can't tell who people is\nJust by looking in the crowd you looking blurry over here\nSomething bout to happen in a minute I can't tell it\nSomething fishy going on X-Rayed and I smell it!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0dc7f94974057cd63dca84d71cb50adf.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
