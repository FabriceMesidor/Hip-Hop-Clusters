(yes)\nMeaning that under heat you wouldn't nare leak it\nSo when your woman's in your presence don't you dare speak it\nPillow talkin' get you caught up and brought up on charges\nShot up a lot and departed, it's nothin' short of retarded\n'Cause when you say stuff and then you and your woman break up\nYou funkin' because your mouth wouldn't stay shut\nHow could you spread that? Can't believe you said that\nPuttin' my life in jeopardy definitely it'll make the feds tap\nBed trap\nWhat you tell your lady can make you take a dead nap\nFluff up your pillow and lay your head back\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin'\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nMy advice to niggas is this: you can never trust no chick\nIt don't matter how silky the ho can stroke your dick\nIt don't matter how slimy the pussy hole gon' get\nIf a nigga talks to these bitches these hoes gon' snitch\nShit, I used to fuck this bitch\nHad a husband with dope money and I had his snow bunny\nClimbin' the bed post, feedin' her dog meat\nIn love with the nine inch, she steady calls me\nTells me she's leavin', I know the reason\nShe know where the guns at, the lock box, keys and\nThe floor safe combo and this here one ho\nWas this dude's bad news, knock on the front door\nA man in a police suit, a girl with a black tooth\nGet to the money, she saw him countin' in the back room\nBut it doesn't end here, the man with the cop suit\nShoots at the bitch once, pops and drops dude\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you), don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI can tell you what the problem is: people try to be monogamous\nTell his woman a lot of shit\nAnd he thinkin' he got him a bottom bitch\nStop with the sentimental talks at night\nIf you're pillow talkin', then you oughta quit\nWhen the heat come with the quickness\nLookin' for the witness, man your broad is it\nWhy you wanna spit it? I don't really get it\nGivin' your woman the power to speak in a minute\nSpeakin' about a brother wanna cover your mud up\nWith the N9na but you the only one know I really did it\nWhen it come back then you feel low\nBecause everyone know you ain't real though\n'Cause them beans you spillin'\nYou known for squealin' and all you needed was a pillow\n\"I should have did the dirt, all by my lonely\" like Treach say\nBut the company that you keep end up bein' phony\nSo the TEC spray\nNever let no chick I hit get with that homie\n'Cause the next day, she seein' right through me\nGot them lenses on me like an X-Ray\nAnd I'm fed up with these rappers\nWho be yappin' to these groupies\nThey flash them a little coochie\nThen you blab and try to reduce me\nAnd it always come back to me\nSo when I come through strapped with an Uzi\nIt ain't like \"Damn why'd he shoot me?\"\nUsin' the Nueve name too loosely\n\n[Hook: Girl, Krizz Kaliko & (Tech N9ne)]\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you), don't be pillow talkin', don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\nYou (huh) be pillow talkin' (yeah)\nYou (I'm talking to you) don't be pillow talkin' don't say nothin'\nYou", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ce6124bde0d76994fd0d3a8ddb1d4e97.1000x994x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
