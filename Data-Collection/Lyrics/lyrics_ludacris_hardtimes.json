Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song\nI know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right\nCause life is like a big fight\nI'm stickin-and-movin, tryin to get my shit right\nMy family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me\nKinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty\nAnd they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same\nIt's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game\nThis industry FUCKED UP\nThat's right I said it, and it's fake as ever\nKeep real niggas around me, stay Space Age 4 Eva\nPo-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree\nBut if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me\nYour son was DUI, but my momma made it by\nI didn't shed no tears when you left me\nBut the rest of the family cried\nTrials and tribulations, ruined my concentration\nLosin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Two: Eightball]\nAs this Valium slowly starts to kick in\nThem subconcious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin\nThis whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin\nBabies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them\nEverybody wanna blame music for they bad kids\nSittin up in the court talkin 'bout Eminem made me do what I did\nMy own hard times rolled in like the fog\nTry to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts\nMy momma, in 1967, pickin cotton\nWhile other blacks was gettin liberated, boycottin\nMy old man was a player, ain't no hidin that\nHe started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack\nI never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker\nHe left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter\nI tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it\nIt's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: MJG]\nA drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes\nIn the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe\nWe made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night\nDo talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life\nMy momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me\nKnowin without a, household father, things could get crazy\nSometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all\nBut nevertheless, momma was with me through it all\nI graduated out of nothin, not out of school, it was like\n12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin cool\nI might as well, be focusin on me tryin to get paid\nUsin these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade\nOur team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage\nIt was just like a piece of pussy\nIt fucked me long as I stayed\nBut still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin now please help me out the water\nIt can't get no harder\nHelp me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow\n\n[Hook] - 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1498cf277a7dc50ffc916ca191c3608f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
