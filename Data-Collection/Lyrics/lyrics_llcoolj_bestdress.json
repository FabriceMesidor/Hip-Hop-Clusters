Uh)\nOnce we start it ain't no stoppin', girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)\nThis is for the girls\nWith all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)\nBut we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J, (Jamie Foxx) + Both]\n54-11's poppin' wheelies front of Willyburgers\nCandy apple M3's, slidin' out gently\nRollin' up in Bentleys, Tyson was the champ then\nRight after the Rooftop, years before the Hamptons\nYou was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough\nYou was so beautiful and the world was so rough\nYour man was locked up 'cause the cops popped up\nYou dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up\nHe was yo' crush, you was his crutch\nHe'll be gone a dime and it's hard to stay in touch\nYour moms say you stupid but you love him so much (ooh)\nNow it's, broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust\nStandin' up on a crowded bus, for college courses\nStay on course when it gets rough, you never lost it\nStay strong baby trust, you'll be back flossin'\nDiamond studs and linen crush, keep your head up\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (LL Cool J)]\nWe gon' get it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)\nOnce we start it ain't no stoppin', girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)\nThis is for the girls\nWith all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)\nBut we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J + Both]\nHer boyfriend's comin' through with them hickeys on his neck\nHe claims he's lovin' her but never shows her no respect\nAll she knows is neglect, a lifetime of stress\nBig momma, her momma, now lil' momma is next\nYou can see the effects of gettin' treated incorrect\n'Cause she let the cycle continue, make excuses for his steps\nHer girlfriends tried to warn her, all he wanted was the sex\nOnce he get it, then he gone, then it's on to somethin' fresh\nSomethin' new, nuttin' borrowed, nuttin' blue, no wedding dress\nBut that's aight, you still young, you got your lifetime left\nYou gotta leave all that alone, find yourself\nThere's no love until you love you, remind yourself\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx, (LL Cool J) & Both]\nWe gon' get it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)\nOnce we start it ain't no stoppin', girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!! Uh)\nThis is for the girls\nWith all those ghetto curves (hey, hey, hey!!)\nBut we gon' keep it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!)\n\n[Bridge: LL Cool J, (Jamie Foxx) + Both]\nTo all my ghetto girls all around the world\nYou know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls\nKeep fightin', uhh\nBaby girl keep fightin', yeah\nTo all my ghetto queens survivin' by all means\nThere's a rock and a hard place you somewhere in between\nBaby girl keep fightin', uhh\nBaby girl keep fightin', yeah\nTo all my single mommas you been strugglin' with drama (ooh)\nDoin what'chu gotta but still keepin' your honor\nBaby girl keep fightin', uhh\nBaby girl keep fightin', yeah yeah, sing it\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx, (LL Cool J) & Both]\nWe gon' get it poppin' now, girl\nGet your best dress on tonight (hey, hey, hey!!
