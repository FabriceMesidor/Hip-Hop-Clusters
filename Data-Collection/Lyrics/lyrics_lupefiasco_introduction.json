Is it possible?\n\nWhy do we have to be a military superpower?\nWhy can't we be a humanitarian superpower?\nInstead of sending planes for bombs\nWhy don't we send planes for food and medicine?\n\n[Soldier One]\nOh shit, it's one of the machines\nLooks like it's trapped under something, it's broken or something\n\n[Soldier Two]\nLet's get out here -- we cannot stay\n\n[Soldier One]\nHold on lemme get my keyboard, I can re-program this thing\n\n[Soldier Two]\nIt doesn't matter. Leave it!\n\n[Soldier One]\nNo seriously, I can do it -- just give me a second!\n\n[Computer -- continuously]\nReprogramming unsuccessful\n\n[Machine -- continuously]\nEnemy -- I kill people\n\n[Soldier One]\nI swear to God, man, I can do this! I can do this!\nCross your fingers\nYou have to work!\nAll right, this is the last time\n\n[Computer]\nReprogramming successful\n\n[Soldier One]\nYes!\n\n[Machine]\nFriend..I.. fight.. evil..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/519da23233c0aee9cd94e2ea433cf9d8.320x320x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
