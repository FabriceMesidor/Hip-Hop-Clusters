We were gonna play dead, roll over and add up losses\nDamn fools\nNo more playin' cool politicking with the rules eat fools in the carcass\nCause we back well season the leave\nAnd don't believe the vegan on sausage\nBut don't ride dick now, and act like your light bulb's lit now\nKeep signin' the killers and fat drug dealers really the big shit now\n(Take a big shit now)\nI gotta state these niggas be weak runnin' round like they nuts cut loose\nCan't even shake a nigga hand gotta dab a nigga up\nFuck around and touch butt fuck juice\nMayday to the pay day to they say we stay don't cut that noose\nYes, off with the heads then it's off to the bed\nGettin' head like duck-duck-goose (Awoo!)\nTechnicians form a petition to never ever let it up\nOn a rapper that sucks in this industry fucks\nWith a bucks that wanna hit and swarm from a duck\nCrystal meth, cocaine, e pills\nWith a little weed fill and a lotta freewill\nAdd a couple refills to whenever we spill\nWon't see thrills like these skills on a steep hill\nThat's some hott shit, that's hott shit\nOne more time, don't ride dick\nShit I got us creepin' on your level\nAqualeo now that's speakin' of the devil", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d81918b5eb66018731d6fb1da718ea1e.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
