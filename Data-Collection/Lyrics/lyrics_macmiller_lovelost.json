What'd you do?\nHow the hell you make me fall in love with you?\n(But now we found it)\nYou lay with me, now you're gone and\nAll I've got is this damn song\n(And if you cross your heart)\nSo I can feel but I can't touch\nYou said my love was a bit too much\nBroke my heart, can't find no crush\nSo why don't you come on back home?\n\n[Verse 1: Mac Miller]\nHey, I'm a fuckin workaholic with a passion in my heart\nTreatin' rappin' as a art, which you have to be apart of\nI just copped a new car to hear it's all up\nTry to do the right thing and please karma\nAll I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go?\nI've been waiting on you baby\nWhy don't you leave and come on home?\nI can't be mad, I'm living my dream\nGoing all around the globe\nThough you said you think you love me\nYou need to let me know\nSo I've been fucking all these hoes\nAnd I've been blowing all this cash\nCause baby this just the beginning\nAnd I'mma make all of it back\n\n[Hook]\n(Our love was lost)\nWhere'd you go? What'd you do?\nHow the hell you make me fall in love with you?\n(But now we found it)\nYou lay with me, now you're gone and\nAll I've got is this damn song\n(And if you cross your heart)\nSo I can feel but I can't touch\nYou said my love was a bit too much\nBroke my heart, can't find no crush\nSo why don't you come on back home?\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nIt's all good, everybody trying to eat tonight\nTrying to go to sleep having good dreams tonight\nGo home, might get better\nAll I know: It don't last forever\nSo take it while you got it, try to get a little more\nThey say I'm getting better than I've ever been before\nAnd that's for sure, tell 'em what I do\nRap keep me filled like a spoon getting soup\nI've been out here on the road\nAnd now they missing me at home\nAll these ex-girls that I used to know are hitting up my phone\nBut I ain't here\nI guess you can't call back\nSex, drugs and rock-and-roll, I think I'll take all that\n\n[Hook]\n(Our love was lost)\nWhere'd you go? What'd you do?\nHow the hell you make me fall in love with you?\n(But now we found it)\nYou lay with me, now you're gone and\nAll I've got is this damn song\n(And if you cross your heart)\nSo I can feel but I can't touch\nYou said my love was a bit too much\nBroke my heart, can't find no crush\nSo why don't you come on back home?\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nHuh Huh, But it gets no better than this\nHuh, Yeah it gets no better than this\nYeah\nYeah, It get no better\nYeah, It get no better\nYeah, It get no better\nThis shit forever\nGet no better\nGet no better\nYeah, it get no better\nYeah, this shit forever\nBum, didi bum bum bum bum bum\nBum you can cut it here!... and then were done", "image": "https://images.genius.com/781a2ead216a063ed9bf5ff4df530fd8.275x275x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
