Taylor\nOh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*\nGotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade\nIt's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*\nGotta make some sense, from this mess that we made\n\nYou're doin everything momma told ya not to do\nNow you're tryin to walk away cause ya know it's true\nYour sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed\nTo admit you both have the same last name\nI don't have to ask you where you've been\nCause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn\n\"A mind is a terrible thing to waste\" that was the slogan\nBut now it's ninety-five and it's \"Don't forget the Trojan\"\nExplained it to her momma, before somebody get her\nGotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin niggas\nLove is the word, seldom meant but often heard\nLatex safe sex you better learn\nOr get hip to the facts before you react or end up in a box on your back\nSometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got\nDon't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot\n\nOh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*\nGotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade\nIt's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*\nGotta make some sense, from this mess that we made\n\nAnother day in the city and, oh what a pity\nEven though we did our duty things are still lookin shitty\nEverybody in the pack stacked, tryin to make some scratch\nWalkin in the rain but they ain't got no hat\nUnderstand how we livin in the nineties loc\nNuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke\nSex lies videotape and rape\nJust a little bump n grind can seal your fate\nWe need to do something drastic, shit is gettin tragic\nAnd if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic\nEverybody an they momma preachin abstinence, these kids ain't checkin for absti-shit\nSo put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust\nAnother victim of the lust, in God we trust\nWhat started off as a plan ended up in the plot\nWater can't cool it off cause it's too damn hot\n\nOh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*\nGotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade\nIt's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*\nGotta make some sense, from this mess that we made\n\nOh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*\nGotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade\nIt's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*\nGotta make some sense, from this mess that we made", "image": "https://images.genius.com/80e7d4d7290ea57cc76b3c5e101a8d2f.755x755x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
