and I gotta tote the (Cannon)\nListen close, I got duct tape and rope\nI leave you missing like the fucking O'bannons\nOne hand on my money, one hand on my buddy\nThat's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me\nBullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming\nDon't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach\nNiggas know I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?\nOne egg short of the omelet\nSimon says: \"shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg\"\nAnd tell him \"catch up\" like mayonnaise\nUm, I'm the sickest nigga doing it, bet that baby\nThese other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby\nYes, get back, get back boy, this a setback\nClumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a debt trap\nThem boys pussy, born without a backbone\nAnd if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones\nWet em up, I hope he got his towel on\nI aim at your moon and get my howl on\nSome niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush\nAnd when it come to that paper I stack books\nYou heard what I said\nI can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head\nLife ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee\nShout out my nigga Fee\nSee every motherfucka at the door don't get a key\nYou're outside looking in, so tell me what you see\nIt's about money, it's bigger than me\nI tell my homies: \"don't kill him, bring the nigga to me\"\nYeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman\nKidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nStraight up, I ain't got no conversation for you\nNigga talk to the (Cannon)\nYeah, have a few words with the (Cannon)\nYeah, tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon)\nStraight up, I ain't got no conversation for you\nNigga talk to the (Cannon)\nYeah, have a few words with the (Cannon)\nYeah, tell it to my motherfucking (Cannon)\n\n[Verse 2: Freeway]\nFrom Philly to where I'm landing I'm a (Cannon)\nAnd I'm on that Philly fighting shit and I come fully equipped\nYou trolley, get bodied, keep nina and shotty in the whip\nIf a nigga try to stick me I'mma blam him\nSing along now, di-di-dadi, I'm Free, got the butters\nGot the green, he got the tan, got the whole enchilada\nOwe me dough, I'm inside of ya house, tie up ya brother\nMake the prick call up ya mother, she might know where to find you\nI am on top of my job, the heavyweight champ of the flowers\nFlow like the ocean, open water, ya drowning, I will\nFour-pound him and sink him, heat him, then leave him stinking\nSharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him, I will\nRoll over your squad like I'm \"One Punch\" Carr\nYou chumps, you best call General Motors, I will\nTake control of your soldiers, you won't miss 'em\n'Til I toss em in the wok like chicken, General Tso, uh-oh!\n\n[Verse 3: Willie the Kid]\nI make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure\nMatter of fact I'm motivation to rap better\nI showed niggas how to act, how to dress better\nI stay fresh, more fitted caps than bad catchers\nI'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule\nThe gat, the strap, the gun, the tool\nThe motherfucking (Cannon)\nOther words, I'm the real, for real\nWe can go check for check or bill for bill\nWe can go chick for chick or skill for skill\nThe deal is sealed, niggas ain't real as Will, 'cause I'm a (Cannon)\nAnd I handle well, pedal like Cannondale\nAnd I got the 50-cal mag, its a handheld (Cannon)\nI'm telling you niggas, I pop, put a shell in you niggas\nMy nice watch'll Helen Keller you niggas\nI got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over\nBlowing 'ghan by the quarter, weed odor in the Rover, nigga\n\n[Verse 4: Detroit Red]\nDetroit Red gettin' change like them white folks\nDump it out the window of the Range with the rifle\nPain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle\nYou better scurry when I pull the (Cannon)\nTracks burn the streets like a truck do the gas\nI love head and caressing a voluptuous ass\nI ask ya baby mama is she up to the task\nShe like \"Damn Red, it's bigger than (Cannon)\"\nMy attire makes the ladies say ya man is too fly\nImported oils from Iran and Dubai\nGet caught slipping with ya mans and you die\nWhere I'm from niggas be quick to squeeze the (Cannon)\nDetroit Red always got some shit for ya ear\nShow me love but keep it moving man, cause if you get near\nI'll say, get off my dick and tell ya bitch to come here\n'Cause you sweating me and my DJ Don (Cannon)\n\n[Verse 5: Juice]\nLegs spread far out, you know how I'm standing\nYeah I'm posted with the big homie (Cannon)\nI got niggas who don't like rap lovin' our shit\nWe got niggas who was stuck on Pac bumpin' our shit\nThese niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately\nA good batter when they at the mound its gravy\nNiggas salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella\nJust a cigarillo, filled with Tropicana\nYeah, Vic found that lick now we not smoking no more regular\nKeep ya mid-grade, I don't think you know no better\nThey love \"In Da Trunk\", now they wanna hear more shit\nI play it modest like \"nigga that's some of our old shit,\"\nGot niggas I ain't never met wanting to fight me\nGot hoes that's in love asking \"why you don't like me\"?\nBitch I'm married to the game and I love my wifey\nSteppin' over competition, man I love these Nikes\nYeah, I'm hot, they fanning\nNiggas try to copy my style like the Canon\nDon't try to compare I'm in a league of my own\nIf I ain't listed at the top, nigga the stats is wrong\nAll the data is off, ya info ain't valid\nArtist of the century the competition ain't balanced\nTrue like Master P and his two brothers\nDon't call it incest, but Juice the motherfucker, like\nChyeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8a5c3f9d154fdeca5af9683f88fab70f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
