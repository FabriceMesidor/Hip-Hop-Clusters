(Fuck it)\nThey don't notice if I never go and show my face (Face)\nThey just looking for a reason they can celebrate (That's okay)\nI hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me (Tasty)\nI tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em (Boring)\nI'll just lay down here inside the studio (Uh-huh)\nDoing blow and paraphrasing The Crucible (Witch!)\nIf you fucking with the God, that's a funeral (Kill 'em)\nLose your soul, I\u2019m witcha longer than your student loans (Woah)\nWho got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll (Raw)\nI'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know\nSomebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down (Stop man! Please, please, please! Please!)\nHe's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now (Bapapapapam! Aaah!)\nHe'll regret it when I hit the ground (What did I do!?)\nFor now, everybody gather round\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's happy birthday! (Woo)\nIt's a birthday party! (Yeah)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Sing me a motherfucking song)\nIt's your birthday party! (Sing me a motherfucking song)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Yeah)\nIt's your birthday party! (Come on!)\nHappy birthday (Come on! Come on!)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Come on! Come on!)\nYeah, okay\n\n[Verse 2]\nHappy birthday, (Thanks)\nHow the fuck you feel? (Good!)\nDo you ever sit and wonder what is real? (Huh?)\nDo you ever reach to touch her but there's nothing there? (There)\nDo you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? (Care)\nDoes she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? (No!)\nDid you hear about a heaven now you running there? (Go!)\nDo you think about the fantasy and make-believe? (Okay)\nDo you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? (Look)\nLately, I've been having strange dreams (Uh-huh)\nParanoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy\nBaby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? (Uh-huh)\nYou can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you (Let's go, let's go, let's go)\nI do see myself as iconic (Yah!)\nGetting high my downfall it's kinda ironic\nLike a condom they on it (Woah!)\nGot 'em in my pocket (Woah!)\nNo time to worry, hurry up and light the candles\nEverybody (Woo!)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's happy birthday! (Woo)\nIt's a birthday party! (Sing me a motherfucking song)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Sing me a motherfucking song)\nIt's your birthday party! (Everybody sing along!)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Sing me a motherfucking song)\nIt's your birthday party! (Everybody sing along, come on!)\nHappy birthday (Come on!)\nYeah, happy birthday! (Come on! Come on! Come on!
