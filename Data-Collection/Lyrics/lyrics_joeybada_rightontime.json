I swear that her love is just a sin\nWe back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'\nBreak up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in\nThen mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten\nNow we some trippy niggas as high as a fin\nBut what's your game, love? Already know it\nWe some ordinary people but extraordinary poets\nGet lost in the Moet when I po' it\nFuck it if we drownin' in pain, 'cause we don't really show it\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Tweet]\nRight on time, you are my love\nThis ain't nothing like consistence, persistence\nWhen we switching positions\nMy mission's to put you in the best conditions\nRight on time, you are my love\nThis ain't nothing like consistence, persistence\nWhen we switching positions\nMy mission's to put you in the best conditions\n\n[Refrain: Tweet]\nMy eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm\nMy eyes have never seen someone so beautiful, so much charm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccc6b3e099d7f0a3416209e4a5d67fd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
