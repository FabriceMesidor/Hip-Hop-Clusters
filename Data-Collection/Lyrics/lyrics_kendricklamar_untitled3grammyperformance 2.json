Why couldn't he throw a punch?\nAnd for our community do you know what this does?\nAdd to a trail of hatred\n2012 was taped for the world to see\nSet us back another 400 years\nThis is modern day slavery\nThe reason why I'm by your house\nYou threw your briefcase all on the couch\nI plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out\nEvery piece of your brain\n'Til your son jumped in your arm\nCut off the engine then sped off in the rain\nI'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk\nHad the vodka on the top\nHow come I can long time\nHow come I could make it popular?\nPuff on what I want\nHow come I could make it popular?\nPuff on what I want\nSee I'm living with anxiety\nGiving up sobriety\nCussing with his sister\nAnd playing with society\nJustice ain't free\nTherefore justice ain't me\nTry and justify staying, obituary\nWhy you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?\nOnce upon a time, I go to church and talk to God\nNow I'm thinking to myself\nHollow tips is all I got\nNow I'm drinking by myself\nAt the end of Section Park\nCaught you when you walk besides your house\nYou threw your briefcase all on the couch\nI plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out\nEvery piece of your brain\n'Til your spine drip to your arm\nCut off the engine then sped off in a wraith\nI said Hiiipower, one time you see it\nHiiipower, two times, you see it\nHiiipower, two times you see it\nConversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ab83d7fe00e02f91d79b09d66f771e6d.600x398x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
