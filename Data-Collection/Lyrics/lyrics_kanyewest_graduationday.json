You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage, you won\u2019t slide across that stage! A muthafucka can\u2019t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting! I\u2019m tryin' to get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga. And I don\u2019t mean that in no nice way. Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you. You throw your muthafuckin hands in the air, and wave good-bye to every-mothafuckin-body! Cause you gettin' the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now?\n\n[John Legend]\nI'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody\nI'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody\nI got something better than school, so don't tell anybody\nMy momma would kill me, so don't tell anybody\nShe wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody\nShe ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
