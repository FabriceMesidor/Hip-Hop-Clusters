Raw by the laws of attraction\nFor future generation's information - the black one\n... Move the crowd like a buddha cloud\nThe purple, puff puff pass 'round the circle\nA jerk well renowned for his work skill\nHe's out, the proof is the computer's down Urkel\nMC a show via wi-fi\nAnd paid way before we wrap it up like tie-dye\nHip-Hop sci-fi you can see\nHe had the eye of the tiger through the mask like the Fry Guy\nJust made a baby Olmec dome check\nLeft some folks' ancestors home wreck\nWith blown backs these lesser known facts thwart evil\nIt got no reason, like short people\nNo offense, his feet was burnt brass\nWhenever he walked on the street it turned glass\nOn his lucky rat's paw in the crap drawer\nAll the world's a stage, where's the trap door, slackjaw\nLogic, to keep your mind in the project\nDrop the check, his job is to chop necks\nThat's just payback for noses there's no psych though\nWhat they don't know like Bo\nWon't hurt Diddley squat\nGot to be kiddin me, not\nSeriously plot, to put a hit out on a G-spot\nGypped like Egypt out their kettles and they teapot", "image": "https://images.genius.com/263743633b6e58854e753b25dca6beab.430x430x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
