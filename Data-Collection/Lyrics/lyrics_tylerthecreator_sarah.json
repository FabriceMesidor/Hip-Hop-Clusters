(Nigga hell no)\nFuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe? (No)\nMaybe? (I'm sorry)\nMaybe? (I got a date)\nMaybe? (Where's your dad?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me\nBut she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's\nI want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement\nKeep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went\n\n- Tyler, what you doing?\n- Shut the fuck up!\n- Uh-umm..\n- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch\n- Uhh..\n- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head\n\nBut all I really want is a kiss on the cheek\nIn private, not public in the streets\nAnd your cupcake how we eat and your toes\nCause I got a big fetish with the feet\nI just want somebody I can see\nYou can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me\nI'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much\nYour heart literally is what I do want for lunch\nNow this shit is turning to a habit\nI'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way\nAnd truthfully girl you really make my day\nI would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay\nAnd I can't even look the other way\nYour aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive\nL-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'\nAnd I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role\nClimbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold\nAnd I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\nAnother love song about shit\nAnd I'll be rich if I get another diss\nAnd maybe Cupid won't miss\n\n[Verse 3]\nHalf your body laying on my chest\nThe rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast\nAnd I'ma just take another guess\nNow you probably wishing that you would have said yes\nAm I crazy? Maybe\nBut fucked up is how I been lately\nShit, I don't give a fuck\nYour family looking for you, wish 'em good luck\nBitch, you tried to play me like a dummy\nNow you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody\nAnd I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy\nLooking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?\nWhat did you want from me?\nWhat did you want from me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cb0b25f99dd81109efa8db270a933a38.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
