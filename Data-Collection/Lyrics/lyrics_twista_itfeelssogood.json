Fresh in the flesh\nThink I'm blessed with the zest after slippin on my slick fit\nThe high discover me, hit the front porch\nTwo women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone\nI sent the bitch in the bed home, cause one of them\nGot chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone\nWhere y'all goin y'all thick as hell\nWhat's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit\nI got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit\nCall up the buddies you be tight with\nWe ain't really gon be doin too much though\nWe just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes\nTappin the horn at the homies that gangbang\nAnd slang 'caine to maintain to mob's the same thing\nOr we can chill at the crib and play spades or kick some ass a bit\nSpeedpass the clit and get passionate\nGrab the buckle and unfasten it\nAnd we can get into some ol' nasty shit\nLive if I could decide to try, don't play me bogus\nThis ain't no spin move and I ain't got no time to lie\nTell your girls we gonna be sliding by\nBut hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high\nCause it feels so good\n\n[Hook]\nIt feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\n\n[Verse 2]\nMe and my homies hooked up some cowards took up\nWhen niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight\nTrippin off how we survivin this rugged terrain\nAnd try to hang tight getting fucked up on game night\nUsed to be gang fights now we gotta try to relax with the strap\nEven we sent Deebo back to back to back\nWe still be holdin' stacks of packs\nRollin through wit black blacks\nAsh trays with blunts, regs, and crack sacks\nHustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on\nFiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on\nIf ain't no strokin we strollin along\nRollin the chrome out really trippin\nBecause we take the smoke to the dome\nBumpin the tunes while bigger roles and herringbones\nGlisten from all the sunlight\nPeepin the fe's with their hair done tight\nBooty hung right and every night we see at least one fight\nHookin up with my fellow Westside cliques\nNow together we mush\nBut when are we strapped through and rug cutters\nDespite the envy and jealousy throughout the other is love brothers\nRidin every one of y'all my muhfuckers\nSo put the Black Magic on the tires and get the wax off the chrome\nWe gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown\nHopin to get my thang on\nNot matter what block you stay on kick it\nRound the world it's the same song\n(so the Mobsters just flame on)\nFor scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood\nNow we got up on hittin the cuz\nFrom stealin' tips where they're swum the doves\nMo' we got up on some bud\nStraight hittin' up the block searching for love\nReach up and hit the deep lung then we gone\nSmokin delight the body right what the party like\nAre you as live as I come roll with meso we can ride the sky\nBut only if you let me play with you while we ridin' high\nCause it feels so good\n\n[Hook]\nIt feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\n\n[Verse 3]\nSittin back cruising through the slow breeze\nThinkin how can I get mo' cheese\nBumpin a system costin 4 G's\nI stay on my P's for the po-P's\nSplit the Phillie with my door keys\nScoop a female to the crib good get my boy to bring a blessin through\nSit on the floor playin Tekken 2\nLesson two I'm adressin you\nTurn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew\nBring out the best in you\nConfessin true lies about your inner thighs\nAnd where they been hopin maybe you be my lady\nWhat's the potatoes without the gravy\nWhat you feelin on maybe soft with the silicone baby\nBut can you pay me?\nCause daily we be riding in the dope stroll\nWhile rockin dope flows I'll lose the spot if I choose to stop\nWe can cruise some blocks and talkin' about\nHow later on you comin' out your clothes, shoes and socks\nNow is that news or not?\nCome I step on the gas slow and smoke on this last \"O\"\nGet a \"B\" and split it now watch me kill it\nTinted windows took a sealin' off in the Astro\nOn billets take a choke on so I can really feel it\nThinkin' about not having the rich life\nBut the hood life was still a good life\nAnd that we know always and forever though\nFor ever more rollin through the ghetto with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good\n\n[Hook]\nIt feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nIt feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nIt feels so good how we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go\nAnd it feels so good the way we kick it in the hood like so good\n(When we ridin high)\nRollin through the hood with Phillies and hoes\nStraight pimpin with nowhere to go", "image":
