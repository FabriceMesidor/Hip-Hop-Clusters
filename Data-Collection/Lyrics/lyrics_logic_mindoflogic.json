Music. Fans. Grinding. Shows. Music. Touring. Money. Faith. Music. God. Fear. Bills. Friends. Enemies. Family. Music\n\n[Verse 1: Logic]\nStep into the mind of a young man\nAnd if you don't then I don't really give a damn\nAll I wanna do is make you understand\nBut if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't a part of the plan\nSorry if I digress\nAll I ever wanted was to be the best\nThrough lyricism to put your mind to the test\nStayin' up, late night, no rest\nFeelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess\nMy mind's a mess, living in a world of stress I digest\nBut I gotta keep grinding\n'Cause everyday success what I'm finding\nAnd I don't give a damn if you hate on me\n'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?\nHeh, not a goddamn thing\nBut that's enough of that, I'ma let my home girl sing\n\n[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nAll I think about is music\nDon't get me wrong I think\nAbout other things but this how I fuse it\nSo the whole wide world can use it\nWhen you feel like you just might lose it\nTake a breath, homie, don't confuse it\nTake a step in the mind of Logic\nAs long as you don't abuse it\nSo let me break it down for the whole world\nLike I broke it down for my old girl\nI can't deal with your bullshit\nNo more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl\n'Cause I remember the time\nWhen I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes\nBut the whole world told me never mind\nI'm a star, how could I not shine?\n\n[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nI just wanna take it to another level\nThat I never even been on so I can sit on\nEvery single piece of paper that I put a pen on\nAnd when I been on for like ten years\nI'ma do it better than anybody before me\nSo the whole wide world will adore me, ain't no need to assure me\nAnd if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast\nIt's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind\nThat wanna come out at the same time\nIn other words I'm racin'\nI used to pursue my dreams\nBut now they're reality and that's what I'm chasin'\nWhy are we on this Earth?\nWhy must we feel pain?\nWhy does everybody feel the need\nTo judge one another when we're all the same?\n\n[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6118bfdbbde22320e3c6bc130e1772d3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
