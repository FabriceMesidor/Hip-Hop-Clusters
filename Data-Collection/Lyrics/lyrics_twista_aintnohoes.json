hold up, got the competition sewed up, go get me something to roll up\nAnd I spit it for my niggas and bitches I know in the ghetto\nAnd all of my ballers and my family doing fed time\nAnd everybody thats hating on the science of this alliance\nFor violence high instance I'll show you its bed time\nCrack to herbs, sendin niggas back to work\nBone thugs you can't ask for more\nGotta hit em with what the fans asking for\nAin't no way that you can fuck with the fantastic four\nNiggas dont wanna see me, cause they know that ima do ya\nAnd leave you totally crushed\nWhen I told Mr.Ouija that I wanna know my future\nHe told me that it was us now what you talkin bout\n\n[Hook: Twista and Krayzie Bone]\nStandin firmly on the corner like a soulja\nLet it ride on them niggas\nGotta show em that

is in the music so you can't deny we changing times (why)\nHistory is in the making nigga get ready for this thug invasion\nAnd lots of money making\nHundred millions we could learn to make a killin real niggas\nAnd too bad for the contenders\nWe can spit it, and go round for round (round for round)\nTake em straight back to the underground (underground)\nBone and Twist on some shit like this\nMake a nigga stop quick like whats that sound (whats that sound)\nYou fanna hear a nigga really fuckin dope\nAnd got that nigga Twista creepin on the cause\nSwisha full of bud\nGive a nigga love\nFeel it through the blood\nThis is for the Thugs (what)\nMaintain all day on the paper chase\nThe fame came but I rather just take the pay\nMan I rather take the millions and not be out on the market\nOr a target for a killing, really\nSo my tech-9 right there when you test mine\nImmediatley stretched out\nWe breathe for the Mid-West side\n\n[Hook: Twista and Krayzie Bone]\nStandin firmly
