You got to find a way to survive\n'Cause they win when your soul dies\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nBaby please don\u2019t cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don\u2019t cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don\u2019t cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don\u2019t cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don\u2019t cry", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
