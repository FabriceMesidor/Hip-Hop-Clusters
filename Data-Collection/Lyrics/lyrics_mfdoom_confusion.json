Desperately\nSearching for a way out of the maze. Running blindly not\nFeeling the floor, nothing to stand on we fall. Lost in\nThe halls, I'm looking for the doors. Confusion! My\nSenses are dying. My soul is crying. Let me out, let me\nOut! I'm screaming! Running blindly through the visions\nBarefoot and defenseless. Running blindly through the\nDark, infested woods. Time and time again. Disillusion\nI'm deeper in the maze. Further from the light. I scream\nOut of the confusion. I'm being consumed by confusion. My\n\nWorld has been shattered. Crippled. All we have left is\nFragments of doors. Though we once had but never had\nWe've all been fooled. Confusion. My senses are dying my\nSoul is crying. Let me out. Let me out. I'm screaming\nI'm living in a demented labyrinth. tortured. Lost\nCrippled. I'm a part of this confusion. Shattered\nConfusion. Shattered vision. All that I have left is\nIllusion. I'm screaming at the confusion. I'm being\nConsumed by confusion. In an abstract, in a world of\nConfusion!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/263743633b6e58854e753b25dca6beab.430x430x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
