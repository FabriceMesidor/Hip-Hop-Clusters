Verdy rollin' dirty\nWardrobe clean, that's just detergent, got your girlfriend pickin' purses\nSay she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person\nWhen she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses\n\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nIt's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone\nShe wanna be grown, we gon' get it on\nShe said that she lonely 'cause he's never around\nSaid she like my style, he can lay it down\nSay he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up\nSay he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nYour girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me\nYou at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument\nGucci Mane be doggin' it, beatin' her down straight poundin' it\nDrillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat\nWay baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack\nGucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that\nSweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that\nPornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet\nOne hour not finished yet, never been a minute man\nAlways been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man\nGot a man? Oh really, ma'am? Actin' like I give a damn\nUsed to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span\n\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nIt's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone\nShe wanna be grown, we gon' get it on\nShe said that she lonely 'cause he's never around\nSaid she like my style, he can lay it down\nSay he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up\nSay he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down\n\n[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]\nGucci, Trey Songz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform\nShe say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong\nShe so hot, too hot to touch, to feel it, too much for lames\nGucci Mane, I'm extra clean, so extra rubbers on my brain\nGot your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it\nWish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'\nLay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it\nBeat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa\nFreakin' partners probably never bother with a second option\nHoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'\nFreakin' partners probably never bother with a second option\nHoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'\n\n[Chorus: Trey Songz]\nIt's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone\nShe wanna be grown, we gon' get it on\nShe said that she lonely 'cause he's never around\nSaid she like my style, he can lay it down\nSay he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up\nSay he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up\nI'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1e86882e49586297dcbe8c6885a8b32.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
