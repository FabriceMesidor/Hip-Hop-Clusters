Fed up with life and the way things are going (I'm going fucking insane), he decides to rob a liquor store (I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more, homes). But on his way in he has a sudden change of heart (Shit is mine), and suddenly (I gotta do this) his conscience comes into play (I gotta do this).\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre, & Eddie]\nAlright, stop (Uh?), now before you walk in the door\nOf this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer\nYou better think of the consequence\n(Who are you?) I'm your mo{therfuckin'} conscience!\nThat's nonsense! Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs\nAnd borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs (Can I borrow this?)\nTell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days\nIf you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades\nYeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to\nThe whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you\nThink about it before you walk in the door first\nLook at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns\nBump that, do that {shit}! Hit that lick!\nCan you afford to blow this hit, are you that rich?\nWhy'd you care if you scare her to death? Are you that chick?\nDo you really think she gives {a fuck} if you have kids?\nMan, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)\nNot over this lick (Stop!), drop the biscuit (I will!)\nDon't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you\nYou know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nThese voices, these voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow\nI'll follow, I'll follow all these voices\nThese voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow\nI'll follow, I'll follow all these\n\n[Interlude: Mark Avery]\nMeet Stan, 21 years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom. Once again, his conscience comes into play.\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nNow listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek\nAnd smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink\nNow all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe\nYo, this girl's only fifteen years old\nHow could you take advantage of her? She's passed out\nIt's easy, just cut these lights out, that's how\nThen pick this chicken up, get her off Brad's couch\nAnd leave her on the front porch in her mom and dad's house\nMan, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?\nNo, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest (Doobiest)\nD'you wanna get hauled off to jail?\nBump that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nThese voices, these voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow\nI'll follow, I'll follow all these voices\nThese voices, I hear them\nAnd when they talk, I'll follow, I'll follow\nI'll follow, I'll follow all these\n\n[Interlude: Mark Avery]\nMeet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man.\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nAlright, calm down, relax, start breathin'\nStart breathin', man? You just caught your wife cheatin'\nWhile you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off\nForget gettin' divorced, cut this chicken's head off!\nWait, what if there's a good explanation for this?\nWhat, she tripped, fell, landed on his {dick}?\nAlright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\nOkay, thought about it? Still wanna grab her?\nKick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?\n(What you say?) What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?\n(I'ma kill you, you little m{otherfucker}!) Huh-uh, temper, temper\nMr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK\nComin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way\nHow in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that\n{Aw, fuck it,} what am I sayin'?\n{Do 'em both, Grady! Where's your gun at?}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b516835153051ed9e6ec085f73621663.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
