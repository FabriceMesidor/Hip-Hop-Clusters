Tell me if you move, in my groove\nWould you do what I ask you to?\nSee I love to make you moan your erogenous zone\nAny a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home\nThough your hurtin' I can feel your pain\nTry to understand, we ain't all the same\nLet me take you away, can you leave\nSome place, to find true peace?\nLet me be your lover, a positive figure\nTake your mind off the times of fucking with the wrong nigga\n\n[Hook]\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't breathe, believe when times are low\nIt's like agony when I'm at home\nHeart beatin' at a fast rate\nMakin' moves in the nude\nI imagine it's the moves that your ass make\nDon't be shy, I can't lie\nPictures of me, inside you, want it so bad I could die\nI've been possessed, so obsessed to undress you\nNo disrespect, but my aim is to sex you\nAfter that live your life as my wife at times\nYou'll understand how I had to live my life of crimes\nCome let me put my hands on your hips and move\nWith your hairdo bobbin' as we flip the mood\nGive me good lovin', time to please\nIn and out, up and down as we grind and freeze\nPut your back in the the motion and caress a figure\nMake her ashamed for fucking with the wrong nigga\n\n[Hook]\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' me a good taste\nOf the thang's I've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' me a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' me a good taste\nOf the thang's I've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' me a good taste\nOf the thang's I've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin' in the strangest positions\nGivin' you a good taste\nOf the thang's you've been missin'\nUh\nTongue kissin'\n(Oh don't move, right there)\nUh, tongue kissin'\n(Yeah)\nTongue kissin'\nTongue kissin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
