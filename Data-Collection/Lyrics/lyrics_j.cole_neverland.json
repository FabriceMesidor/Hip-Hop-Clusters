Cole]\nI\u2019m sortin through this\nOrganized confusion to get my thoughts together\nThis shit is soundin like a movie you can watch forever\nI got to make it to the top, its either now or never\nThese other niggas can't adapt because they're not as clever\nThe shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt it's better\nShe let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter?\nCole World, snow flurries in the hottest weather\nAnd so sick they can\u2019t fix this with modern medicine\nWe at your door and she's got to let us in\nIt\u2019s what you want, I whet your appetite\nCole hit the scene now I\u2019m what everyone rapping like\nShame you feel you have to bite\nStill ain't nobody snapping right\nPedal to the metal as I\u2019m speeding through the traffic lights\nBitch I got to catch a flight, come on already\nStill fight like I\u2019m the underdog, I\u2019m on already\nGot a few niggas we about to prove wrong, yall already already", "image": "https://images.genius.com/305d79b43fb5a9df37794d76ec0bb1dd.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
