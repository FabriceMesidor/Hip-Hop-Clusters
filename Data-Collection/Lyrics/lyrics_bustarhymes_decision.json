Blige]\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nWell, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'\nEven though we probably link up every now and then\nWith minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend\nSomething I realize is that I don't even have to mention\nIs whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question\nSometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me\nAnd some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately\nSee you was here, when it started to haywire\nYou're still here, walking with me going through the fire\nAnd I really love you for it, I know you all relate too\nOn everything that I believe and I appreciate you\nAnd just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name\nThe way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same\nSometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out\nBut I thank you for just being there and for hearing me out\nI got a clearer view\nI thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm gon' to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nEverything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nI look in your eye and I see the pain in it\nLife's a game, maybe the game did it\nI know I changed, they say the fame did it\nLife has changed, maybe the game did it\nTwo friends, now in two different places\nAnd the mister catching planes, and you catching cases\nFriendship, we never based it on position\nNo matter the game, we both shared the same vision\nDecisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us\nI would come to town and never get up, with you\nAround then, things weren't so simple\nI had my own issues that I was trying to get through\nOutside chatter, messing with our mental\nOn the chase of funds, trust, you can't forget to\nIt's the real friends, that you've got to tend to\nNo matter how far, just know that I'm with you\n\n[John Legend & Jamie Foxx]\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything will be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/39d2d4f1bba15212af6b346af49c7ff2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
