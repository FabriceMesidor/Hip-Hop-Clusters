I been knowin'\nFingernails and knuckles, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout\nIf you don't know then you don't know what you talkin' 'bout\nThe hazards on, the caution's out, no walkin' out\n\n[Hook]\nFrom the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs\nFrom the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue\nFrom a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums\nFrom the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun\nFrom the bottom of my heart and the top of my lugs\nFrom the roof of my mouth to the bottom of my tongue\nFrom a pimp's penthouse to the bottom of the slums\nFrom the bottom of my clip to the top of my gun", "image": "https://images.genius.com/88d2dd4ef21ac66b050a5f7fae13a350.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
