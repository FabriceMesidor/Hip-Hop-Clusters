These accolades that's meant for we?\nIt's only truth that this shit was meant to be, T.D.E\n\n[Hook: Ab-Soul & JaVonte]\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Life is still a Traffic Jam)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Ready to go)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam (Still ready to go)\nLife's still a Traffic Jam\nLife's still a Traffic Jam...\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nShit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower\nFor the most part, we go hard for the respect\nI'm obviously ominous to my competition\nAnd if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!\nWe shared our life with you\nShared our light with you even in the darkest of hours\nIn hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours\nHa, and now they look up to us like towers\nFor rhyming like we had super powers\nThey should've never let us in these offices...\nKnowing good and God-damn well\nHow well we've been ducking officers\nLaughing at the scraps they offered us in the past\nAnd now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!\nI had my ups and downs, but I always left right\nRest In Peace Alori Joh... TopDawg for life!\nAnd oh yeah... SOUL!\n\n[Interlude]\nI watch that fire that we're gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/077bbd628ad3b7383f095afde8670b76.560x560x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
