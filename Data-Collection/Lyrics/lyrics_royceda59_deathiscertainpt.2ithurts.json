She won't get it\nAll she understands is the boy that she raised just might\nDie in a hospital bed fightin' for his life\nI'm prayin', standin' over you\nLookin' at you hooked up to a machine, holdin' your hand, sayin'\n\n[Pre-Hook: Ingrid Smalls]\nDon't you go nowhere\nStay here with me\n'Cause if you leave me\nIt hurts so bad\n\n[Hook]\nDeath is certainly gon' catch you\nWhoever special to you will be left hurt\nThis is the cold, harshness of life\nJust when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life\n\n[Collision: Ingrid Smalls]\nThey can take me\nI'll take your place\n'Cause it hurts so bad\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou tearin' our team apart\nThough time heals all of our wounds, it's still leavin' a mark\nI took it too far; the feelin' that's hidden deep in my heart\nComes out when I look at the scar\nAnd I can't kill nobody to get you back\nNigga that's somethin' that time can't heal\nWhile I'm sayin' my grace, I'll be lookin' up at the sky\nAnd tellin' God that he's makin' a mistake\nYou can't take away one brother and leave the rest of the clique\nLord please, double check your list\nAnd if you get to his name and it's a check beside it\nDeath comes in threes, take me next\nBut don't make me sweat, please, I won't make it\nI get restless speculatin'\nSons should bury mothers\nEvery mother don't wanna bury her son, they sayin'\n\n[Pre-Hook: Ingrid Smalls]\nDon't you go nowhere\nStay here with me\n'Cause if you leave me\nIt hurts so bad\n\n[Hook]\nDeath is certainly gon' catch you\nWhoever special to you will be left hurt\nThis is the cold, harshness of life\nJust when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life\nDeath is certainly gon' catch you\nWhoever special to you will be left hurt\nThis is the cold, harshness of life\nJust when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life\n\n[Collision: Ingrid Smalls]\nThey can take me\nI'll take your place\n'Cause it hurts so bad\n\n[Verse 3]\nDeath is not no option\nI'm pullin' money outta my pocket, tryna con the doctor\nPlease, treat this thug the way you would treat your baby\nThe way that you would treat yo' blood, I'll pay!\nAs heavyweight as we are, I know how you medics are\n'Cause I be checkin' ER everyday\nI know we are a hairful, but doc\nThis ain't one of them that came through shot\nThat shoulda been careful\n'Cause no dude could bleed; the way his heart pumps\nMore than any patient that rode through that you seen\nThe reason that he's my man\n'Cause I tell him if he can hear me to squeeze my hand\nAnd he squeezes, so I tell him some things\nDon't let them machines help you breathe\nDon't leave from receivin'\n'Round quarter to eight, his moms is sleepin'\nHis grip weakens, his squiggly lines go straight\nCall the doctor, \"Give him all you got! Shock him!\"\nHe gon' tell you it's too late\nCall the doctor, \"Give him all you got! Shock him!\"\nIt's too late\n\n[Pre-Hook: Ingrid Smalls]\nDon't you go nowhere\nStay here with me\n'Cause if you leave me\nIt hurts so bad\n\n[Hook]\nDeath is certainly gon' catch you\nWhoever special to you will be left hurt\nThis is the cold, harshness of life\nJust when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life\nDeath is certainly gon' catch you\nWhoever special to you will be left hurt\nThis is the cold, harshness of life\nJust when it unfolds, you lucky to grow old, life\nAnd death\n\n[Collision: Ingrid Smalls]\nThey can take me\nI'll take your place\n'Cause it hurts so bad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2e15d971471dc5a14cf09f1d638b3456.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
