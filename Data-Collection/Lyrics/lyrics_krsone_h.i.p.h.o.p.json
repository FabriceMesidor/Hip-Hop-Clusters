You can't be thinkin about Billboard\nWith the mic cord, and several thousand people just bored\nBeing dope live is like being insured for life\nYou always get called back twice, you are\n\nChorus 2X\n\nVerse Three: Thor-El, KRS-One\n\nI burn like hy-dra-cho-loric and my city got itty\nHe's terrible, Thor-El's incredible and terrific\nIs it, that you're under the influence of local obvious\nRappers that die, but why, explain the obvious\n\nNo stoppin this lyrics from the esophagus\nRockin strictly the hip-hop populace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d8a06de1f39a224dcb05e3e9195e0b4.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
