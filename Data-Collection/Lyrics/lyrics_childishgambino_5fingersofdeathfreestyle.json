Childish Gambino, let's go\n\n[Verse 1]\nAs the world's turnin', I feel like I'm a worse person\nMy tongue's hurtin', from all of its work cursin'\nAnd I'm not certain I think my father's Lavar Burton\n'Til I'm walkin' in circles and I'm talkin' in third person\nIn the eighth grade I got high off paper mach\u00e9\nI put it in my desk and I let it ferment a day\nCause shit, ain't nothin' changed\nI'm still known as a rude student\nThat'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shootin'\nI can prove it\nI'm too cool as a matter of fact\nI've been writin' these verses while I'm havin' a heart attack\nI'm in your bedroom, crankin' No Doubt and Staring Back\nStereo blaring, Gwen Stefani can holla black\nI'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin\nAt a Klan rally, wondering why they won't let me in\nI'm drunk off this gin and I'm high off Ritalin\nFuck it, let me get to the next beat\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the nerdiest rapper ever\nI'm wearing a Cosby sweater\nAnd reading Oscar Wilde\nRipping my foreskin to make a washable condom\nA bunch of assassins tried to jump me\nThey couldn't touch me\nI rolled off in a yellow Humvee with a bunch of monkeys\nMy taste buds hate fudge, man\nPlus I'm allergic\nI'mma dress up like a surgeon so I could hurt Curtis on purpose\nAnd girls see my dick size and they realize\nThat they can't handle it\nI get more sodomy than Tommy Lee and Pam... Anderson?\nWith my du-rag in my left hand\nAnd my iPod and my diskman\nI get more kicks out of it than Jean Claude Van Damm\nAnd I'm still spittin', I'm still hittin'\nBig pimpin' like Hova\nYo, let me be the rap...run over\nYea, lemme go, lemme go\n\n[Verse 3]\nChildish Gambino, yo this off the dome\nI gotta keep it goin' cause I came from home\nCome from Rome, Athens\nOr Atlanta, Georgia\nGot somethin' for ya\nYes I got some s'mores cause I'll boil you\nLike I got that Goya\nYou know how they play Reggaeton in the beats\nWhen you in NYC\nMeaning that me and I'm sickest\nYo, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters Like Ickis\nYo, this chick that I used to lick it\nNow her name Aubrey Plaza\nI didn't mean to kick it while I'm gettin' salsa\nLike I'm eatin' salsa, cause she Puerto Rican\nSome people speakin' like she ain't white\nBut you know that's alright 'cause I keep it tight\n\n[Verse 4]\nNerdy word murderer in a purple convertiber\nNiggas ain't heard of him until his girlfriend converted him\nBitch niggas is Ferguson, I guess I could explain it all\nLike all these niggas wanna bone cause you datin' dogs\nOr why the radio used to not play me\nAnd why does every white girl love ukelele?\nWhere I'm from, the Jesus piece couldn't save me\nAnd I'm still spittin' shit cause I'm gettin' like gravy\nEatin' like mashed potatoes, I hate those\nHaters who say that I'm not black enough\nYo, you ain't wack enough to fuckin' touch my MC mic\nYou better keep it tight\nEat a dick like you starvin' homie\n\n[Verse 5]\nYo, on this last beat I'mma goner\nGotta spit over somethin' hard, like Nirvana\nAnd I'm crazy\nWith the beat when it comes to this spittin' it\nShittin' it, while I'm lickin' it\nI ain't even need to get it\nMan these other unC's, they need to get it\nWhy this LL Cool J shit\nYo I got pesos and mesos\nMeaning I can only hack with they ghost\nWhen they go there, when I go back\nAnd I'm still that, I ain't backpack\nBut you know, with the fuck the rest\nYo they say that is lame like Johnye West\nOr Kanye West\nBut I ain't Kanye West\nI'm just tryin' to stay the truth\nAnd I ain't tryin' to spit the truth\nYo, I do what I gotta do in a booth with Sway\nShay45 all day, y'all know what I'm sayin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a9c598da4e86fefcb845cbbe74706aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
