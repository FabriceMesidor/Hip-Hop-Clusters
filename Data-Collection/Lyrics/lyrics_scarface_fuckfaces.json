Short, check this\nJust got through fucking this bitch\nWho swallowed my cum and drunk my piss\nI stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or move it\nSucking and fucking, mayne, she loved to do it\nI bust 4, 5, 6, nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house\nI know that's my bitch, and she don't tell nobody shit\nShe keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine\nAnd because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all the time\nI'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side\nGirl so fine niggas, dreamed they fucked her and lied\nBut I'm numero uno, the one and only\nBitch be all on me, chewing my nuts like bologna\nThen click, she licked on my dick like plop\nThen nut skeeted out like thick white snot\nShe saw it was still hard and said \"Look what I got\"\nThen rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock\nTried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen\nI guess a dick that's hard and rock is what these hoes be missing\nAnd in return, she used a stolen credit card to by me cases\nAnd later on she get this bone and gives me fuck faces\n\n[Chorus: Devin the Dude]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me you hoes will never change\nSo all that's left is for us to exchange\n\n{Verse 4: Tela}\nI got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces\nSaying it's about six or seven dime pieces\nWe can hook up with no chains and no leashes\nTied to this fucking affair and slow leases\nSee what we gon' do is fall through with crushed ice\nMan, these hoes been talking 'bout fucking for three Nights\nWhole damn grill so slick, it's kind of nice\nNot too expensive, but comfortable and it's quiet\nThe Remy that she give me, and feel me, it's tranquilized\nThinking to myself at this time and realized\nShe ain't got on panties, so damn me, it's in the signs\nSomebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise\nEnter the room with the cat-ass eyes\nRochelle who do nails with them thick ass thighs\nSee, I love these kind 'cause they ain't with that bullshit\nGet a nigga off in the room and pull shit\nGirl, stop licking right there, you killing me\nGo ahead and touch it right there and feel the P\nThis some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me sit through\nDamn hoe, I must admit, that's why I dig you\nSo I put you to the world of forgotten fuck faces\nYou getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex chases\n\nYou know what I'm saying, baby? It's either now or never\nToo $hort, Tela, Devin, Scarface in style\n\n[Chorus: Devin the Dude]\nYou must be used to all the finer things\nInfatuated by what money brings\nIt seems to me you hoes will never change\nSo all that's left is for us to exchange\n\nYou must be used to all the finer things...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8f2e242e8c32bb311fdcab8c0ef63ab3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
