Too beautiful to let you sleep\nYou're my sunshine\"\n\n[Hook]\nYou're my sunshine\nYou're my moonlight\nYou're the starry skies above me\nWon't you please come down and hug me\nThink I found love in this club tonight\n\n[Verse 3]\nRelationship is just thirty minutes long\nIt's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong\nGonna take much more than once\nCan't trust what each of us say at least for a month\nOr two, before I bid you adieu\nDo this one thing for me: out of the trillions\nOf numbers that's in the world just leave me a few\nThat lead to you\nWon't be long then, I'll see you in the morning\nCool?\n\n[Hook]\nYou're my sunshine\nYou're my moonlight\nYou're the starry skies above me\nWon't you please come down and hug me\nThink I found love in this club tonight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/373c57c9cfddd95f1d232784084809ba.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
