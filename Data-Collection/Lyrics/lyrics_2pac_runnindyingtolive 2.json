And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast\n\n[The Notorious B.I.G.]\nI was more shocked than anything\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nBut I wasn't more shocked of him dying\nI was more shocked of him\u2026 Pac is a strong dude, yo\nI know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong\nSo when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, \"Again?\" you know what I'm sayin'?\nHe always getting shot, or shot at\nHe going to pull through this one again\nMake a few records about it, and it's going to be over\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nBut when he, when he died, I was just like, \"whoa\", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by\nI mean, even though we was going through our drama\nI would never wish death on nobody\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nBecause there ain't no coming back from that", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6257fe15b02c727932e884339c27b0a5.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
