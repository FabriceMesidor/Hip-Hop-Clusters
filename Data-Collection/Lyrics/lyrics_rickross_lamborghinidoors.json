Real nigga, roger that\nSaid I took a loss but I got it back, woo\nMe and all my dogs sell a lot of that food\nTalkin' to the law, knowin' that it's not cool\nMake me shoot a rapper like my name was Benny Boom\nStarted out with nothin', now a nigga in a room\nSweepin' rich bitches off they feet like a broom\nDouble-M G, bitch, you know how we move\nWhole lot of choppers, nigga, I could never lose\n\n[Interlude: Anthony Hamilton]\nI was amazed\nOh how it turned their heads\nI mastered the game\nOh how they raised their hands\nLike Lamborghini doors\nWe, we're going up\nWe, we're going up\nWe, we're going up, oh so high\nLike Lamborghini doors\nWe, we're going up\nWe, we're going up (So high)\nWe, we're going up, oh so high\nLike Lamborghini doors (Maybach Music)\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nUh, paintings on the wall, you never know the cost\nYou bangin' on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse\nI'm steppin' through the door, my back against the wall\nMy pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall\nLove to see a pretty bitch rollin' a wood leaf\nPhone ringin', smilin' like I got some gold teeth\nI caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese\nI left a chick out in DC out on the NorthEast (Trel!)\nSuch a feelin', niggas killin' for my poetry (boss)\nTryna go back underground, that's once they notice me (boss)\nI'm really not the one you wanna handle funny (never)\nAt the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him\nYou niggas out of style with your weddin' vows\nI still be makin' rounds like I'm Kevin Liles (what up)\nTime to set a date for trial, we never settle out (bring it)\nThem Lamborghini doors, you see me steppin' out\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nStarted off poor with plans to own more\nTo ridin' under stars, the life we lived for\nDreamin' of things we can't afford\nBut now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh\nThey gon' love me, they gon' love me now\nI bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah\nI bet they say, \"He put his niggas on\"\nNow we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d1373df4002267ed5d5750cb5b473c41.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
