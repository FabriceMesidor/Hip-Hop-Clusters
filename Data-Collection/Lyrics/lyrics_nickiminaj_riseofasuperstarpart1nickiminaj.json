What's hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top\n\nTo become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers \u2013 because, let\u2019s face it, how can someone be labeled a \u201csuperstar\u201d without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists?\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that \u2013 superstar\n\nWe all know the backstory \u2013 Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School (not because of her rapping, but acting), and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne\u2019s Young Money label\n\nDuring the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the \u201cFirst Lady of Young Money\u201d. After some persuasion, as well as a $5 million dollar signing-bonus, his dream became a reality\n\nThat following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album, \u201cPink Friday\u201d, a superstar began to emerge\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s so ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for Nicki Minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isn\u2019t even the biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star\n\nThe real hurdle in her way, and one that has caused problems for many female rappers of this past decade, was making a name for herself in the male-driven and male-dominated world that is rap\n\nWith a large amount of guest appearances to her name \u2013 including being featured on songs by hip hop heavyweights Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Beyonc\u00e9 and on songs by pop icons Mariah Carey, Madonna, and Britney Spears \u2013 Nicki made a name for herself by outshining her more-established peers on their own songs\n\nAs the most successful commercial female rapper of all-time, Nicki also proved that she could compete for airplay on Top 40 radio with smash hits like \u201cSuperbass\u201d, \u201cStarships\u201d, and \u201cMoment For Life\u201d. No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres\n\nNow, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop\u2019s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals\n\nIf that\u2019s not the power of a superstar, then I don\u2019t know what is", "image": "https://images.genius.com/361fbb0a68e9287bdc9eb1ad1f8099a7.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
