I don't know what to think\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd said: \"Marry me Juliet\nYou'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story baby just say 'yes'\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\nBecause we were both young when I first saw you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a9bc685bb64e29c0766374245195319e.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taylor Swift"}
