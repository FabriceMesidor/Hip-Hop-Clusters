I'm killa clownin'\nMeaning I don't give a fuck about nothing you say that you do\nBecause stupid is how everybody sounded\nNigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me\nHomie, you would leave me by my lonely\nI'm thinking death and destruction\nImages of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble\nThinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging\n(That's just the devil, just the devil)\nBlock it out and keep it moving\nI'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing\nGimme the bible, yes I need it cause Tecca Nina's in ruin\nMentally I'm fuckin up when I really don't know what I'm doin'\nMy tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly\nI'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me\nThe holy father must have flipped and became mad at me\nBecause I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy\nHow to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)\nAny sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)\nYou don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall\nThe taste of blood on my tongue makin me want to brawl\nNo sentimental shit, death is the penalty\nFor any bitch you try to re-kindle this\nIt'll get your temple hit\nBout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get\nSend it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit\nSo teeter totter mothafucka if you want it\nBut just keep it to the left of me, crazy til the death of me\nPussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe\nHaving hella drama for Nina is a necessity\nGood and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee\nShit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me\nBitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me\nI'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me\n\n[Verse 2: Mr. Reese]\nBetta load up your drums\nLoad up your guns\nEverybody better get to runnin'\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm a lyrical cynical rippin' ya pinnacle\nDamage anybody when I see they really want it with me\nTecha-ninna told me nigga get money\nAnd never been dumby\nShit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me\nFollow the beat follow your feet\nGimme the weed keys G's\nAnd a quarter pound of bullets with a machete\nMister Reese known for getting it poppin\nYou niggas be droppin'\nAnd when you do your albums be floppin\nWhen ever I spit it\nMan better yet when ever I drop it\nYour wifies gone cop it\nShe even tell you nigga go cop it\nYou don't want it with me\nI'll fuck your life up like a disease\nI'm hauntin your dreams\nWith a fully auto choppa them beams\nMayne yadadamean\nYa life ain't shit but a dream\nSo just remember when your breathin' you don't want it with me\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me\n\n[Verse 3: Prozak]\nAnd you don't want it from me\nSee I'm believing that people are really angels and demons\nInstead of human beings\nI'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding\nCausin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving\nEntered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles\nKeep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles\nI'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows\nAs I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles\nMy eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums\nIt's time to hit the streets with guns\nI'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run\nI plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done\nUntil the pain coincides with my violence and agony\nOh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me\nBut it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds\nThe Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)\nMake it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)\nIf you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)\nCause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)\nAnd I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it\nOne of us ain't gonna make it out\nYou don't want it with me\nI'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael\nPush it you'll see what I'm talking bout\nYou don't want it with me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d568b86ce102e78c9c49f201c1a48234.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
