Picture yourself going out as a hero\nPicture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners\nFans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners\nNotorious tried to warn us\nWe watched, so many piggybacked off of\nBiggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap\nStatistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact\nThese tragic events, which lead us back\nTo where we left off on March 9th\nTo come from such hard knock lives\nAnd make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights\nAnd, once they're on us this is our lives\nThrust out for all eyes to cast upon us\nTo see who can last the longest\nAnd he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest\nIn this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from\nIt's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving\nOr it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies\nAnd applies to his persona or the sizes\nIn his entou-rage, that intimidates the people\nTo the point that you know that he's gangster\nHe ain't just say shit, you just believe it\n\n[Verse 2: Obie Trice]\nSince B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big\nI'm been about my business since then, so anxious\nIt ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn\nThis I took in, sent chills through my skin\nVicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him\nIt's what excited Obie to write these poems\nRolling, going through the same shit he spoken\nOpen up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies\nWhen Ready to Die was a sick part of my life\nPalming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind\nThen that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind\nGot me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind\nGet up out the system, who could give him better signs\nNo pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes\nSo possibly I'd be popular, huh?\nThat's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I\n\n[Verse 3: Diddy]\nI took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind\nEnter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time\nI made a Frankenstein, my design impressed\nBackpackers and press who said my house was a mess\nCritics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing\nAll I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion\nAnd I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is\nThe original king of New York, Christopher Wallace\nThis is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna\nAnd teach her that with all the drama don't even bother\nOn repeat, all of your albums play back to back\nAnd I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact\nAn immaculate concept, extravagant progress\nBullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling \"God bless\"\nRegardless to critics yelling that East/West\nI seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset\nAnd when the resurrection of you shines through an individual\nLyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally\nI'mma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest\nWhether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09b1732dbce927085a1fca7538fc1bb3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
