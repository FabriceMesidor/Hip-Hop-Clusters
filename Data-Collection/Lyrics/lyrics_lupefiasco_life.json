Life\n[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]\nFrom city to city, I really did it for y'all\nFrom the itty bitty small, to the really really tall\nWhere they paw, and they living in a shelter\nBegging with their kids, they're too helpless to help her\nIf you walk in trailer park today\nOr a park where the ground is too harsh to lay\nOr the projects where there's no park to play\nAnd it's too dark to read\nAnd you're too marked to leave\nWhere wick only buys juicy juice and kicks\nIt's a trip because the youth is usually used to this\nAnd that's strength\nAnd you gotta be strong\nWhen the dramas on your back\nAnd your clothes don't match\nAnd your father is gone\nAnd on top of all that\nThe water isn't on\nAnd your dishes don't match\nThe teachers say they only come to school to flunk\nBut there's some that only go to school for lunch\nAnd that's life\n\n[Hook]\n\nThis one goes out to all of the children\nHanging out of them buildings\nWhile they just watching the asphalt grow\nNow some of them got bright futures\nAnd some will never know\nBecause they say it's a miracle\nIf we live to see 24\nThis is for them babies with no fathers\nFor the people that's starving\nLiving out here on these streets\nTo that man that's working too hard\nJust to feed his family\nWorking 2 and 3 jobs\nAin't got time for play at all\nThis is his life\n\n[Children Singing]\n\nThis is for my people out there hustling\nTo the family that's struggling\nLiving from paycheck to paycheck\n?\nThe baby needs a pair of shoes\nAnd on top of all that\nWe've got to deal with self-esteem issues\nThis is for the ones that go and tell\nThey say no matter what you do\nMoney can't buy you happiness\nAnd this is for all we've sacrificed\nFor all of the pains\nFor everyday we cry\nWe just have to keep living our life!\n\n[Children Singing]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
