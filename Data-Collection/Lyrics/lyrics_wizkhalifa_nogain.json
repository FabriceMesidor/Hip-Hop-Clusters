They say nothin'\nWhere they goin'? They say nothin'\nCall my phone, it ain't nothin'\nI smoke a lot, but don't judge me\nProlly wake up earlier than all of you niggas\nMafuckas always hate on the squad\nBut all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin ain't get paid\n\n[Chorus]\nMan, I work hard\nMan, I work hard (fuck!)\nMan, I work hard (I mean like goddamn what you want me to say?)\nMan, I work hard (it's what I do!)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nIt ain't no gain (it ain't no gain, no gain without bein' no pain)\nNo pain\nMan, I work hard", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc518c4d4e7c42fd3eb6b8a0683c0e63.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
