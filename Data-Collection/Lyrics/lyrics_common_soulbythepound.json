If you straight, then I'm straight\nRock me tonight, just for old time's sake\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack to our regularly scheduled program, program\nI am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam\nLike Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian\nCause see I want it quiet in here...\nI Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases\nPlay like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises\nTo stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors\nI'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nFor a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold\nAnd reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male\nAnd I can't tell, why for a ho you grow a tail\nAnd stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell\nAin't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid\nShit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid\nGot doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass\nIf I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache\nI must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black\nIt's like McDonald's sellin fatback\nGet back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks\nI'm hearin rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks\nYou're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter\nWhen we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer\nI'mma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups\nRhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops\nI'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far\nI feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R\nOr whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles\nBut you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker\nThink of that boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta\nIs stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk\nIf soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk\nIf if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff\nIt's not a myth about our dick width\nI'm swift and I shoot the presents\nIn essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff\nI'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL\nMy last name should be Smith-sonian\nI'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum\nGet em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian\nAnd turn off the lights this is the likes of a\nTicketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother\nGot Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter\nA chick is a chick that's how I treat her\nNever go pop I'm not a two liter\nA true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow\nWhether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto\nWear em? No, share em? A ho\nI like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro\nCause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations\nThat holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"\n\"Gimme a pound, thank you man\"\n\"Gimme a pound\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c373c33c35be2bbc253b17152ab16152.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
