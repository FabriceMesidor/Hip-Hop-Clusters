Abe Lincoln\nAnd still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin'\nThis game's built to get got while blinkin'\nRappers do big up jail like a recruiter\nLet 'em tend ta hit a boy, said he was a shooter\nTold him \"Man up, or keep it pushin' like a scooter\"\nThen said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha\nLo and behold, police shows up\nSpit his shitty sixteen and got his self froze up, up\nHis story had a moral, it's buried in the soil\nVil put it in her back like the epidural\nKids: eat, sleep, stay away from creeps\nSpit it from the heart, this game's for keeps\nSo peep\nYeah, saga of a true B-Boy\nBeware any likenesses or imagery is a decoy\nSho nuff, yo fluff, force like Bruce Leroy\nBring trouble up and get double cut\u2014 keloid\nBubble up, run 'em up, destroy\nAnd anything else you see\u2014 void\nRightful ownership\nGot a bone to pick with the phoniest colonialist\nWho own a ship\nThe loneliest known to rip\nKnown to sip pine and ripple\nFind yourself in a bind and pickle\nDon't bite the hand that feeds you, bite the nipple\nIn this land of black and brown, ain't no backin' down\nAs foul as that sound, it's hard to find a cap and gown\nBut it's always like a MAC around\nB-r-r-r-r-at!! Man down\nMetal is empowered, devil is a coward\nIt all smells of high hell like no one ever showered\nScrub behind ya ears, shed the final tears\nRemember what the world was like in the final years\nJust a speck of dirt in the universe, snap fingers\nJust like that\u2014 assume the worst\nBack in business, guzzle beers, track and fitness\nLaps get faster, could've missed Christmas\nWhat is this?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66bf9e0794dc47e2ac14146257155f41.497x498x1.png"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
