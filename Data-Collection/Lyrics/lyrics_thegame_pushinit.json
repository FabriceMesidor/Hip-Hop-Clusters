Think it was horse and carriage\nBut I ain't talkin' marriage, I'm talkin' fourteen karats\nI ain't talkin' Tiffany cause I ain't talkin' industry\nI'm talkin' in the streets, twin Bentleys\nI'm tryna be with you mentally before physically\nOr physically before mentally, just remember me\nFor you I'd let that thing like a symphony\nSid and Nancy or Mickey and Mallory we meant to be\nNever been a trick, I do the shopping for both us\nSend shots at these vultures in these Mark Jacob loafers\nI'm sayin', you gon' let me see somethin'? Stop playin'\nI didn't know it was like that goddamn\nYou bring the LL out a nigga\nThe Louis V, the Berkin and Chanel out a nigga\nJ12 out a nigga, so you know what time it is\nI'm 'bout to call the realtor, yo ma, where you tryna live\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nWhat's happenin' mommy? What you doin'? You supposed to be\nLivin' in the life of luxury so you should go with me\nI\u2019m overly excited, spend the night, I bet you like it\nDo with it whatever you like , it don't matter, just don't bite it\nYou see that feeling you had when you met me, we you shouldn't fight it\nThey said you and I or more than worth a try, so don't deny it\nSee, I'm King like Leonidas, dress your hands with the brightest\nStones known to man when your man's pockets on a diet\nBrought you in this presidential, out that double in the Hyatt\nBig money talkin', all broke niggas be quiet\nIt don't matter how he feels, all that matters how he live\nDon't listen to his opinion till he stack a couple mill\nBut until then feel free to come chill\nIn my crib in the hills sit back kick off your heels\nSaid you never seen a pad with a view so ill\nOr receive so much pleasure that you couldn't hold still\nWell until\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch\n\n[Bridge: Robin Thicke]\nStraight to the penthouse, elevate\nLet me put my hands on your w-w-wait\nLet me take a second, let me take it in\nYou can run that game all night, but you know I'll w-w-win\nI'm superman, I'm super cool\nI'm breathin' air all over you\nI'm superman, I'm super cool\nI'm breathin' air all over you\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nI let your friends talk bad about you, I didn't kn-izzo\nBehind your back callin' you a H to the izzo\nI apologize, lay your head on my pillow\nMr. and Mrs. Smith and we can have a little Willow\nShe can shave the sides, put a couple lines in it\nAnd we can have spritzers put a couple limes in it\nThrow a Bar Mitzvah put a couple dimes in it\nShe go see a Drake show but never out of line with it\nSo every chance I get, nigga I'm in it\nDeep sea divin' tryna see what I can find in it\nSo it's mine in'it, and that's a Porsche ain't it\nSo picture that and have Andy Warhol paint it\nI'm a rude boy so I'ma go and get it up\nRihanna post Chris, Matt, Kim, baby this is us\nSo talk to me, have you ever been to Cannes\nYeah, south of France, next stop Japan\nLet's go\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nPushin' it, your lips\nCause my drug is your kiss\nI'm pushin' it, your body\nYou're beautiful, vaginal\nI'm pushin' it, back door\nI wanna elevate ya to the top floor\nI'm pushin' it, need a rush\nThe way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6e47923e84d22040bd228aa550a666d4.800x800x1.png"}], "artist": "The Game"}
