Money on my mind!\"\nThen she wanna ask when it got so empty\nTell her I apologize, happened over time\nShe says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me\nIf they don't get it, they'll be over you\nThat new shit that you got is overdue\nYou better do what you supposed to do\nI'm like, \"Why I gotta be all that?\"\nBut still I can't deny the fact that it's true\nListening to you expressin' all them feelings\nSoap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children\nAnd that's who you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'\nI guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions\nYou know that they ain't even got it like that\nYou gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that\n\u2018Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that\nWhen they get my shit and play it\nI ain't even gotta say it, they know\n\n[Chorus]\nThey know, they know, they know\nThey know, they know, they know\nThey know, they know, they know\nYeah, they know, yeah\nThat the real is on the rise\nFuck them other guys\nI even gave 'em a chance to decide\nNow it's something they know\nThey know, they know, they know\n\n[Outro]\nI be yelling out \"Money over everything!\"\n\"Money on my mind!\"\nTell them I apologize, it happened over time\nThey know\nThey know, they know, they know\nThey know, they know, they know\nThey know, they know, they know\nYeah\u2026\n\n[Skit]\nI heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies\nRather hear what was or will be than what is\nRather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you\nRather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you\nRather you make this an open letter\nAbout family and struggle and it takin' forever\nAbout hearts that you\u2019ve broken and ties that you\u2019ve severed\nNo doubt in my mind, that\u2019ll make them feel better", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0f9db60edacd4ccadf1eb230c2915792.475x475x1.png"}], "artist": "Drake"}
