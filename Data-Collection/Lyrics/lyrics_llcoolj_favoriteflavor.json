Blige + (LL Cool J)]\nLike lemondrops with chocolate kisses\nEvery bite is more delicious\nMy favorite flavor\n(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)\nLike caramel on vanilla sundae\nHave a scoop you'll want some day\n'Cause you're my favorite flavor\n(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nMy flavor's unreal\nSmooth but hard like woodgrain on the wheel\nRecline your seat baby, enjoy how it feel\nWhy you crossin' your legs, them high heels of eel?\nKick off your shoes, run your toes on the dash\nNow peel off your stockings, c'mon let's get it poppin'\nI'm in the mood for cotton, candy and I'm plottin'\nTo see you in somethin' silky and see-through\nMe too! Man you know how we do\nCamcorder main feature, damn a preview\nI love how the bottom on your body's EQ\nLow but thick though like the base in a six-fo'\nSo here we go (here we go) we bunny hoppin'\nI hit the switches baby, you keep it droppin'\nIt feels marvelous, you in charge of this\nI hope you ain't heartless but my guard's down regardless\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (LL Cool J)]\nLike lemondrops with chocolate kisses\nEvery bite is more delicious\nMy favorite flavor\n(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)\nLike caramel on vanilla sundae\nHave a scoop you'll want some day\n'Cause you're my favorite flavor\n(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon\n\n[Bridge: Mary J. Blige + (LL Cool J)]\n(Uhh) All I wanna do\nIs eat you up 'cause you look so good\n(Think I look alright huh?)\n(I look better on you, what'chu really wanna do?)\nAll I wanna do\nIs show you boy that I taste good too\n(I know you taste good ma)\n(What'chu sayin', want a sprinkle of the hood ha? Ha?)\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nWe had it out\nNow tell your girls the truth when they ask what I'm about\nThe cookies and the cream and the peaches 'n praline\nButter pecan themes in your daydreams\nAll real sugar, no sacca-rhine\nLow calorie, leave no cavities\nGuaranteed no place you'd rather be\nThan here with me, mix chocolate in the factory\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (LL Cool J)]\nLike lemondrops with chocolate kisses\nEvery bite is more delicious\nMy favorite flavor\n(Mix me and you and we can't go wrong)\nLike caramel on vanilla sundae\nHave a scoop you'll want some day\n'Cause you're my favorite flavor\n(C'mon, baby baby c'mon) c'mon\n\n[Outro: Mary J. Blige]\nOh, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8f036bc91d1ae759df9acb3ca88e0c5f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
