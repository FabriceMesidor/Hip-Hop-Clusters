A high Joker like a Spades game\nCame back from five years laying and stayed the same\nI'm saying, electromagnetic field it blocks all logic, Spock\nAnd G-Shocks her biological clock\nWhen I hit it, slit it to the shitter,  thought I killed her goose\nHer Power U was pure Brita water, filtered juice\nKeep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him\nGentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him\nNever seen the shit again but he's still my dunny\nThe only thing that come between us is krill and money\n\n[Chorus]\nI sell rhymes like dimes\nThe one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times\n\n[Verse 2]\nBetter rhymes make for better songs, it matters not\nIf you got a lot of what it takes just to get along\nSurrender now or suffer serious setbacks\nGot get-back, connects wet-back, get stacks\nEven if you gots to get jet-black, head to toe\nTo get the dough, battle for bottles of Mo' or 'dro\nThis fly flow take practice like Tae Bo with Billy Blanks\n\"Oh, you're too kind!\" \"Really? Thanks!\"\nTo the gone and lost forever like \"Oh My Darling Clementine\"\nHe hold his heart when he telling rhyme\nWhen it's his time, I hope his soul go to Heaven\nHe nasty like the old time Old No. 7\nYou still taste it when you chase it with the Coca-Cola\nMake 'em wish they could erase it out the Motorola\nI told her, \"No credit for a bag\nIf you want what they got, then go get it, it's all gack\"\nOnly in America could you find a way to earn a healthy buck\nAnd still keep your attitude on self-destruct\n\n[Chorus]\nI sell rhymes like dimes\nThe one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times\n\n[Verse 3]\nJoking rhymes, like the \"Is you just happy to see me?\" trick\nClassical slapstick rappers need Chapstick\nA lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show\nSo I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo\nTally-ho!
