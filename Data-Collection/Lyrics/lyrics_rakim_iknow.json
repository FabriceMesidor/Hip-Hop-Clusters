Your wish is my command\nAnd I'm a rock a jam by popular demand\nYou gone love this, it's marvelous, baby\nIt gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy\nIt's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back\nSpeak raps and I freak tracks for these cats\nI got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters\nIt ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is\nGhetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters\nAnd still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses\nWhat I don't do is talk about the same old thing\nWhen I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing\nI bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise\nCuz the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe editor, forevermore the predator\nI set it off, spread a war like never before\nSpit literatures like a ghetto braud raw to cause ?\n'till menopause\nWith raw metaphors, I set it off\nBut I just begun the best is yet to come\nBlessed with a majestic tongue since I was young\nBut I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns\nTest the one, let Allah protect your son\nCause I'm the musical magician, the Asiatic author\nThe microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor\nYou can explore, every sentence is a tour\nThe inventor is more than adventure\nYou'll be blown away, in the zone when it play\nIt's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say\nOne of my own displays like I'm known to blaze\nAnd I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed0fa8170b1ec37192ad4e270a004891.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
