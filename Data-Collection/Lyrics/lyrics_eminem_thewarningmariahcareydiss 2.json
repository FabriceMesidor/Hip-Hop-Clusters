However you prefer to do\nAnd that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?\nYou're gonna ruin my career, you better get one\nLike I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt\nThat made me put up with her psycho ass over six months\nAnd only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah\nWhat you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly\nThat you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?\nSecond base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?\nThe second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for something\nListen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk\nAbout how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely\nAnd bust all over your belly and you almost started hurlin'\nAnd said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curlin'\nOr maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me\nI'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true\nAs long as that song's gettin' airplay I'm dissin' you\nI'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued\nI was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two\nThis is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through\nDamn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?\nOh did I say \"whore\", Nick? I meant a liar too\nLike I've been goin' off on you all this time\nFor no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind\nCheck your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine\nLike I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time\nI just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme\nBut fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line\nAnd for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb\nI can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find\nOn an episode of Cribs, I blow below the ribs\nIf I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs\n'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs\nI ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is\nIt's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot\nCall my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got\nIncludin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top\nWhen me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot\n\n[Interlude: Mariah Carey]\nSlim Shady, artful dodger\nSlim Shady, artful dodger\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem (& Mariah Carey)]\n(I love you) I love you, too\nLet me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo\nNow what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do\nIs refresh your memory when you said (I want you)\nNow should I keep goin' or should we call truce?\n(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do\n(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh\n(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you\nSo if you'll still be my (Baby girl)\nThen I'll still be your (Superhero)\n(Oh and Em?) Yeah, I'm right here\n(You like this) Nope, not anymore dear\nIt cuts like a (knife) when I tell you get a (life)\nBut I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, 'cause that's your (wife)\nWell tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone\nIf she don't (stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'\nDamn\n\n[Outro: Mariah Carey]\nI see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape\nCut the tape, knife", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c778ede6d40a1bd97f8a8cc51f006cfa.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
