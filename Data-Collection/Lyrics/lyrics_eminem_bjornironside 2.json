In this rap game\n\nAll hail your new king!\n...nope\nME!\n...nope\nKing Harald...\n...nope\nHail King Bjorn!\n...yeah!\n\n[Around that sea are many wonderful people and places and towns... I want to go there!]\n\n[With me in the name of Odin!\nNow Ragnar is dangerously ill\nIn the name of my father!\nNothing can stop us!\nAttack!]\n\nIt's like a throne that he don't even own\nHe won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around\nIt\u2019s like a joke, he\u2019s like a king, but he don\u2019t rule a thing\nHe don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry\nHe don't want the room or want the loot, he's in it for the sport\nRunning circles 'round his competition on the court\nHe appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it\nAnd you can love it, you can hate it,\u00a0but you can't ignore it\nYou can't be that ig-nor-ant,\u00a0though you can try to sell him short\nBut you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it\nAnd he was born to raise hell like them country boys\nAnd if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it\n\n[You've all come to understand how a young farmer from Norway risked his life to explore the world\nWe have achieved my father's dream. We have the legal right to the land and to farm!]\n\n[With me in the name of Odin!\nNow Ragnar is dangerously ill\nIn the name of my father!\nNothing can stop us!\nAttack!]\n\nThis is the story of a warrior, I know you know it\nTrue warriors go ahead and make some noise\nIt ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid\nHit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys\nI'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane\nKick back just relax let me do my thing\nDon't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain\nWho wants to be king?! In this rap game\n\nAll hail your new king!\n...nope\nME!\n...nope\nKing Harald...\n...nope\nHail King Bjorn!\n...yeah!\n\n[A civil war can only bring tragedy.]\n\n[With me in the name of Odin!\nNow Ragnar is dangerously ill\nIn the name of my father!\nNothing can stop us!\nAttack!]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
