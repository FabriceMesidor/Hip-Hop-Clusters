Now\nThis is our final hour\nLet me be the voice and your strength and your choice\nLet me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise\nTry to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six\n-teen million people, all equal at this high pitch\nMaybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech\nLet the President answer a higher anarchy\nStrap him with an AK-47, let him go\nFight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way\nNo more blood for oil, we got our own battles\nTo fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare\nTo trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal\nIf we don't serve our own country\nWe're patronizin' a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies\nThe stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped\nAnd replaced with his own face, mosh now or die\nIf I get sniped tonight, you'll know why\u2014\u2018cause I told you to fight!\n\n[Hook]\nCome along, follow me\nAs I lead through the darkness\nAs I provide just enough spark that we need\nTo proceed, carry on, give me hope\nGive me strength, come with me\nAnd I won't steer you wrong\nPut your faith and your trust\nAs I guide us through the fog\nTo the light at the end of the tunnel\nWe gon' fight, we gon' charge, we gon' stomp\nWe gon' march through the swamp\nWe gon' mosh through the marsh\nTake us right through the doors, come on!\n\n[Outro]\nAnd as we proceed\nTo mosh through this desert storm\nAnd these closing statements\nIf they should argue, let us beg to differ\nAs we set aside our differences\nAnd assemble our own army\nTo disarm this weapon of mass destruction\nThat we call our President, for the present\nAnd mosh for the future of our next generation\nTo speak and be heard\nMr. President! Mr. Senator!\n\n[Hailie Jade]\nCan you guys hear us?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e76120b9dd2c0af6f1b3f8d3dcbe11d2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
