No, I'm here to stay\nI'm really great, but don't discriminate\n'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face\nYou stickin' out your chest, your titties fake\nDon't make me pick your fate\nI'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced\nThe heart was built to break\nI'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake\nI got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case\nMy killers straight, let's do some Q&A\nYou saw the news today\nGot news to break and rules to break\nIt hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break\nIt's worth the wait, commercial break\n\n[Chorus: Thomas Troelsen]\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)\nOut of all the rain clouds, I was chosen\nWhen all of the lights, they get low\nAnd all of the curtains, they close\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\nWe bros (Can't be broken)\nWe bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code\n(Can't be broken)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e2d71d269b2971975d5d9ca36deb943.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
