I ain't fuckin' no groupie!\"\nShe don't believe me\nMy career is so deceiving\nShe's dating a rapper, nobody said it was gon' be easy\nShe threatening to leave me cause of these text messages girls send\nNow I'm just caught in this whirlwind\nTryna explain they just friends who can't control themselves\nThey see the fame, think I'm cute, and they get overwhelmed\nShe should fuckin' know the deal\nI'm done dealing with this bull shit\nBitch, I'm outta here, you can go to hell\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's no room to drive at the end of the road\nWhen you're living in the cold not wearing a coat\nThe breeze turns tears to snow\nWill they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me\nStop trying to reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe underground ain\u2019t been the same since I emerged from it\nNiggas hear my name and they just hate, and throw some dirt on it\nTalking 'bout I blew up and just left them in the dust\nBut we ain\u2019t friends mothafucka we ain\u2019t neva kicked it once\nYou better zip it shut, I\u2019m respectful\nBut if I spot you that\u2019s the only time that I won\u2019t ever give a fuck\nYour words can make a difference, do not forget\nIf you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it\nBitch niggas acting all macho, jealous 'cause they ain\u2019t got dough\nWhile they still won\u2019t put enough for me at my show\nSmiling coming over to me, like I\u2019m the coldest MC\nAnd then you bad mouth the moment I leave\nAight, I got it since I\u2019m in the limelight\nYou niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my hype\nSimple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed\nInsult my name you\u2019ll rekindle a flame, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's no room to drive at the end of the road\nWhen you're living in the cold not wearing a coat\nThe breeze turns tears to snow\nWill they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me\nStop trying to reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me\n\n[Verse 3]\nI\u2019m about to lock myself in my basement and dig my grave inside\nAll jokes aside, man I see no reason to stay alive\nIf I do it, I won\u2019t even say \u201cgood-bye\u201d\n\u201cYa, ho, but you\u2019re Hopsin, and you have so many fa-ans!\u201c\nYeah, great advice\nI\u2019m not lucky\nOutside of Hopsin, there's no one who loves me\nI come home to absolutely nothing\nNobody pays any mind to Marcus\nThey treat me like I\u2019m retarded\nThey just want me to slave away as an artist\nIt don\u2019t make any sense to me\nNo one wants to get to know the real me\nThey just want some pictures for they friends to see\nI deal with this kind of stress, endlessly\nFuck this damn industry\nLook at all the shit that it just did to me\nI don\u2019t care about no big collab or tryna swim in cash\nI just want a family I can watch the TV with and laugh\nUntil then, I\u2019m on the dark side\nI\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 Dark Knight, startin\u2019 bar fights\nJust a hard life\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's no room to drive at the end of the road\nWhen you're living in the cold not wearing a coat\nThe breeze turns tears to snow\nWill they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)\nDon\u2019t fucking call me\nStop trying to reach me\nI ain\u2019t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/89f3b594c1d21cb0ced76a0e54600701.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
