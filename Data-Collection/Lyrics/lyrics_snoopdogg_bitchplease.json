West Coast, Los Angeles)\nWhat\nBringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what\nThrowin' up a big ass W\nCoverin' up the world, right\nYeah, ha\nListen, look\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nYou ain't tryna hot box with me, I swig hard liquor\nGoin' down by the second round, all hail the underground\nHow that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict\nFuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit\nGlass and metal in every direction\nInnocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson\nI'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon\nAnd reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'\nXzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back\n9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?\nFor me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around\nWith the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy\nYou had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X\nStrangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex\nDrunk drivin', tryna stack my loot\nWhile other rappers gettin' \"Treated Like a Prostitute\"\nSo check the SoundScan\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nAll I wanna be was a G, ha!\nMy whole life, nigga please, ha!\nBreakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha!\nLet's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha!\nNigga, you don't wanna fuck with this\nHmm, oh no, big Snoop Dogg\nBack up in the heezy, baby\nYou jockin' my style? You so crazy\nDre say, ain't \"No Limit\" to this\nAs long as we drop gangsta shit\nLook here bitch, you fine and I dig your style\nCome fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style\nI'll be gentle, sentimental\nShit, we fucked in the rental\nLincoln Continental\nCoast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago\n\n[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]\n(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happenin', man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go\n(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know (Hell yeah)\n(Hoes know about a nigga like me, man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go\n(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha-ha) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know\n\n[Verse 3: Xzibit]\nBitch please! Get down on your god damn knees\nFor this money, chronic, clothes and weed (Look)\nLook, you fuckin' with some real O.G's, bitch please\nBitch please, get down on your motherfuckin' knees\nWe came to get the motherfuckin' cheese\nYeah, you fuckin' wit' some real OG's, you dick tease\n\n[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]\nBitch, please! Now what you need to do is\nHem my coat, and roll me some dope (Fo' real)\nDifferent strokes (Huh-uh) for different folks\nOh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?\nA cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart\nShit gets thick when the light gets dark\nShe say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up)\nWorth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!\nNow check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move\nThen a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose\nBut you know me, Dogg, I'm movin'!\nAin't nothing to it but to get to groovin'\nYou've been waitin' on a nigga like me (What's that?)\nTo take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy\nA victim of the circumstance\nThat's the devil, they always wanna dance\nSee we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)\nI'm tryin' to work this cold thang\nAnd take this whole thang\n\n[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]\nI get the money everywhere that I go (I go)\nI bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)\nI get the money everywhere that I go (I go)\nI bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)\n\n[Outro: Nate Dogg]\nAyo, ayo, ayo\nYou don't wanna step to me\nStill claiming D.P.G.
