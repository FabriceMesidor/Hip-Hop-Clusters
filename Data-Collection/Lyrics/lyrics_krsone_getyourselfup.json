( *crowd responds \"live!\" )\nRap is something you do\nHip-hop.. ( *crowd responds \"is something you live!\" )\nYou are not just doing hip-hop..\n( *crowd responds \"You are hip hop!\" )\n\nYeah\nLet's get this started\nWord up\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta - get - your - self - up\nYou been knocked down?\nGet yourself up\nYou been shot down?\nGet yourself up\nYou been locked down?\nGet yourself up\nGet - your - self - up\nBeen knocked down?\nGet yourself up\nBeen shot down?\nGet yourself up\nYou been locked down?\nGet yourself up\n\nWhat is a real hip-hop MC?\nIs it MTV?\nIs it BET?\nIs it five M-I-C's so the people can see?\nI mean, how you think you're free when you act like property?\nTell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin'?\nI mean, rockin' it live, not pickin his cotton?\nI mean, adjusting his clothes? I mean, how do you know\nBefore you come to the show that you're not gettin heated?\nThat you're not gettin cheated?\nThat you ain't come to the club thinkin', 'I must've been weeded'?\n(Word)\nYou got to be a educated consumer\nSpend your money on MC's 'cause these rappers'll do ya\nAll they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas and a flick\nWhen you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick\nBeware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter\nHe pulls his gat while we bust off the gat-ler\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThis is \"The Sneak Attack\"\nThe \"Edutainment\" style returns like that\nTake it off your shelf\n'Cause all we deal wit is knowledge of self, health and wealth\nNot Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers\nOriginal hip-hop armor on cd-rom - uh\nYou got to get with a\n21st century philosopher\nRepresentin' the religion of hip-hop sir\nThose that oppose are foes and will get rocked - uh\nStop, uh\nI rise like a helicopter\nLike Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd\nWith a beat that's loud\nHuh, I'm black and I'm proud, irrelevant\nI'm black and intelligent\nI teach my kids to watch the education they give 'em\n'Cause it's really all about street wisdom\n\n[Chorus]\n\nTrue hip-hoppers don't bleed\nTrue hip-hoppers don't need\nTrue hip-hoppers don't speed\nNo time for greed\nTrue hip-hoppers do read and will lead\nNot plead\nWill sow seeds that breed\nAh-ha that's safer than weed, indeed\nTrue hip-hoppers don't slave\nTrue hip-hoppers don't crave\nSilver and gold, we're not amazed\nWe live F-R-E-E\nIf you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me\nMy philosophy keeps it plain and simple\nHere it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you\nOr is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?\nI'm ringin a bell within you\nYou only seekin to sell\nThat's what sin do\nIt tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart\nSo they can sell you and your art\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/756508fbcbfc3c6ac80f412ee6f089bd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
