It came\nIn the form of a thug in the game\nTo create a strong position, there's blood in my vein\nThe chemical is identical, we one and the same\nWith seven letters in all three of my government names\nWalk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus\nIt's a parable to make followers and readers believers\nFrom Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left\nUnderstand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F\nI told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets\nJesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad\nI showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise\nI spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus\nLike Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal\nThe seven spirits of God when I open the seal\nInterpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you\nTranslate the Torah, and decode the Bible\nWarn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law\nThe seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance\nSkin is bronze like the Messiah\nRakim Allah's about to reveal the biggest secret in time: Men are God\n\n[Chorus]\nHoly are you\nHoly are you\nThere is no God but you\nThere is no God but you\nPraised be the Lord", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a5928958bdda95a9493e76a22eeb4be.588x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
