Wanna make a scary movie?\nRappers coming in with their team and carry toolies\nYou can jump right out of the screen and barely move me\nWe hard-hitting, directing and starring in it\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon\nHop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding\nAny man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes\nSo fast it'll look like an invisible man standing\nI'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail\nBill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale\nCause any MC that chooses to go against me\nIs getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)\nCame home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed\nScreaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes sticking outta my pant leg\nFuck a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain\nYou should be anywhere that a mic ain't\nYou rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you\nDown a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them\nIf they don't like the track, fuck them, the rap struck 'em harder\nThan getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on\nAnd any half-assed known rapper to trespass\nBetter be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch\nSo tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly\nI'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie\nI'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree\nTo stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe\nAnd when I'm down to my last breath, I'mma climb the Empire State Building\nAnd get to the last step and still have half left\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\nBad, the Bad (Uhh, when the Bad meets the Bad, yo)\nThe Evil (Take the Evil with the Evil)\nPut 'em together (What? Nine-nine)\nTwo times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b1c9568017c50ed4a1b0e810ff2a60c.480x360x1.png"}], "artist": "Bad Meets Evil"}
