I don't know, I wasn't sleepin' that long\nWhen i woke up (What happened brotha?)\nMy microphone was gone\nFirst I panicked (how?)\nI put the cops on the case\nBut they was stumped (damn)\nWithout a clue or a trace\nSo as sure as smokin' cigarettes is bad for your health\nIf I want my microphone back I'll find it myself\nSo I picked up the phone (For what?)\nI called Dizzy (What's up?)\nMy mic's gone (Word?)\nLet's get busy!\nBefore I told Dizzy what I wanted to do\nHe was over at my house with the TMS crew\nHe said (Word is out on every mouth on the street\nNow that its gone, its not long 'til you're beat)\nAnd then it hit me (Damn)\nI got a battle at six\nWithout my microphone\nI'm guaranteed to get whipped\nYa might think it's unbelievable\nBut word to the strength\nWhen it comes to rockin' rhymes\nI'm a musical nymph\nThey gave me other mics\nBut yo, it wasn't no use\nI tried to rock it (One-two one-two)\nBut I couldn't get loose\nI said forget it\nWith microphone or not, I gotta do it\nGive it all that I got (Yo, what if ya lose?)\nIt'd be the first time I lost\nBut if I beat 'em, it'd finally prove that I'm the boss\nI grabbed my leather jacket\nWalked through the streets\nWas hopin' and prayin'\nStrictly Dope won't get beat\nI begin to get hyped; I was ready to fight\nYo, I was confident that I went\nTo hell with the mic!\nI hop on to the stage\nDizzy started the beat\nThe sucka' shivered\nBecause he tasted defeat\nThen I signaled to Dizzy and\nBust a rhyme with my head\nPerpetrator fell back (Ha!)\nAnd then he was dead\nI was happy as hell\nCause I was lucky that night\nPut my hand in my pocket\nAnd there was my mic\nHaha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e142d133ba86fd5bdc94a72f198e2e5.375x376x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
