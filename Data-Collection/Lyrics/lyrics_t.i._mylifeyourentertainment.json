Talking]\nHey, hey\nHey what's happenin' e'erybody\nI hope they get my good side\nYou know I gotta look good when I walk out the house\nYou know I know the camera's following\nI know they taking pictures, right Drama\nAy man, you watch it I live it, you dig that?\nY'all sit back relax get some popcorn man\nI'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that\nThis goin' make a hell of a movie huh!\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nThe price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave\nE'erything in my possession for my seconds on the stage\nFor my name up in lights and multi-million record sales\nI done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself\nWhen alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect\nNeither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve\nTo be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions\nWhen the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion\nAnd I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it\nAnd I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it\nI ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it, will I change, boy I doubt it\nI done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward\nSee the paparazzi crowded all around me now\nSame niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now\nShowered with support from my adoring fans\nThey hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nYou've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes\nIt's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show\nYou see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it\nKnew the risks and the consequences and I still do it\nAnd then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it\nNot just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies\nThat's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me\nCause they just wanna live through me vicariously\nFashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar\nGet blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw\nGot the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer\nShowed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw\nTop dog would not fall, I am not y'all\nCouple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all\nKid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me\nIt's safer to watch it on T.V\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement\n\n[Verse 3: Usher]\nSee I don't think it would even matter (to me)\nWoking a nine to (five) would it be better, I mean honest\nWould you care to gossip about me, not likely\nI guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)\n(Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool\n(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth\nY'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too\nEasy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)\nHe said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)\nNo not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)\nWon't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)\nI know better than to ever talk during the film...\nIn' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight\nTo when you can't see what's wrong from right\nWell shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes\nAnd understand this is who I am\n\n[Verse 4: T.I.]\nUsher I completely concur\nLife can be such a blur, obviously we prefer\nOur privacy but instead we endure\nYes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me\nCause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me\nBut for the hustle and the lady on my arm now\nPlus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down\nAnd yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'\nLive one headline at a time\n\n[Hook: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cfd0caa9a36fd23db9dec05ae1a43aed.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
