I need to talk\nI'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk\nI'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault\nBut the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk\nYou never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard\nAnd I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God\nLot of things that I used to, I don't wanna\nRun the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna\nSpeak the word for You one day\nUp in there like, \"Hallelujah!\" on Sunday\nI thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me\nAnd for my life, with the blessings You have saved me\nAnd for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth\nMarried me to rough times, throughout my Youth\nAnd through it all I saw that You was still with me\nI was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me\n\n[Hook]\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[DMX]\nI look at life a little different now, since You hugged me\nAnd I always loved my peoples, but now they love me\nThank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya\nJacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia\nPleadin' the blood of Christ over our life\nWrong or right, just help us make it through the night\nAnd we'll shout Yo' name in times of need\nAnd times of joy, and, when we bleed\nAnd, when we are overcome with greed\nYou ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed\nAnd because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me\nAnd I won't drown no matter how deep the river be\nYou are the strength I, never knew I had\nKept the heart good when they told me it was bad\nAll praises due to Ya\nThat's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father\n\n[Hook]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[DMX]\nUhh... I never knew a love like, this before\nMessin with the thug life I, missed it all\nYou opened the doors and, let me in\nI'm down for the cause so, let's begin\nPrayers that You give to me I give to them\nSame way You live in me I live in them\nLife is a blessing now\nYou got me smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark\nAnd it doesn't rain anymore\nOnly sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my\nYou washed away the tears with the fears\nI'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years\nYou know that... one day I'll speak the word\nYou know that... when I do I will be heard\nYou know that... You gave me a permanent smile\nAnd You know this, Father, because I'm Yo' child, what?\n\n[Hook]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\n\n[Outro]\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...\nLord, You got me like... Your love got me like...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/afd6872a63df0f464c2e3cf8eb96a627.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
