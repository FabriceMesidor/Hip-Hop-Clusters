I should have stayed\nYou say the word, I'm on the way\nThis shit feels like teenage fever\nI'm not scared of it, she ain't either\nWhy second guess? I should have stayed\n'Cause you know what's on my mind so\n\n[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\n\n[Outro: Dave]\nYeah, slightly took a left turn there\nBut very much 6AM\nSlightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me\nMore ideas and stuff comin'\nYeah, yeah, fam\nI'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4672f8523e0fbf7f7848185256e946f4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
