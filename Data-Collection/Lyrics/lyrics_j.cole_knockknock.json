Cole]\nSometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero\nSometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo\nSometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego\nOther times a nigga swim around like Nemo\nUh, small fish in a big ass pond\nPushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn\nI get my weight up, inflate up\nAnd make these old niggas open the gate up\nAt the mansions that they laid up in\nLike, \"Hello my name is Cole\" - I'm walking right up in and well known\nDon't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow\nEither you follow me or swallow me bitch\nAnd I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit\nNow since I just seen my face up in the XXL\nA few chicks want to text \"let's chill\"-how obvious\nGirls from all over the world is my hobby\nAnd I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist\nMy old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with\nJust to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent\nThe moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing\nNow if you faking that baby you need to try acting\nHollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman\nDeliver that due to body good dick\nFeeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick\nTherefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up\nI'm a talk until you tell me shut up\nUh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up\nHuh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up\nAy, so what up\nHey, you heard that huh?\nOh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that\nUh, I text my number to you did you get that?\nHuh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back\nAnd I'll fix that\nTell me is you with that, hey\nAy tell me is you with that\nAy tell em is you with that\nYea, ay baby is you with that?
