So let her have my scrilla\nAnd cut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?\nAll this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E\nDrink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly\nAnd rhymin to remember what you told me\nHoley moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?\nYo G, remind me to remember what you told me\nWhoever don't feel him build walls like a goalie\nOne for the money, two for the better green\nThree for methanine-dioxymethamphetamine\nTold the knock kneed ghetto queen get the head fiend\nTell him it's for Medell\u00edn and use oxyacetylene\nWho needs airplay, it's all just hearsay\nLeave a wig like it was havin a bad hair day\nMiracle glide master, asked him what's his secret\nHe said Shasta, and turned to formaldehyde faster\nWhen I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily\nOne night she tried to flail me with her ukelele\nPack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat\nWith a bunch of crackers and some snack meat\n... You better have my scrilla\nCut it out with all that funny hand jive will ya?\nAll this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E\nDrink it all fast, make you haul ass slowly\nRemind me to remember what you told me\nHoley moley, did you get a load of her roley poley?\nYo G, remind me to remember what you told me\nAnd if you don't feel him build walls like a goalie", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bbffda688e1d494b60d0e40782d4f07d.353x353x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
