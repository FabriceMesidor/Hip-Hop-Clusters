in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\nThree-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\n\n[Verse 1: Techniec]\nI see 'em tryin shine like Tech\nCause I shine like I be grinding on the set, d-d-diamonds on my neck\nMost talked about when I hit that strip, watch it bounce when I hit that dip\nCome too close might get that clip, click BANG\nDon't trip, Tech don't slip, laces up the roll go get my bitch\nGet my grip, talk my shit, hit my switch and dip\nSwitchin lanes on them Dana Danes, same color as that candy paint\nTangerine with (I can't tell the rest cause of E-40)\n\n[Verse 2: E-40]\nI tried to never sober, chalupa, longer then a roller coster\nOut hear a head a hub a head and do ya for quarter ounce of yollup\nVenomos snakes, like some cobras, up top is where I'm from\nWe be lettin our nuts hang over our shoulders, figure 8 and go and duck\nDroppin with all 4 doors open, gassin and brakin and yolkin\nWe hyphy, we stupid valeho, Richmond, Frisco, Oakland\nWe 9ers, we raiders, we some hustlers and some players\nWe've got 64s and low lows, but most of us rider scrapas\n\n[Verse 3: Crooked I]\nLord forgive me it in me to sent me to tote semi's\nGulp Henny and Remy my pockets was so skinny\nNow I blow pennies on 4 hemi's\nRun the whole city/hoes, I put dough before any\nMy 6th sense helped me view better cheddar kid\nI fucks mo hoes then Hugh Heffner ever did\nThat new leather shit the coup hell sick\nDude move ahead of who ever cause dude never quit\n\n[Chorus: The Game]\nCherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\nThree-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\n\n[Verse 4: Chingy]\nCranberry impala, that's my lowrider\nSlide by your north sider rider with a ho driver\nG'd up from the feet up plus the heat tough\nToe game crack the grey goose and spark the weed up\nWhen I'm in LA I go in Crenshaw and floss a little\nSlot a lot thang in that Black Wall Street\nDouble U and P and CPT we keeping it G\nIn our low riders riders riders\n\n[Verse 5: Lil' Rob]\nWe put them cracks up on the wall, cucarachas crawl\nI keep my head up and it won't fall, no not at all\nI'll break ya jaw like a break the law, leave you all in all\nThe lowrider so low, you won't know what you saw\nI sit low with a tall can, in a brown bag\nWith a brown rag, bouncing a brown rag\nWith the Mexican flag and the American flag\nHitting the fronts and the backs, watching out for the bash\n\n[Paul Wall]\nHome boy, Big T, better know as Tyrone\nIs the first person I ever seen with a chevy on chrome\nMy parter bought it got the slab, wine berry over gold\nWith screen in the head rest just to let you know we holding\nI fell in love with it, and I dropped him some cash\nNow that's me you see flippin slab, riding on glass\nHow much it cost, don't ask, baby just know this\nI could bought a Benz instead with the money I spent\n\n[Chorus: The Game]\nCherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\nThree-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)\n\n[Verse 6: The Game]\nMy 64 sittin on that chrome, chrome Glock sitting on my lap\n2 hoes ridin in the back, candy paint, nigga fuck with that\n3-wheel motion, I'm sitting high, daytonas, that's all we ride\nHit that switch its do or die, ride on me that's suicide\nI be in the hood smoking that green, Dr.Dre know what I mean\nSwisha sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed\nBlack diamonds off in my chain/ ask around nigga know my name\nCompton own, the rap Lebron James, ridin low, I'm switchin lanes\n\n[Verse 7: W.C.]\nMake that brain splat 30 thang thang clap\nKnow for the game rap with the chrome frame wrap\nFrom Harley Davidsons to low lows, we do tip 'em\n13 hundred spokes with that blue nibble get the picture\nDisrespect and I'm draw slugs\nBut ain't no set trippin cause nigga its all love\nDub C drop the real on 'em, chevy chrome grill on 'em\nPosing in the intersection, 3-wheelin on 'em nigga\n\n[Verse 8: Ice Cube]\nRasberry 64 bring your cherry\nAnd we could make a Sunday, come home Monday\nI'm sittin on the one-way, up on the Boulevard\nAct hard, put ya thoughts on the dashboard\nCause if I come through the hood with the little homie\nNobody better fuck with the little homie\nI hope Compton unite, South Central unit\nI hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light\n\n[Chorus: The Game]\nCherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)\nChrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my
