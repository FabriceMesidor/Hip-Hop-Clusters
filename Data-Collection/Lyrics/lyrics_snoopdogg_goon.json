(Hot outside)\nI just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)\nWhat you need? (What you need?)\nIs put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)\nHere's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze\nOh! Do-do-do, do-do-do\nLet's smoke and ride...\nBaby if you feel the same, let me know\n(If you feel the same, then let me know)\nI wanna rock ya, girl... (Oh!)\nYes I do!\nWhat you got to lose?\n\n[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]\nYou done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good\nStop, now , top down through the neighborhood\nLet the wind blow, open up the window\nThat girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe\nWe have a barbeque to do at four\nSwimming pool party in the back on the low\nBYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free\nLittle kids get down, I\u2019ll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown\nNow do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work\nAnd do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt\nPlaying mama dear, calm and clear\nThis that time of the year\nFor everybody to be boisterous\nRock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this\n\n[Chorus: October London]\nAs we go on... (We go on)\nLike we do... (Like we do)\nWhen it's hot outside... (Hot outside)\nI just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)\nWhat you need? (What you need?)\nIs put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)\nHere's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze\nOh! Do-do-do, do-do-do\nLet's smoke and ride...\nBaby if you feel the same, let me know\n(If you feel the same, then let me know)\nI wanna rock ya, girl... (Oh!)\nYes I do!\nWhat you got to lose?\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nShined up my white walls, night falls\nI'm feeling hella good\nI'm doin thangs that you never would\nLike surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark\nRiding on a bike with my grandson at the park\nEvolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate\nBreakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter\nFinna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion\nI'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars\nNeighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard\nWe go, till we can't go no more\nIt's me and mines, it's summertime\nYou go off and we go on\n\n[Chorus: October London]\nAs we go on... (We go on)\nLike we do... (Like we do)\nWhen it's hot outside... (Hot outside)\nI just wanna chill with you... (Chill with you)\nWhat you need? (What you need?)\nIs put ya mind at ease... (Mind at ease)\nHere's a little sun shinin', drink and a summer breeze\nOh! Do-do-do, do-do-do\nLet's smoke and ride...\nBaby if you feel the same, let me know\n(If you feel the same, then let me know)\nI wanna rock ya, girl...
