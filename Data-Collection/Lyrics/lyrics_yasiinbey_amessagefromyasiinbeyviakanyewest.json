Peace to all, fear none, this is Yasiin Bey. At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I'm being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They're saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they're making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it's not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation's state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they're there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I've made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I'm under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I'm being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It's curious. I haven't broken any law, and I'm being treated like a criminal. I know I'm not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I'm here with my family. I haven't been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There's no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There's no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I'm not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I'm not- I just wanna go home, and I don't live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference\n\nThe state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that\n\nPeace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all\n\nIn summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen\n\nAnd I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach. Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to my brother Talib Kweli, salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Islam, all of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation real here; there's real Zulus. My brother, Siyabonga, the Madlalas. All of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. I love the people of this country. I love this continent. I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on \"No More Parties in LA,\" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K. Lamar, too; I see you, my dude\nLonely America, crazy America\nLoud ass, country ass, cocaine America\nLethal America, carcinogen, asthma\nCarbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma\nLights and camera, action, surveillance\nHelicopters, teleprompters\nFlossy newscasters, rich, fool, bastards\nWar, migrant workers, cold murder, traffic\nWelcome to Los... stop right there\nBiggie got shot right here\nAngeles\nHollywood, hoes, handguns\n\nPeace to all, fear none.
