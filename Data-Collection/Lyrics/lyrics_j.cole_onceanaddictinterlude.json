You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed\"\nI shake my head in frustration\nHead to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut\nFuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone\nOff to college and dorms\nFoolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone\nBut now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone\nI know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down\nShe lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed\nBut I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds\nThinkin' to myself, \"Maybe my mama need help\nDon't she got work in the morning?\nWhy she do this to herself?\nHate how she slurrin' her words\nSoundin' so fuckin' absurd\nThis ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?\nWhy don't I say how I feel?\nWhen I do, she's defensive for real\nWell maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals\nLittle did I know how deep her sadness would go\nLookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'\n\n[Outro]\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it go\nOut of fear I won't be free\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it go\nOut of fear I won't be\u2014\nNo!\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it go\nRight\nLife can bring much pain\nThere are many ways to deal with this pain (right)\nChoose wisely (right)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b25da0e24e4501069a3362b517ef0516.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
