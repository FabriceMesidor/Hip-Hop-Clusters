Touch me right there\nWanna touch my nookie, baby? Touch me right there\nMake me lose my mind, baby? Touch me right there\nParty over here, ain't shit over there\nSee how I'm drillin' 'em, baby?\nIt's Bus-a-Bus back, bitch, I'm killin' 'em crazy\nWe off the Relaxic, I'm spillin' the gravy\nGot every club packed thick, creating a frenzy\nTo be the latest greatest for all you niggas from gazing\nBugatti, off white, tan, interior pastry\nSee my swagger sharp like that, these niggas amaze me\nAs a matter a fact just salute me and praise me, enough of that\nWe be up in the club, niggas sportin' them minks\nTipsy in the club, nigga buyin' 'em drinks\nWalk around, lookin' like our shit don't stink\nIce by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink\nOkay, now I got me a clear view\nI like it when you get up and I'm lovin' ya hairdo\nThe way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you\nThe way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through\nAppreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel\nI came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue\nShorty ain't checkin' for you, step to the way I do\nSuper senile, I ain't the one to compare to\nNow she was sayin'\nSee the ass? Touch me right there\nWanna touch my nookie, baby? Touch me right there\nIs that Dr. Dre, baby? Touch me right there\nParty over here, ain't shit over there\nPop yo' collars like this\nBottles up like this\nSide to side like this\nHolla if ya like this\nWhat you sayin', Missy?\nPop yo' collars like this\nBottles up like this\nSide to side like this\nHolla if ya like this\nWe got some shit for that ass\nCome on, give it to me\nWe got some shit for that ass\nCome on, give it to me\nWe got some shit for that ass\nCome on, give it to me\nWe got some shit for that ass, girl\nBounce back, brand new on the scene, what?\nTook a little minute, I'm back with the re-up\nSwitched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut\nShorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up\nI love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up\nIt's gettin' hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up\nAmazed by the pinky, neck and wrist be gleaming up\nHow I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up\nI see you liking everything, you see me and you\nYou frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo\nThe hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you\nYa girl looking like she wit' it, she can come in too\nYou get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move\nI'm bangin' in the truck, and let her watch in the rearview\nSee we don't really care about the niggas who came through\nOver there 'cause over here, see I'ma show ya how we do\nSo check it, baby\nSee the ass? Touch me right there\nWanna touch my nookie, baby? Touch me right there\nMake me lose my mind, baby? Touch me right there\nParty over here, ain't shit over there\nSee, it don't matter what ya doin' over there\nSee, we gets it poppin', that's how we do it over here\nThat's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here\nCheck it, floss models, that's how we do it over here\nListen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here\nCheck it, ice collars, that's how we do it over here, nigga\nSee, it don't matter what ya doin over there\nSee, we gets it poppin', that's how we do it over here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54314abfbbbf16253d72455428cc44e6.834x834x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
