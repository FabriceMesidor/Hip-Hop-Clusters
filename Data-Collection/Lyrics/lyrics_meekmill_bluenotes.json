We on it\nWhen the night is cold and lonely\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nGave you the plug\nTry to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money\nAnd show 'em some love\nYou did me a favor, I knew you was shiesty\nI knew you would show who you was\nIt's only a matter of time before niggas get lined\nAnd hit with them slugs\nGet found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga\n'Member they told me that we would fail\n'Member they said we would see a cell\nDown with that semi like Cam Newton\nI'm in the field like the NFL\nNiggas is sick' and I wish em well\nI made a wish in a wishing well\nI put a brick in a wishing well\nBeen through some shit and I'm sick of jail\nNo disease but I'm sick of cells\nSick and tired of sending niggas mail\nCalling niggas just to get a bail\nI just seen a nigga get a L\nNever coming homeand minute on the phone\nSick and tired of seeing niggas fail\nSick and tired of seeing niggas lose\nSinning like we tryna get to hell\n\n[Outro: Snowy White]\nThis is my blues\n'Cause I'm back down on my own again\nThis is the blues I'm playing\nYes, it's a final thing\nWhen the night is cold and lonely", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd74651c0c076f404b493be47f954683.1000x993x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
