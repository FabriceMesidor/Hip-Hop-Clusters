A understatement to say\nThat K Lamar was under pressure\nDon't press your luck when you pressed for time\nCause when the press get this verse\nThey're sure to press rewind\nA president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac\nCodeine, crack and codiac\nEnough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we\nWyling on the corners with the ? rats\nNiggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti\nDon't run his trap. See the fans that tap out\nThat's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case\nWith the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch\nWe catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies\nFuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton\nMy impurity is probably your best asset\nSpit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address\nLeave em stagnant\nThis is torture when I scorch ya\nOr escort ya out the building with ex-convicts\nAnd all sorts of criminal handshakes\nYour man can't stick to the script\nWith handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip\nThen poppin your van, wait\nI want the peace. But keep the piece\nThat I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
