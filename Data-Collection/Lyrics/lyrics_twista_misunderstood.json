Is he off of syrup?\nSomething deep with Formula 44 of Benadryl?\n'Cause a nigga finna kill\nMisunderstood 'cause I'm passin' whatever disaster\nIt's not 'cause I'm blasphemous\nI leave a nigga body bloody like\nPassions of Christ with a mask and a knife\nGo blast with the mic\nIf His prophecy the first shall be last\nThen I am the future, you are a primitive\nMorph-ism, a scorpion, these shoes are venomous\nThe new artillerist\nAnd you don't really wanna start from Genesis\nAnd you don't really wanna spark the nemesis\nGet loose if it's a crucifix, I put you on it for murder boy\nYou don't wanna bring darkness into this\n\n[Yung Buk]\nYeah, all those that relate then you can feel my pain\nTryna walk straight away from the hatred\nThat I hold deep down inside, quiet\nI wait, I never talk shit about a nigga biz\n'Cause a nigga's his, and besides that\nI ain't no fuckin' kid, you bitch\nYou really know it coulda done and been some shit\nThere could have been a minutes\nThat's we really could of plenty through\nBut all of this bitchin' cleanin' shit\nSeven-hundred million in the plastic\nI just consider it all as destiny\nManifestin' itself, no fin' to shit\nSteppin' over holes, watching my steps\nYou don't know what I been through bitch\n\n[Twista]\nYet I get money like I'm Pitbull, rich\nThen when I hear an instrumental, I get into it\nFeel a mental glitch\nThen I gotta cut a motherfucker like a Ginsu bitch\nAfter that I'm nothing be held to love\nEspecially if I feel with Beelzebub\nInstead of the Holy Divine, I be outta my mind\nAnd I would detail a thug\n\n[Hook: Twista + (Yung Buk)]\n(I'm a misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why\n'Cause I'm kind of like Kurt Cobain\nAn expert on pain, you fear it, I got lyrics\nAnd a pistol that'll hurt your brain\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why\n'Cause I'm kind of like Tyler Durden\nI can fuck a nigga up as [?] my body with flames\nAnd never feel the fire hurt me\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)\nLike I would be only black ain't walk too weak\nWhat I do for the hood is for the good, O.G. swag nigga\nDon't talk when I speak\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)\nKing Neal, Willy Lloyd, and Angelo Roberts\nWhen it come to a flow, you think your man go hard\nBut shit, this man'll go harder\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)\n\n[Twista]\nI'm about to fuck shit up\nGot me rippin' through your body like a natural disaster\nMoving like a torpedo with the speed and the vengeance of a killer\nIf you looking for a murderer, I'm the master motherfucker\nI'm about to tear shit up\nWith heat from a thermometer\nGo get your momma to pay for the burial\nI'm an astonishing, inter-planetary\nDevouring everything from Earth to Andromeda, they feelin' me\n'Cause I'm about to fuck shit up\nLike Freddy after Jason with a fascination for a laceration\nAnd congratulations for eradication\nBecause I know ain't no vaccination for decapitation\nAt a rapper pacing, I'm about to tear shit up\nBecause I take hits with that purple like I am a Viking\nCall me lyrical-ution\nI run with a mob of wolves like I am a lycan\nSome off the top, some I am writin'\nAnd if you ain't strapped, iron, we fightin'\nCan't rock by me, runnin' through the middle of the field\nWith that white like I am a titan\nNiggas never know what Twista be on\nLow key nigga fuckin' with a bitch from the hood\nI insist that I talk to the psycho psychiatrist\n'Cause I'm misunderstood\n\n[Yung Buk]\nDoctor I'm problematic, tryna withdraw from always lawlessly Resolvin' all of my static 'cause I know God is calling me\nBut not to come home yet\nBasically about the own set\nOf blessings from the seeds that I've sown\nSome yet might not be up on yet\nBut any anyhow niggas tryna pin me down\nWith bullshit I'll try to keep it moving\nUntil they fuck up and I distribute the blaow!\n'Cause I'm bound by law, pure Chicago crown by the bosses\nOn Scuva Streets my project window down town office\nAll I want is my music, my money, my muh'fuckin'\nShit to be viewed among the elite, not to sleep I was thuggin'\nI'm just a good nigga, up to no good nigga\nSuburbs to the hood I wish you fuckin' would nigga\n\n[Hook: Twista + (Yung Buk)]\n(I'm a misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why\n'Cause I'm kind of like Kurt Cobain\nAn expert on pain, you fear it, I got lyrics\nAnd a pistol that'll hurt your brain\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga) Tell 'em why\n'Cause I'm kind of like Tyler Durden\nI can fuck a nigga up as [?] my body with flames\nAnd never feel the fire hurt me\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)\nLike I would be only black ain't walk too weak\nWhat I do for the hood is for the good, O.G. swag nigga\nDon't talk when I speak\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)\nKing Neal, Willy Lloyd, and Angelo Roberts\nWhen it come to a flow, you think your man go hard\nBut shit, this man'll go harder\nBecause I'm a (misunderstood nigga)", "image":
