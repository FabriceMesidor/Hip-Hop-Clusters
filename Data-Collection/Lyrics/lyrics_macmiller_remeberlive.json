He was part lion\nLife goes on, tears all dryed in\nCouple years are gone by by then\nCan you please help me find my friend\nI'll give you anything you need\nMultiplied by ten\nI heard he moved to a place\nWhere the time don't end\nYou don't need money\nAll you got is time to spend\nLife is short, don't ever question the lengths\nIt's cool to cry\nDon't ever question your strength\nI recommend no limits, intricate\nThought, go 'head just give it a shot\nYou'll remember shit you've forgot\n\n[Bridge]\nCause way back then I didn't know shit\nAnd I don't know shit now\nAnd when the whole world is looking hopeless\nI'mma still hold shit down\n\n[Hook]\nI remember when we were just kids\nWe knew nothing at all, we'd talk about the life we lived\nIn West Virginia, lost somewhere out in\nWest Virginia", "image": "https://images.genius.com/db53bad96e691f9ab9aec5c0405e2fc5.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
