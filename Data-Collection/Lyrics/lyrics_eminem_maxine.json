Another nigga? It's okay.\"\nShe said: \"No I forgot to tell you\nThat I got AIDS, I got a problem.\"\n\n[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]\nHey, Maxine\nWhat?\nYou thinkin' about suckin' my dick?\nYeah, for a small price\nFor a small price? What you mean?\nYou know, money, nigga\nYou don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit\nWhat you, what you hear I got?\nAIDS\nWho told you that bullshit?\nMy nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie\nWell, if that's the case, Kyu got it then\nOh for real, it's like that?\nWell, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit\nAnd if he do, he ain't get that shit from me\nI ain't fuckin' around with no third nigga\nFuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you\nNo, see\u2026\nYou got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you\nHold on, why it ain't even like that\nI want y'all to get paid, fuckin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a4f759aba2e16ec0dc9f29d1577cfede.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
