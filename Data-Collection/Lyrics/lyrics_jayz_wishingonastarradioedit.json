Bye\"\nI was too deep for you from day one\nThat\u2019s why we never had relations, continued in my own zone\n\n(Chorus: Gwen Dickey)\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come\nAnd I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done\n\n(Verse 3: Jay-Z)\nUh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks\nRun, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark\nWanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample\nDangerous games we played on the third rail\nFiend for the summer breeze\nHopped out the Lee's Dungrares\nInto the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports\nTo take us away from here, but I cut too much\nSo I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush\nMy sinners used to back me up\nLike Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me\nAll my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll\nLet's reach for the stars now... Jigga!\n\n(Chorus: Gwen Dickey)\nI'm wishing on a star to follow where you are\nI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means\nAnd I wish on all the rainbows that I see\nI wish on all the people who really dream\nAnd I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come\nAnd I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
