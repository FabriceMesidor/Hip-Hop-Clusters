I\u2019m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell\nUsed to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail\nSame shit, different air freshener\nI don\u2019t play, boy, I ain\u2019t Hugh Hefner\nTryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind\nTwo fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind\nI be in the cloud, cloud number 9\nAnd I just fucked the clock and let it come to time\nIt\u2019s a cold world, I put on a mink\nThere\u2019s a chain of command, I\u2019m the missing link\n\n[Hook]\nGod bless Amerika\nThis ole' godless Amerika\nI heard tomorrow ain\u2019t promised today\nAnd I\u2019m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet\n\n[Outro]\nHere we live by the sword and die by the sword\nHeard police was lookin' for me, I\u2019mma hide by a broad\nShootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket\nI\u2019m wired out the socket, but still shockin'\nEverybody wanna tell me what I need\nYou can play a role in my life but not the lead\nI saw a butterfly in hell today\nWill I die or go to jail today?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/025852747d34bfec09080ad4c10b07b6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
