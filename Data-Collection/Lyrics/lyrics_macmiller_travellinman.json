The high life and I'm gone\n\n(Chorus)\nMemories don't live like people do, they always remember you\nWhether things are good or bad, it's just the memories\nMemories don't live like people do baby don't forget me\nI'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time\nGot a lot of things I got to do\nBut lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo\nI'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time\nGot a lot of things I got to do\nBut god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo\n\n(Verse 2)\nMy plane coming down and I'm happy to land\nEvery time I got to go my girl grabbing my hand\nTrying to pull me back to her, and as mad as I am\nI gotta make this money I'm a traveling man\nSo through airplane, boat, or packed in a van\nBaby I'mma hurry back to you as fast as I can\nIt don't matter what I gotta do\nDreams I gotta follow you\nLove is what I'm falling to\nAnd ever do I follow through\nSo ima put it all on you\nJust know that I ain't got a clue\nBut baby I be watching you copping you some Prada shoes\nHurt me when I watch the news\nThe doctor is in the hospitals trying to heal the sick\nBut all their chances is impossible\nGiving the word like literature spitting the verse\nFor all of those who live in the Berg\nI travel the word the land and the sea\nHere to open up your mind\nJust hand me the key\n\n(Chorus)\nMemories don't live like people do, they always remember you\nWhether things are good or bad, it's just the memories\nMemories don't live like people do baby don't forget me\nI'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time\nGot a lot of things I got to do\nBut lord willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo\nI'm a traveling man, moving through places space and time\nGot a lot of things I got to do\nBut god willing I'm coming back to you, baby boo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4186ee36b844bd7bbde71da3b370390b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
