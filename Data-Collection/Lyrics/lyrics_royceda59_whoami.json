Fuck you!\nNiggas better know that I'm something they'll never know\nAll you'll ever know is that hurt in his name\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)\nYou know that I will hurt you\nYou know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon\nNigga I'm pain, yeah, I hope you like the name (I'm comin' for you)\nNo need to fight the pain, cause he will strike again\n\nNigga I'm pain, (I'm comin' for you)\nYou know that I will hurt you\nYou know I'll rise to hurt you, and you know I'll be back soon\nNigga I'm pain, yeah, I hope you like the name (I'm comin' for you)\nNo need to fight the pain, cause he will strike again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2e33562233c0c84cdaac4c3b252d599c.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
