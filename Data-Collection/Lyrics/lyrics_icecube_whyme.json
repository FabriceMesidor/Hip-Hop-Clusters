I'm a real live man\nYou a persona, now I'm a goner\nCall my momma, and the coroner\nMr. Gun Man, your plan is workin'\nCause niggas is dyin', and mommas is hurtin'\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'\n\n[Ice Cube]\nI was made by the one and only G-O-D\nTo take my life, to the T-O-P\nNow here comes a motherfuckin' D-O-G\nWho ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P\nTryin' to be somethin' he saw on BET\nEither T.I.P., or B.I.G\nI don't give a fuck what you saw on TV\nBut a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G\nI'm an O.G., never had to fake it\nGod gave me this, how you gon' take it?\nWhat'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven\nAnd he asks you why did you send back his present?\nWho the fuck are you? you motherfuckin peasant!\nEven got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing\nSend his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes\nNigga hell on earth is bein' stuck in the 80's\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'\n\n[Ice Cube]\nBefore you shoot me man think about it\nLet's go have a drink about it (Yeah)\nBefore you make a stink about it\nMan let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it\nBut just don't be a coward\nAnd take my life, cause you got the power\nOf the white man's gunpowder\nCause you might face a gun tower\nAnd time never run out\nThey take the fun out, 'til your life run out\nSo don't pull the gun out\nIf you ever want a house just like Run's house\nIt's better than the big house\nLet's go find some women we can dig out\nFind a place we can pig out\nParty all night 'til the owner say get out\n\n[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]\nWhy you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me\nYou don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree\nNow, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me\nYou never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'\n\n[Ice Cube]\nDedicated to all the niggas\nThat's dead and don't know why\nWho wanna look at the nigga that shot 'em\nAnd ask these questions\nWhy me homey, why me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/284f4145950de6c7f91a598379e2bb40.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
