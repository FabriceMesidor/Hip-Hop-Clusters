I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates. \"Hip to the Game\", one of like\u2014one of the illest beats ever and I remember when Mac flipped that shit for Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza\u2014I thought it was the dopest shit man. Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own\u2014me and all my boys, all my homies\u2014 and if it wasn't for him killing that beat I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous. Damn... that's like 2010. And I titled the track \"Young Sinatra.\" And that was the birth of all this shit.
