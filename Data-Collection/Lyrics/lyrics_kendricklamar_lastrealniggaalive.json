Dot from Compton\nMan Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'\nBut I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me\nUntil I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet\nMe at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour\nTold me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour\nJay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape\nWas skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed\nBut we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap\nDid our first collaboration on the Nephew track\nHe got signed months later, Warner Brothers\nWe started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper\nBefore Sidekicks became a modern day phone\nSame time our buzz was generated from G Malone\nHe had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it\nSaid that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget\nNow that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life\nBut not knowing how to market it right\nTurned on the radio\nOnly cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop\nAnd by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous\nIn the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft\nWhat the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up\nIt was a hit\nWhen I heard it\nBut all we had was the instrumental and the hook\nBut when\nRock jump on it for certain, it was to smash\nGave it to Julio, just to get his opinion\nNext thing you know, the record was\nSpinning\nThat was a good look, it set the coast on fire\nNiggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot\nThen these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station\nAsk why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?\nShit was funny to us tho\nNiggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo\nIn the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy\nI had a situation with Def Jam, premature\nShit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care\nI was glad Jay-Z gave me respect\nSee I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock\nFar as radio play, obvious, he got a lot\nBeefing\u2019 with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it\nWhich in my opinion, I didn\u2019t think the shit was impo\u2019tant\nBut that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother story, we hit the lab with Game\nAnd a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy\nDid the cypher freestyle and everybody\u2019s like, \"Wow\"\nThese Top Dawg niggas \u2018bout to make noise\"\nSurely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that\nBut right after that, we didn\u2019t see him no more\nG Malone came with a smash hit with Akon\nMistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm\nThen everybody start to scream out the new West\nAnd claim that West Coast legends don\u2019t want to see him at best\nI think that\u2019s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight\nTell \u2018em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice\nThen Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin\u2019 the internet\nBut he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about\nAnd all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too\nIt finally started to look like the West was makin\u2019 moves\nWestern Union had the whole block boomin\u2019 because of Snoop\nMatter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group\nThen ?Problem? took off, another Compton native\nWe both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it\nBy this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves\nWe almost got into some major beef over Lil\u2019 Wayne\nThat part I'mma leave out\nTheres certain things that the streets only should know about\nShout out to Nipsey\nBishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O\nThat\u2019s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me\nBecause they didn\u2019t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it\nThat\u2019s a goddamn power move stupid\nYou foolish, don\u2019t know shit about this war shit\nTheres mo\u2019 shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit\n\n[Chorus]\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe\u2019s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that\u2019s official\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe\u2019s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that\u2019s official\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nSo two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too\nAnd said he was partners with Game\nThe nigga finally told me what he said\nHe said he didn\u2019t like it\nBut the niggas like\n\u201cSee, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight\u201d\nNigga probably never even gave it to him and shit\n\n[Ended with shout outs]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
