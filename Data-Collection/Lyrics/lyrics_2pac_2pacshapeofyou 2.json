Keys to ignition, use at your discretion\nRoll with a 12 gauge pump for protection\nNiggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking\nTurn to Smith & Wesson war weapons\nHeavenly Father, I'm a soldier\nI'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder\nBaby, let me hold ya\nTalk to my guns like they fly bitches\nAll you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!\n\nNow I know the answers to the question\n\u201cDo dreams come true?\u201d\nStill staring at the world through my rearview\nI said now I know the answers, \u201cDo dreams come true?\u201d\nStaring at the world through my rearview\n\nStaring at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die\nGetting high, watching time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\nStaring at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die\nGetting high, watching time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\nStaring at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die\nGetting high, watching time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
