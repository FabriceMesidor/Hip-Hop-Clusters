There ain't nothin' left to sell\nSo she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell\nIt's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain\nProstitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name\nShe's got a baby", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ba5e4aab9567a57abe5189cd8b742a55.399x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
