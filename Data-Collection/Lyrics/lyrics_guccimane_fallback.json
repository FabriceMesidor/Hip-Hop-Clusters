You can say it up front\nI don't think I'm all that, I'm just kinda laid back\n22s on the bed, 20 Os in the front\nHad them hoes hang hard, tryna make it, think so\nPut a rock on you, big, it's like a cruise ship\nSo don't call me Gucci Mane, so don't call me ...\nEver since people in Beverly Hills sending you gifts\nUse your crown, no hate, he don't ware enough, baby\nWe can rent our crustaceous, take a vacation\nFly to Bora Bora, call you Dora the Explorer\nDoors can't give a ball, it's all involved\nHaters can't crawl cause they know you're their boss\nYou done make it who you are, you was born to be a star\nWatch your wrist like that, you deserve a new car\nMe only copping that but I love you copping that\nYou started copping that but you acting fine so I think I need to phone back\n\nShe ended up being with him, should've been with me\nI thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be\nIf it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see\nBut until then I'mma fall back like a G\nI think I need to fall back\nI think I need to fall back\n\nBang, bang, titty, I done bang, bang nitty\nMost girls are the same, I was saying you was different\nAll your friends with you, they be like 'bitch, you tripping'\nIf you wasn't, I be with him, I'm a YM fly nigga\nCan't fall in love with a stripper but I just love the way your face fall on my zipper\nI ain't no tricker, but love got me tripping\nMight have to tip her if she show me titty\nBad to the bone, baby, bad, hop on my lap, cause she want with my cash\nShe doing too much and I'm moving too fast\nDamn, a nigga need to fall, fall back\nFall back? No more chilling, how your day go?\nI'mma A ho, O, cause I'm single, no bitch, you play, don't play me\nLike a Lego so yeah, I'm gonna let go\n\nShe ended up being with him, should've been with me\nI thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be\nIf it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see\nBut until then I'mma fall back like a G\nI think I need to fall back\nI think I need to fall back\n\nI'm in my Bentley, ocean rider, won't you jump off in my lap\nYou wanna get no Channel, clicking crabs outside\nI need to fall back cause she got me all trapped\nTry to throw me y'all test, said you met your real love\nMake the head go, when she see me panics up\nI have her walking out of filth, you got her walking out of church\nDon't be quick, that loser chose her, ruler, come and get a chop\nBaby, I don't think you want it, boo, but you should see what you count, Gucci\n\nShe ended up being with him, should've been with me\nI thought that we were meant to be but I can tell was not to be\nIf it was meant to be then it would be so I'mma see\nBut until then I'mma fall back like a G\nI think I need to fall back\nI think I need to fall back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c7ed83845eb021940125a831f5a2f11.667x667x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
