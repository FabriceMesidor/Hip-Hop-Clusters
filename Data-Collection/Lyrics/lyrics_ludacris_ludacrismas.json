Turn it up until I wake up all the neighbours\nThey say that I\u2019m a nuissance but I say they all some haters\nJust because I\u2019m poor they always calling me a faker\nAnd cause my Christmas tree's decorated in toilet paper\nBut little do they know\nThey 'bout to see a show\nCause when they come up out the house I\u2019m gonna blast 'em with some snow\nFrosty\u2019s never seen nothing quite like this\nAnd St. Nick\u2019s never seen nothing quite like Cris\nSo um\u2026\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, chestnuts roasting on the fire in the hills\nBut down below we firing up the barbeque grills\nIce skating in the driveway\nI'mma do it my way\nEggnogs got daddy swerving on the highway\nStains on the tires, ice up on the window\n10 degress Fahrenheit freezing as the wind blow\nHelp me take my boots off\nAnd my snow suit off\nGet up in the house and my nose is redder than Rudolph's\nI think I need some help\nWith the buckle on my belt\nAnd if Santa doesn\u2019t show I want his cookies and his milk\nTell him i need a jacket, new Jordans and a XBox\nNew suits for church and a couple pairs of dress socks\nStuff my stocking with Jolly Ranchers and candy canes\nInvite my aunties and uncles, let's do the family thing\nMeanwhile I'm hoping Santa got my wishlist\nSo I could wake up to a very merry Cris'mas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh yeah, I hear the sleigh bells ringing and the jingle bells rock\nSanta never seen the jingle bells on my block\nI hear he\u2019s making that list, checking the thing twice\nI guess it\u2019s probably cause I been naughty not nice\nBut I'mma straighten up my act\nGet up on track\nMake a couple bucks and buy Mama a Cadillac\nAnd then maybe Santa Claus will come around my way\nSo all the kids on my block can look up and say \"hey!\"\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d211edacb8de02968540124c6801063d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
