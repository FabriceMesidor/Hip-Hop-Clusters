Could it be a jack?\nNow pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan\nThere them bitches go, Civic '94\nLooking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile\nFuck two already, third ass was heavy\n\"Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?\"\nWalked in the house, snatched off they clothes\nRan through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like\nCan't find my man, heard a blam-blam\nNow I'm wondering, \"In this scam, do I even stand a chance?\"\nHe killed the hoes, took all they dough\nFire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs\nNow he wanting mine, reaching for my nine\nAiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time\nMy nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering\n\"Put your gun down, we can skip town\"\nRocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat\nLift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range\n\n[Chorus]\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?\n(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d23a600c139bca90fa38b331a4e93acd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
