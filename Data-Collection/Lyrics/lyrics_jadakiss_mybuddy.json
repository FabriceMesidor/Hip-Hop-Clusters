Double R and D-Block\n\n[Verse 2 : Sheek Louch]\n\nAll these sweet ass niggas give me space\nBasic look, something light but I'm heavy at chase\nLet the nine blow out your face\nBetter hope I roll 4,5,6, cause it's on if I ace\nMotherfuckers ain't hard, you pussy god\nI treat the whole New York like the yard\nStick to myself, nigga front, Sheek pulling his card\nI don't think these niggas got brains\nKnowing that I'm working with, ahh, little bit of change\nAnd will hop out the drivers side of the Range\nAnd shoot all around like a young Dan Ainge\nSheek get it popping like a dope head's veins\nWith two dancers with me but not like Kane's\nYou as fake as these T.V. shows\nI ain't watching but I know how the ending goes\nMad holes through the side of your Benz\nEverybody running off, nothing like the finale of Friends\nYou talk greezy but it's only talk\nYou don't mean no harm like George do Weezie\nWhen Sheek have beef it's like Dre and Eazy\nBig and Pac, somebody better leave me\nIt's D-Block, celebrate nigga\nEverything cool, I got my smoke and lil bit of liquor", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1c8402a55fdbc84ca7b4917a823d724.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
