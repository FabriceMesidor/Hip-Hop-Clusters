Let me order it\nI got a masters in freestyle\nAnd a \"hook singing\" baccalaureate\nCause I never back down\nY'all niggas be so wack I hear your engineers laughing in the background\nBawling like, \"Why the fuck them niggas say that?\nFuck this session, where's 9th and Phonte at?\"\nNiggas kill me with superfluous schemes\nBut y'all ain't fucking with the merchant of dreams\nIt's like this and we gettin' it\n\n[Hook]\nWe got the crown, y'all can't take it back\nYou wanna battle?\nIt's too late for that\nDa da da dum dum it's too late\nDa da da dum dum it's too late\n\n[Outro] [Phonte talking]\nCause you get an F- for your poor performance", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b32e74d81cb12ffdcc5c3dd2c75161d4.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "9th Wonder"}
