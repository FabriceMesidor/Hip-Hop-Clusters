She need an ass whippin'\nI was told Ton' was home, I'm way past fifth and\nGuess it's time to get in my zone, this my last mission\nDid what I could do with this pump and I'm like fuck it\nFeelin' like Hammer on crutches, he can't touch this\nIllustrious, multi movements\nI drew the blueprints but now it's time for improvements\nPress his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful\nShit police do, we could never be a equal\nExecution, I get it in, retribution\nBest solution, get up close when you're shootin'\nShit for realler, I'm mad raw with a killer\nWhat's even iller, I knew the boss since Thriller\n'Til we're even, I guess it's gon' be grievin'\nA lot can change in 36 seasons\n\n[Hook] x2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b7e8d5889ca7a25f1f186a54b799b1ab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
