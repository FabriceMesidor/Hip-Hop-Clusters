You would never know\nHalf my team illiterate, I know it sound pathetic\nBut we can each get a brick that's on a line of credit\nLot of niggas died over fake pieces\nAnd the day I go, I pray my son, he get to read this\n\n[Chorus: Sam Harvey]\nBroken memories always fade\nLive on and you will find a way\nThings will be okay, don't be afraid\nLive on and you will find a way (Maybach Music)\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nUh, I only remember nights that was post-traumatic\nSo I'm never actin' bougie like I was supposed to have it\nServing addicts, toting ladders, it was so dramatic\nPutting friends before my family my worsest habit\n'Cause in my hood, it ain't no friends when you get the Benz\n'Cause homie in the backseat wanna split your wig\nJust to play the driver seat and say he hit a lick\nAnd he gon' post it on the 'Gram like, \"Don't forget the vid'\"\nSeen niggas tell on their own homies just to get to LIV\nMiami on a Sunday just to commit them sins\nAnd these the ones we supposed to ride for, forget the kids\nThrow your life away for a nigga that wouldn't send your kids\nTwenty dollars when you in your bid, this the way we live, the way we did\n'Cause I'm in the chains, fuck the way it is\nThe way it was, now the only way is up\nI'm never into faking love, I'm only here to wake you up\nYoung nigga\n\n[Chorus: Sam Harvey]\nBroken memories always fade\nLive on and you will find a way\nThings will be okay, don't be afraid\nLive on and you will find a way\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nIn a 911, came without a ceiling\nCan't imagine all the pain your brother was concealing\nWhen we order fully loaded 'cause it's so appealing\nSue you and then do you for a couple million\nStarted from the bottom, rip the carpet up\nParents great examples 'cause they never argue much\nAir conditioner in the window, watch the water drip\nPremonitions of my death is what I wanna miss\nPretty pictures of my kids the only ones I kiss (Lord)\nWhen you get a second chance, young brother, what a gift (Yes)\nNew obituaries everywhere I look\nPraying every hour God keep me on His books (Jesus)\nCemeteries, we pull up on 'em in foreign cars (Jesus)\nExtended payments elated, now met with open arms (Jesus)\nLook at all these rappers wearing bogus charms (Lord)\nWhen they barely pay for marijuana in cigars\n\n[Chorus: Sam Harvey]\nBroken memories always fade\nLive on and you will find a way\nThings will be okay, don't be afraid\nLive on and you will find a way", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e962334e64ea4f814fb520d8bae77334.742x742x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
