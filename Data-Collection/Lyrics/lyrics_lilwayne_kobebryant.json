Smith]\nHe's the best player in the game\nIt's just that simple\nThere's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do\nHe will defend your best player\nHe will shoot from the perimeter\nHe will get all in yo mug\nHe will do whatever it takes\nHe is the most complete basketball player\nIn the game today - bar none\nHe has an assassin's mentality\nI said this week, I said this when the trade went down\nAnd I will repeat it again\nWho's starving more for an NBA World Championship\nMore than Kobe Bryant\nThere is no one\nThis guy is highly motivated\nWhat separates Kobe from the pack\nMore than Kobe Bryant, there is no one\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]\nKobe doin' work\n2-4 on my shirt\nHe the greatest on the court\nAnd I'm the greatest on the verse\nGoing for the fourth ring like it was his first\nGotta get the bling\nDo it for Kareem\nTwo-four so nice, my flow so mean\nCatch me at the game sitting next to Goldestein\nKobe Bryant Nikes, purple gold strings\nKobe in the game dunkin' on the whole team\nBlack Mamba, attack conquer\nBasketball beast, rap monster\nCrossover good, a turnaround jumper\nOr just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers\nYou know where it's goin', it's goin' down yo\nThis is the Lakeshow, but don't drown though\nI call him King Bryant, now let the crown show\n\n[Interlude: LeBron James]\nI'm definitely, I'm just lost for words\nI mean, he's amazing\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nPass me the damn ball\nI don't need a pick at all\nAnd don't worry 'bout my shot\nCause I'mma get that off\nYea, I drops 40 on your double team\nThen I drop 81 on another team\nYeah, you better guard me with caution\nAnd watch I work 'em like a auction\nNo such thing as exhaustion\nNo time for resting\nCause I don't take breaks\nI just break records\nAnd I prefer the ball with 3 seconds\nAnd I bet we gon' win it all in 3 seconds\nYa dig\nThat is a guarantee\nApparently\nAnd please tell your defense\nDon't ever man to man with me\nDouble team, triple team\nYour defenders sick of me\nBut, I never let 'em get to me\nLiterally\nStep back and give 'em a three\nAin't no defending me\n\n[Interlude 2: LeBron James]\nOne guy certainly envious of the way Bryant's playing lately, LeBron James\n\nI've been quoted saying that\nHe's definitely the best player in our league\nUm, to me, in my eyes\nThe best scorer in our league\nAnd there's not another guy in our league\nThat can accomplish some of the things\nThat he's doing\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nNever take a day off\nCatch you at the top of the key\nAnd get a J off\nBaseline face time\nTongue out like two-three\nEven two-three gotta love how I do me\nPractice while you sleep\nPractice in my sleep\nStraight outta high school\nTha brackets ain't for me\nI will be jumpin' over you\nLike I got a mattress at my feet\nAnd all the Phil Jackson say teams\nBetter be passin' it to me\nI put the master in the piece\nAttack you like a beast\nI am starvin' for victory\nAnd that means I'mma eat\nAnd when they ask you who's the best\nThen the answer should be me\n\n[Interlude 3: Elie Seckbach/Mikael Pietrus]\nSeckbach: Who's the best player in the NBA\nMikael: Um, I'll say Kobe Bryant\nSeckback: Really? Why\nMikael: Because you never know what you're gonna get!\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]\nCall me Mr. Clutch or Mr. Automatic\nI can post 'em up, or Lamar go get the alley\nI'm going for the ring\nI'm going for the ring\nI went to Beijing\nAnd came back with the bling\nWho they want\nThey want Kobe\nAnd what he want\nHe want the trophy\nThe victory\nAnd the glory\nNo Shaq\nNo Robert Horry\nNow break 'em off, Kobe break 'em off\nYou better be where that Laker don't\nYea, just give him the ball and he take it off\nOr he properly dishing it to Gasol\nOr give it to D-Fish on the wing, yeah\nOr just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah\nCause I'm great, and so is my team, yeah\n[I thought you want to be the greatest]\nDo it for Magic\nIt's your time baby\nI see nothin' wrong with doin' it four times baby\nI'm the best yes\nAnd he the best yeah\nDon't worry LeBron - get 'em next year\nNow what's defense\nTo an assassin\nKiller instinct\nMurder the basket\nThen steal the ball back\nHold it for ransom\nIt's more than a game\nThis is a passion\nBeen a all-star, been a champion\nFree throw line, you hear 'em chanting\nMVP, MVP\nKobe Bryant aka Envy Me\nIn knee deep, smash any D\nWhoever he is he can't guard me\nHe can't guard me\n\n[Outro: Elie Seckbach]\n\"So, there you have it. The overwhelming answer was ... Kobe Bryant\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f903dae2533e450c8d3cb233aa846020.745x745x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
