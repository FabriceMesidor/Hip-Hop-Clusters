Of course it is!\nI'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit\nAnd scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)\nAnd tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to\nI'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)\nThen claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine\nAnd then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics\nIf I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it\nAnd tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Cryptic Wisdom]\nIf I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it\nI'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas\nAnd blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match\nDig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket\nAnd shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing\nI'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle\nI cut up within my labor\nTake a breather, make a haste of it and bounce\nToward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out\nAnd take em down\nTell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is\nGrab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back\nLeave it all and still ready me a new blood bath\nRun back to the psyche ward\nCheck my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy\n\n[Verse 3: SwizZz]\nYo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue\nBut if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do\nI'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View\nPicturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!\nI'll throw babies in dryers\nStrangle tweakers that fidgit\nContract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it\nI'd mug mothers on wellfare\nSwim in gallons of gas\nMeander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)\nIf I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain\nMake it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change\nMake her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand\nLick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)\nHonestly I'd be itching for gunplay\nI'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday\nI'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway\nGrope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!\n\n[Hook]\nBut I'm not crazy\nI'm just a tad bit strange\nI can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain\nOh no, not my fault\nSo don't blame me\nI swear to you that I'm not really crazy\n(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
