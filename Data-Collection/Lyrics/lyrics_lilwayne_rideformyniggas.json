I'm from New Orleans\nThe majority of my city is riders\nThey tried to make a brand new map without us\nBut the tourists come down and spend too many dollars\nAnd no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas\nMost likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger\nDon't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit\nThe sky is the limit, the sky is the limit\nAnd I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit\nBecause the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit\nAnd if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it\n'Cause the sky is the limit\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd you don't want to fuck with a soldier\nUse your head or I'll take it off your shoulder\nRun up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting\nOn the living room sofa\n(That's fucked up, haha)\nAnd you don't want to fuck with a soldier\nUse your head or I'll take it off your shoulder\nMail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses\n(Hah, now that's fucked up)\nAnd I'm a G\nAnd you ain't got to know the alphabets to see\nI know my whole city is depending on me\nAnd I forget a lot of shit but I cannot forget the street\n\n[Hook]\nSo you know that I'mma ride with my motherfucking niggas\nMost likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger\nDon't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit\nThe sky is the limit\nDon't worry about mine, I'mma grind 'til I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit\n\n[Outro]\nBecause the sky is the limit, yeah the sky is the limit\nAnd if you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it\n'Cause the sky is the limit\nThey tell me don't get high and I should try to make a living\nI tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing\n'Cause the sky is the limit\nHands up in the air, because the sky is the limit\nCan you see me up there? The sky is the limit\nThe sky is the limit\nIf you don't remember nothing, man, the sky is the limit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82588434bc5c5032b1e49dee6403c736.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
