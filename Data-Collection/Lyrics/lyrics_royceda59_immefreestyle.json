I'm just kidding\nI just threw that in there to get y'all attention\nNo intention of ever dying, nigga, life too sweet\nTwo words for who don't like me, \"fight\" and \"me\"\nI take care of my family\nThey say, \"Do the kid rock like Pam Lee?\"\nThe answer is yes! (Yes!)\nAnd I invest, it takes money to make money\nSo I make green off Green like Stan Lee\nSmart shit, I ain't got beef with no Joe Budden\nY'all gon' get one of these niggas killed tryna start shit\nNiggas hired muscle 'cause living is a privilege\nThe only rapper I admire for his strength is Xzibit\n\n[Interlude]\nIt's an invasion!\nI'm me, nigga\nGreen Lantern, drop that shit!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI killed it, right away\nSoon as you cross, go 'head, you got the right-a-way\nGive a nigga iron like vitamin, play\nI will ride up in broad day and night a nigga day (Brrrrat!)\nDrunk! I'm a recovering outpatient\nYou at the top, you shot, your spot is now taken\nPsychotic is the ploy, how the fuck you rapping and you gay?\nAnd you've been spotted with a boy like a Dalmatian?\nIf I switch up, I'd probably be instantly selling\nGot a clip full of pellets known as MC repellent\nWhile you talkin' 'bout your money and I can't have none of it\nI'll hit a nigga low, just for the Zab fun of it\nI will never lose, never lost, I'ma prove it\nExcept for my virginity, but I was tryna lose it\nI be on some Tom Cruise shit\nStanding on the couch in the club\nLaughing bout my dime new chick (Oh!)\nShe the shit, but if you ask her she useless\nI'm in her pocket\n'Cause I got a rocket down under like Houston\nSo I'm gonna keep being me and you should keep being you\nIf being you offends me, indeed, it's gonna be me and you\nBut understand that if it's that, it's either gonna be me or you\nSo pump your brakes before I do you like a got a key to you\nShut your power off, I'm G-A-N-G\nS-T-ARR, yes, we are, bitch, I'm *gunshot*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b0c99ea857e85f30c22aa344281f869.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
