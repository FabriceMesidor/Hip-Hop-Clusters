break it apart\nKush on my clothes, smell the green in my car\nAin't coming close, you smell me from afar\nTime after time, I keep smoking that herb\nJoint after joint, I must be on the verge\nOf overdosing, I be on that loud\nSpeeding me up, while I'm slowing you down\nI just got back from an overseas trip\nSmoking with Ty, he got me high as shit\nCause we keep nothing but good in our J\nRepping our gang and we mob everyday\nBreak down an ounce, put it right on a tray\nAin't saving nothing, we smoke everything\nLight up a joint, let it stink up the place\nOr hit the bong, blow the smoke in your face\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nI'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money\nI'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nI'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money\nI'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\n\n[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]\nBreak it down and roll another one, I could get anything I want\nI told her \"You should bring a friend for the crew\" (friend for the crew)\nHear 'em talk but they ain't want it though, I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke\n'Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too (get high too)\nOnly rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper (Khalifa paper)\nTaylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor (smell the vapor)\nTake it to the head before I walk up to the plane\nI'll probably get so fucking high\nWon't even know my fucking name\nYou got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow\nNever inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke\nAnd I'm never running out of it (running out of it)\nKush smoke, got a lot of it (got a lot of it)\nSmoke like we hit the lottery (hit the lottery)\nSeen Snoop, he was proud of me (he was proud of me)\nWon't go broke 'cause I never spend (never spend)\nIf them hoes don't smoke, don't let 'em in (don't let 'em in)\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nI'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money\nI'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nI'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money\nI'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real\nAnd I love getting high\n(love getting high)\nAnd I love getting high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/329866c1bd0be13efe2300615c0293e5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz
