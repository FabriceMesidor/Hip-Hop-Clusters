I can't believe he's that rude\nTo those stories, those rhymes, that Jew\nThen he put 'em on the floor like cat food\nAnd put 'em on the track like glue\nThen put 'em on your head like hat, hey back to you, Lu\nBlack power, I'm just runnin' with a barrel full of black powder\nWith a hole in it holdin' it wheezin' deep, breathin'\nRunnin' from the fire on the trail I keep leavin'\nI can't shake it, I swear it's heat seekin', I keep seekin'\nSomewhere to hide from it, duck and dive from it\nBut it keep keepin' up, just when I think that I've done it\nIt keep sneakin' up, oh, leakin' barrel of black powder\nHow that flame keep reachin' us?\nJust one of the long-winded, extended metaphors of Lu's\nThis time I use an example of a fuse to demonstrate\nHow I can't lose, I would put it down\nBut I can't due to the glue that I use to fuse\nEverything together, well, I spilt some on my hands\nAnd goddamn, I might have to carry this forever\nWell I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane\n\n[Refrain]\nThere once was a boy that grew up on the west side\nOf Chicago, liked his hat to the left side\nWasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang\nDoin' his thang, doin' his thang\nThere once was a boy that grew up on the west side\nOf Chicago liked his hat to the left side\nWasn't in a gang but he was known to bang like\nDoin' his thang, doin' his thang\n\n[Verse 2]\nTruthfully, I have trouble with second verses\nCause the first one be so intimidatin', it be bullyin'\nPickin on it, instigatin', pointin' out all the second one's limitations\nLike, \"You ain't nothin but a imitation, like, bits o' bacon\nThen he gets the chorus and the beat to get together\nThen they all gang up on him and get to hatin'\nBut then around the eighth bar he tires of their conspirin'\nCommiseratin, then he finds his inspiration\nTo spar, he takes a few seconds of judo lessons\nGets back on beat, then punches the guitar\nThey stand in awe, like, \"When did you write that?\"\nThey ain't even right, black, first verse already happened\nSo he don't have a chance to fight back, I like that\nAbagnale Junior, check me, you gon' respect me\nAight, 'Trakk, listen to him, feelin' himself\nSwagger up and a few ad-libs to back it up (woo!)\nLet's back it up, I think you've had enough\nGive me my mic back, you ain't even write that\nOh, it's like that?, 'Trakk, stop pumpin'\n'Til this nigga stop frontin',, yeah, yeah, now right back\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh my God, my perils and my odds\nI ain't really here, what you hear is a mirage\nThis ain't the delivery, baby, this is just Lamaze\nThe ice cream and pickles, the tickle and a massage\nThe King Arthur, rhythm of the night, El DeBarge\nThe camouflage water in the distance, flogging a camel\nTo get there with the quickness, mean and vicious\nGrinch Who Stole Christmas and hid it in the garage\nThat was a collage, a barrage, I brought all things\nThat seem keen to help this thing start\nJump, jump, my battery charge\nI'm bout my green like string beans and beings from Mars\nIts a mean thing to be seen with ours\nGot that F&F on me, I'm a young lil' thriller\nI will resurrect, homie, come back for my killa\nIn some disheveled apparel with that same leakin' barrel, it's on\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Outro]\nIt's meaaaaan, and vicious", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbe43b56e43c0bf22c2ad2f2bce13dd0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
