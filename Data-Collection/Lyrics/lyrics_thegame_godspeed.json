Don't lie to me\n'Cause I'm Donald Trumpin,' Feds trying to eye on me\nAin't no limit in spending this money I'm bout it bout it P\nI'm who these new rappers trying to be\nEvery new nigga that say 'five' becomes a prodigy\nAnd you should honor me, hang my jersey up? Sure!\nWe got a situation, nigga Jersey shore\nKnow I'm 'bout my occupation, know I'm 'bout fucking these hoes\nKnow I rock them Louboutins and smoke til its stuck on my clothes\nAnd I got your girl in her comfortable clothes\nI'm 'bout to tickle her with what's right up under my nose\nIts money gang bitch, now watch my company blow\nAnd go from a hot logo to something you know\nI'm in the Maserati, Jordans punching the floor\nAnd you can act like you don't nigga, but...\n\n[Ending Verse: Mele]\nEither I'm going too fast or doing too much\nShut it down all the time when I'm in the club\nOoohhhh, ooohhhh\nYeah I'm always in the zone chilling with a bad bitch\nAnd she got nothing on, yeah I'm gonna do it, shut it down\nYeah I'm going too fast, so fast....", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6b76fdc2635fdc0e9d62ceb9907eb3c.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
