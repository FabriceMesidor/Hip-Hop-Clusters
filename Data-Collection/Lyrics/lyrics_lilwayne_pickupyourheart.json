there\nShe wasn't there again today\nI really hope she go away\n(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody\nAnd I don't want to do it no more)\nCause you know, sometimes \"at last\" doesn't happen at first\nI'm the pimp and the problem\nShe said \"You don't think of me when I know you think too much\"\n(I don't want to do it no more\nThese hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody\nAnd I don't want to do it no more)\nShe said \"I think you think I think you think of us\"\n(I'mma get this paper baby, I'mma get this paper baby)\nShe said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners\nFree Weezy\nMula", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22c3b68c0f49bb742b34148131ca933d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
