Me\n\nBig money, small money\nShort money, tall money\n\n[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]\nSoon after we locked eyes\nI had a vision of me inside\nI stimulate your mind and give your body everything that it wants\nPrivate school her whole life\nGot an infatuation with being bad\nYou take her out to shop\nTo spend it all cause she don't see those tags\nI get deep inside her soul though\nIf she was a guitar I'd treat her like a solo\nAnd put my fingers through your hair\nAnd last night was amazing I can honestly say that you the best I ever had\nAnd you don't remember cause you weren't even there..\nBut your soul was..\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nKeep going..\n\nJust.. just catch up with the next one..\n\nAy..\nAy Ay..\nAy..\n\nWe don't make love I touch your soul girl.. *laugh*\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nShe don't party where the rest go\nYou need to be able to let your hair down so you can feel good..\nHere you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car, purchase the Louis bags on your own\nHer parents money long but since she grown she'd rather spend yours..\nI get deep inside her soul though\nGo into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo..\nUntil you think it's to much..\nAnd even though now you figuring out how or what we shouldn't did..\nTo your friends you'll admit that we had fun.. okay..\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nAy Ay..\nAy Ay..\n\n[Verse 1: John Record]\nLet's ride to the gate so you can meet the man..\nCall me Peter Pan I'mma take you to never never land..\nWhen your all dried up here's an ocean to wet the sand..\nOf course I'mma see what's good with your physical..\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nI'm relighting in the dark to her lock I got the key\nAnd niggas down to get a copy..\nDamn..\nHow does it feel this great when your not even here..\nAnd you climax with the thought of me\nThat mean we gotta be..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/87ca659a586e891811e781b44890aa4a.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
