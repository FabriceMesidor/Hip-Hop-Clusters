And what's good evil?\nAnd what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?\nAnd why God phone die every time that I call on Him?\nIf his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him\nSwallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon\nKeep all them sentiments down to a minimum\nStudious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him\nPics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em\nI slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot\nI got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock\nYou what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues\nWe invented rock before the Stones got through\nWe just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you\nBuck buck, bang bang, yelling \"Fuck Fox News\"\nBooyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too\nAin't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool\n\n[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]\nNice to see you, Father New Year\nMiddle finger Uncle Samuel\nShooting death with weighted dice\nAnd hitting stains on birthday candles\nI know somebody, somebody loves my ass\n'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nI know you right\nNobody's nothing\nThat's right\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nThat's right\nNobody's nothing, nobody's nothing (Right?

Maybe I'm adopted\nThat'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh\n\n[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & BJ the Chicago Kid]\nEverybody's somebody's everything, nigga\nNobody's nothing, nigga\nEverybody's somebody's everything, nigga\nNobody's nothing at all\nWu-Tang\nEverybody's somebody's everything\nThat's right\nNobody's nothing\nI know you're right", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aa16cba40f43828a61bbb6212de712bd.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
