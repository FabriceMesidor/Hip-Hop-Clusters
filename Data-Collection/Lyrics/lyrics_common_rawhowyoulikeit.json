I came through the door\nWith the raw Martin Margiela\nSuperstar status, everything stellar\nWith some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers\nNiggas already jealous\nWe in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers\nShe already wanna pick, bitch don't be so over zealous\nGo to the bar to get around like a propeller\nThe barmaid's name is Stella\nI'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me\nAm I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party\nWanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah\nNiggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah\nSeen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah\nWanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha\nHmmmm! Well let me take my time\nShe ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight\nSeen that ass cause I got hindsight\nShe was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight\n'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt\nShe said \"You rap?\" Yea mummy\nI'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money\n\n[Hook]\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\n\n[Bridge]\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was all couture, in a Tom Ford\nSecurity guard let me in cause I'm lord\nOf finesse, the under, the rings, the dress\nCode is to always stay fresh\nAware of a chest cause I stay abreast\nShe was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest\nThis nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess\nKnocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled\nI'm locked into my mood, long as dude don't disturb my groove\nI won't have to take it back to high school\nRewind! No need to take me back in time\nKeep my mind on the grind and the great feline\nCause what's in front of me is this behind\nUp north, she's thick; down south she's fine\nTuned in to what I'm doing\nI'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing\nThe ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade\nShowing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me\nSaw me talking to slim and started acting shady\nDude got foul like crack in the 80s\nUh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo\nYou never know who got a Tec up in the disco\n\"You Hollywood.\" Nah nigga, I'm Chicago\nSo I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle\n\n[Hook]\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\nFeels so good\nI wanna touch somebody\nSo let's go, go\nWanna feel you close, keep touching\n\n[Bridge]\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it\nLa la la la la, how you like it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c8aea6a11c5d9bc44d2a6101d96d5aed.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
