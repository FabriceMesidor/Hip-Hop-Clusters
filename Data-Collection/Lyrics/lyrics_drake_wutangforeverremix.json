ten\nWe used to be friends, girl, and even back then\nYou would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that\nWhat made me think about the game, girl\nAnd how I switched it up with a new thing\nYoung nigga came through on his Wu-Tang\nAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure\n\n[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]\nTongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella\nThank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her\nNot only could I do better, but I know better\nHow could I ever be the king without a Coretta?\nFeelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater\nMAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather\nHer ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter\nHoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better\nMachine gun raps for all my niggas in the back\nKeep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up\nPetite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us\nMachine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough\nAin't nothin' like a bad bitch\nThat make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw\nLike Bruh Man from the 5th floor\nI creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, \"It's yours\"\nI know this shit is mine for the takin'\nIf I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit\nProlly why I don't react when you say shit\nHalf the times niggas don't even make sense\nKnow this shit is yours\nWhen you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit\nYou know this shit is yours\nWhen your face on every magazine cover, every page shit\nYou know this shit is yours\nWhen you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit\nOnly get high just to compliment my maintenance\nI took a little moment out to say this\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten\nWe used to be friends, girl, and even back then\nYou would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that\nWhat made me think about the game, girl\nAnd how I switched it up with a new thing\nYoung nigga came through on his Wu-Tang\nAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure\n\n[Bridge: Drake]\nHow you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?\nIf you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite\nCause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good\nThen I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nMachine gun raps for all my niggas in the back\nStadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map\nI just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first\nIt's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like \"Preach\"\nOpen cases on me for a half a million each\nI find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know\nLuckily I didn't have to grow there\nI would only go there cause niggas that I know there\nI don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush\nWhen you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize\nHe just not in a position to reciprocate your energy\nYou ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be\nPeople like Mazin who was a best friend to me\nStart to become a distant memory, things change in that life\nAnd this life started lacking synergy\nAnd fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be\nParanoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys\nBut you gotta understand when it's yours\nThey don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten\nWe used to be friends, girl, and even back then\nYou would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that\nWhat made me think about the game, girl\nAnd how I switched it up with a new thing\nYoung nigga came through on his Wu-Tang\nAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure", "image":
