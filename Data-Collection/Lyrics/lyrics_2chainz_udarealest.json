Just left the dealership\nPull your girl off my car, that's that whip appeal\nI'm 'bout to milk the game, Enfamil\nHit the girl with my two's, Benadryl\n\n[Hook]\nI'm like a quarterback, watch me hand it off\nDrop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball\nI done seen 'em ball, I done seen 'em fall\nRest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg\nYou da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg\nYou da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg\nYou da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg\nYou da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/UMG_cvrart_00602537507474_01_RGB72_1500x1500_13UAAIM70647.1200x1200-75.jpg"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
