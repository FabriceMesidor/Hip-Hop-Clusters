(No)\nDo these bitches make me filthy?\nYeah, rich that is\nI had a good night, my bitch got tricks (Get it)\nI ain't talkin' 'bout playin' games\nReal pimp shit, I ain't sayin' names\nWe goin' straight to the top\nI'm still pimpin', I tried to stop\nI told my mama, \"I won't pimp no more\"\nThen I took your bitch, and I sent your ho\nI thought about the promise I made\nLyin' to my momma 'bout how I got paid (Pimpin')\nI told her my bitches was singers\nSigned to my label, I was crossin' my fingers\nWhen I lied about my women\nI didn't want to see her cry, but I can't stop pimpin' (Bitch)\n\n[Chorus]\nBack in the day, we ain't give a ho shit\nNowadays all these niggas do is trick\nPay her (Pay her), pay her (Pay her)\nPay her, what happened to the players?

Playa\n\n[Verse 3]\nI always got stacks of hunds\nMy bitch better make 20 racks a month (She better)\nAnd when I got shows to do\nI knock bitches, and my hoes recruit\nI need cash, I gotta have it\nI love gettin' money, I can't kick the habit (I can't kick it)\nI'm not hooked on drugs\nBut I hang out with a lotta crooks and thugs (From The Town)\nI never sold dope\nBut I'd sell my bitch to the pope\nAin't no hope (Can't save me), you can't save me momma\nThey won't stop, I get paid 'cause they wanna\nGive daddy, all that dough\nAnd if a trick mothafucka don't call my ho\nShe'll put two feet down on the pavement (On the pavement)\nOr I'll drag her by the hair like a caveman (Like a caveman)\n\n[Chorus]\nBack in the day, we ain't give a ho shit\nNowadays all these niggas do is trick\nPay her (You better pay her), pay her (You better pay her)\nPay her, what happened to the players? (What happened to 'em?)\nWhen I was comin' up, real macks said \"Fuck it\"\nNowadays, y'all put these hoes in the budget\nPay her (Pay that bitch), pay her (Pay the bitch)\nPay her, what happened to the players?
