No, you can\u2019t stop it\nBecause I\u2019m destined to win\nLike a full champion\nAnd we know it\u2019s happening\nAt the time, get ready, set, go\n\n(Verse)\nOn your mark, get set, when I start the jet\nLook how far I get, I\u2019m not only an artist they say\nOne is the loneliest number but still regardless\nThe second best don\u2019t exist, it\u2019s a little oxymoronic\nWhat a thought, listen to haters and never buy to hitting high\nWatermarks, cause the market\u2019s flooded with garbage\nYou are now embraced by the light with fiber optic\nShine it bright love, get a ten or wind tropic\nPrisoner of conscious, nonsense\nI can say the conscious is asleep, I prefer the call of the wake\nIt\u2019s so ironic, it\u2019s beautiful when you finally get awake at your funeral\nWe don\u2019t get it away\nRappers nowadays are confusing you\nI know you\u2019re tired of the usual like Trey Songz and Drake\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m leaping the faith, keeping the pace\nAlthough it\u2019s all about the winning, it\u2019s never about the wait\n\n(Hook)\nLife\u2019s so short, we can\u2019t afford to lose\nWhen the guns go off and the flag drops\nI\u2019ll never stop\nI'mma race to the finish line of the road\nTo kick in the door\nReady, set, go\nReady, set, go\nReady, set, go\nReady, set, go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70850ebf7e5891df63851f2a86ecec08.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
