(Yeah)\n'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions\nThat's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house\nAnd collapse the foundation around you and they found you\nAnd your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHe's mentally ill from Amityville\nHe'll accidentally kill your family still\nThinkin' he won't, goddammit he will\nHe's mentally ill from Amityville\nHe's mentally ill from Amityville\nHe'll accidentally kill your family still\nThinkin' he won't, goddammit he will\nHe's mentally ill from Amityville\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum; ta-dah-da\nDum", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7f2305258d668431f8e250a41f3459f.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
