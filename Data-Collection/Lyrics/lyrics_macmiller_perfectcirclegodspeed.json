Just for something to do\nCan you draw a perfect circle?\nLot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?\nI wash these pills down with liquor and fall\nLeave it to me, I do enough for us all (I do)\nGot what you need if you like breaking the law\nMy mother raised me a God (Hey)\n(Fuck you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday\nDrunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway\nGiving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase\nHidden in a subwoofer, beat case\nUsed to wanna know how a freak taste\nNow I\u2019m in it in an instant like replay\nBroad\u2019s a baton, pass it off like relay\nWhy I\u2019m so mad on my B-Day?\nShe say \u201cI thought you got sober\u201d\nAnd I say \u201cI wish you\u2019d stop being a bitch\nAnd get to minding your business\u201d\nTold me \u201cMoney has changed you\u201d\nI get to thinking, how rarely do I visit?\nHow\u2019d I get so egotistical? I\u2019m a Buffalo Soldier\nHeaven is a mile away, the trouble, much closer\nI\u2019m only twenty-three but my mind is older, and it\u2019ll forever be\nDead presidents to the homies, death to my enemies\n\n[Chorus]\nMurder, murder, murder, murder, what would you do?\nHave you ever had to hurt her? Just for something to do\nCan you draw a perfect circle?\nLot of lies cover the truth, you got options, what do you do?\nI wash these pills down with liquor and fall\nLeave it to me, I do enough for us all\nGot what you need if you like breaking the law\nMy mother raised me a God (Hey)\n(Fuck you)\n\n[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]\nA goddess told me \u201cgood morning\u201d when I woke up\n(Fuck you)\nYou know I had a good morning when I woke up\n(Fuck you)\nGotta thank God every morning then I woke up\n(Fuck you)\nWould you remember me if I never woke up?\nBye bye (Fuck you)\nI've been a sinner, I\u2019m just tryna stay\nWarm through the winter, and I\u2019ll be on my way\nI\u2019m just a drifter, in endless seas of whispers\nI just need some shelter, give me shelter from the wind\n\n[Refrain]\nWoo-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh\nWoo-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh\n\n[Interlude: Transition]\nYour call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system\n412-9\u2026.
