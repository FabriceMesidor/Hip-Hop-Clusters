God don't know\nIt's all a joke to him, watching how hard we grow\nDeath don't kissy you when god say it\nSort of like that little whistle in Broadway\nOur way, Plant workers on lines, beeper stores\nHealth care, fuck potholes we got deeper sores\nReaped with wars\nMy man young to kill Patrick\nDexter is lovely ain't it? I'm still at it\nI fill my hand with Mr. Man and Tone-Loc\nWhen the lights burnt out in them grown folk\nMy bone broke\nTo lift this pen\nLet me jot this down and get this in\nWhen I'm gone I hope y'all respect me then\nLet me jot this down and get this in\nWhen I'm dead and gone I hope y'all respect me then\nI'm gone\n\n[Hook](Repeat X2)\n\n[Outro: Dolo]\nYo man\nI did a lot in my life, man\nI'd buried a lot of niggas\nA lot of posers went to jail\nThe streets are wicked out there\nFuck all the nightmares\nTry my best\nThe only thing I left back there\nIt's all\nMy Life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/28ff9193e1357f6fde4a825e763f7ce0.593x593x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Proof"}
