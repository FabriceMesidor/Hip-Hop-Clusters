Ugh\n\n[Verse 1]\nI just burnt my American flag\nAnd sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad\nUgh, I'm loading tips in my Mag'\nTo send these redneck bigots some death in a bag\nChoke him out with his confederate flag\nI know these devils are mad\nLittle rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia\nWould you stand with me, a United States murdurer?\n\n[Chorus]\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nHuh? Would you testify?\nYou buy my songs\nYou buy my songs\nBut will you ride with me?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nYou understand my struggle\nThat's what you claim right?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nThen get your aim right\nAnd get your game tight\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it\nComing to concerts singing ho and shit\nFuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches\nI don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it\nI heard y'all was downloading it, heh\nLike I'm y'all man who be exposing shit, heh\nLike ah, William Cooper\nWho told you the Pale Horse is the future\n\n[Chorus]\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nWould you testify on some realness like that?\nI think you scared (heh)\nI don't think you prepared\nYeah\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nYou know what I'm asking you?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nDo we know what I'm asking you?
