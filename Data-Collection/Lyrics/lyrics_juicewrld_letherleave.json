What are you, a goalie?\nStartin' to feel the fame, don't know how to maintain it\nYou could be my heart even though that love's dangerous\nLoner by choice I don't talk to strangers\nHold my hand I'ma walk with danger\nAnd she cheated, put a knife to her throat, I'll slay her\n\n[Chorus]\nHer love isn't free\nHad to pay a fee\nWe don't get along, let's agree to disagree\nLove ain't meant for me\nI'm not meant for love\nOnly meant for drugs\nKissing on the lean\nI get so damn high let it sweep me off my feet, bitch\nEvery time I'm high, I be as happy as can be, bitch\nBut on the inside I'm sad, I'ma let it bleed\nShouldn't have let her leave, shouldn't have let her leave\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby I won't kill you that was just exaggeration\nOr maybe it was real I'm super high and super angry\nThe way you left those scratches on my back you got me anxious\nCupid got an automatic and it keep on aimin'\nI really got my eyes on you, no blinkin'\nAnd I got my mind on you, no thinkin'\nWasting all my time on you, I'm tweakin'\nEven though I'm in hell, my heart is freezin'\n\n[Chorus]\nHer love isn't free\nHad to pay a fee\nWe don't get along, let's agree to disagree\nLove ain't meant for me\nI'm not meant for love\nOnly meant for drugs\nKissing on the lean\nI get so damn high let it sweep me off my feet, bitch\nEvery time I'm high, I be as happy as can be, bitch\nBut on the inside I'm sad, I'ma let it bleed\nShouldn't have let her leave, shouldn't have let her leave", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
