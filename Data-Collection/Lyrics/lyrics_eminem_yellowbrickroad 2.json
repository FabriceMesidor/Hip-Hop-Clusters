X Clan debuted\nProfessor X (Vanglorious!) \"Exist in a state of red\nBlack and green, with a key, sissies!\"\nNow with this being the new trend, we don't fit in\nCrackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in\nAfrican symbols and medallions represent Black Power\nAnd we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard\nAnd Butter would go to the mall\nWith 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off\nNot knowin' at all we was being laughed at\n\"You ain't even half black! You ain't 'posed to have that\nHomie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock\nWe gon' have to snatch that!\" All I remember is meeting back at\nManix's basement, sayin' how we hate this\nHow racist but dope the X Clan's tape is\nWhich reminds me, back in '89, me\nAnd Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me\nAnd there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool\n\u2018Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me\nAnd oh the irony, guess what her name was?\nAin't even gonna say it, plus\nThe same color hair as hers was and blue contacts\nAnd a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn\nGirl in our whole school, if I could pull her, not only would I become\nMore popular, but I would be able to piss Kim off\nAt the same time, but it backfired\nI was supposed to dump her, but she dumped me for this black guy\nAnd that's the last I ever seen or heard\nOr spoke to the \"Ole Foolish Pride\" girl, but I've heard\nPeople say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad\nBut it was: I singled out a whole race\nAnd for that I apologize, I was wrong\n\u2018Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a\u2014\n\n[Hook]\nSo, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road\nAs we go on another episode\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\nThat I once used to call home sweet home\nCome on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road\nAs we go on another episode\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\nThat I once used to call home sweet home\n\n[Outro: Debbie Mathers]\nFuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!\nGet the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!\nYou son of a bitch!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e76120b9dd2c0af6f1b3f8d3dcbe11d2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
