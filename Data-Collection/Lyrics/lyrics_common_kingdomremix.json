They know me on the streets where I grew\nIf you ain\u2019t from around here you get gunned down here\nMake the best from the least on the quest for them keys\nTo the kingdom\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]\nNas hit me up on the phone like \"Peace, Isa\nYou know you need to preach how the pyramids of Giza\nAlone condemn Easter\nInstead of sniffing lines, popping thongs in Ibiza, Ether\nNigga, are we not thy brother's keeper?\"\nAllahu Akbar, abracadabra\nWe used what we had to stay alive like MacGyver\nStarted from the bottom, now we really, really here\nStarted kinda blurry, now we really, really clear\nIt's the Nat King unforgettable, black king on a pedestal\nThe way he made words into edibles was incredible\nVerbs and spices, giving life out to the lifeless\nGiving Christ out to the Christ-less\nMy handle with the dices been documented as priceless\nI roll 7's naturally\nDevils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally\nRappers I gave birth to shot at the God, blasphemy\nTold these motherfuckers to never Jimmy DeGrassi me\nThis goes out to those that choose to use\nDisrespectful views on original Jews\nThe chosen people of God getting slandered and abused\nIn the streets and the news by the seed of Yakub\nThe synagogues of Satan wanna keep us confused\nThat's how we lose, niggas got the ill street blues\nFrom Chiraq to England\nMe and Common dropping bombs like the baby planes as we establish the kingdom", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dca0dc1680990e772c2f4ed48ddf1cd2.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
