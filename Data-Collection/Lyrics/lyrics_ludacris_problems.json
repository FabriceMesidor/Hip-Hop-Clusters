But I'm trying to be the man I plan to be\nBut can't do it if you calling me for dumb shit\nThinking I'm innocent, I'm a plea insanity\nToo many distractions and it feels like everyday\nSo I get down on my knees and pray and I say\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away\nI wish my problems would go away, away, away\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nI finally made it to the top of the CEO position\nBut when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions\nSo the weed keep me at peace, and I think I need an intervention\nWho the fuck put me in charge of making all of these decisions\nMy position got me stressing, like it never did before\nNot to mention my best friend drowned and death was knocking at his door\nAnd it seems like someone in my family is passing away like every day\nSo I just look up to the sky and get down on my knees and pray and I say\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away\n(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away\nI wish my problems would go away, away, away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62819740802d113d74cdf35e32db7990.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
