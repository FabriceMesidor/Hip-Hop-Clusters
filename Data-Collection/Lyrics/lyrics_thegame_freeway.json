Yeah when you born worthless\nCatch the bus to Beverly Hills and snatch purses\nPreachers call us serpents, when they worship, so it\u2019s us against them\nLet the steam hit the skin when that pot working\nFrom random tears to chandeliers\nPouring 40s for my peers, but my enemies\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in\nWalking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in\nShooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them\nEmpty out the clip then I\u2019m hopping on that 110\nFreeway, that i10 freeway\nTo that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I\u2019m on that 105 freeway\nHeaded to that 710 freeway\nChickens on the move, nigga it\u2019s a relay\nI got them unmarked bills in that briefcase with that new face in that blue tape\nThrowing Wingstop up out my window\nYou don\u2019t like my flow, I guess it\u2019s time to switch the tempo\nI can pull a model bitch inside a Pinto, fresh as Mentos\nWhere you get them Js? Jordan sent those\nGot my Glock cocked \u2018case a nigga think he fit those\nGet his shit blowed, like it\u2019s endo, over them custom kicks though\nHeart been cold, hot chain been froze, but it\u2019s plated in gold\nRide around in those\nRed Octobers in July, you got 'em, you lie, in red puddles\nPeyton Manning with the cannon, nigga no huddle\nNo rebuttal, when you the king of the square, it\u2019s no trouble\nWhen the city love you\nBut them haters nigga\n\n[Hook]\nI\u2019ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in\nWalking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in\nShooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them\nEmpty out the clip then I\u2019m hopping on that 110\nFreeway, that i10 freeway\nTo that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3f4fc097719794050d92c29bcdec825.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
