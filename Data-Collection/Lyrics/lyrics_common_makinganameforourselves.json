I'm bad to the bone marrow\nThe Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows\nWith Allah, my supernatural bodyguard\nNiggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage\nMC's will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed\nI'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch\nWhat?\n\n[Scratching]\n\"Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron\"\n\"I ain't scared of no nigga\"\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nI pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair\nOther nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs\nOn knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet\nSupposedly nice, taken for granted like life\nI write twice and drop singles in record pools\nNiggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle\nFuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit\nThe clique that you came in with accent your flavor with\nLike moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours\nI'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for\nFar more advanced than a rapper whose career\nYou could only take a glance\nCouldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance\nI stand in a circumference of humbleness\nBut in the Chi rumble it's\nMistaken as a weakness, when poetry's in motion\nLike a picture, I'm the main feature\nAmongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers\nI make my living off of singles like Latifah\nIn between sheets like reefer with blunted senses\nYou couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence\nI'm cold with numb intentions\n\n[Scratching]\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Fucking with Canibus\"\n\"Yo, sick with it\"\n\n[Verse 4: Canibus]\nYo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible\nComing to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you\nI be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral\nWith three-hundred sixty degree visual\nWhen the signal was given, MC's get bitten\nWith venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em\nMy style will get in 'em, way up in 'em\nMy face don't belong in The Source, it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain\nI grab mics and murder shit\nIt's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services\nYou heard of this, the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist\nThe wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless\nRap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps\nContaminate your air sacs like tear gas\nAnd I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last\nI'll turn your ass into \"The Artist Formerly Known As\"\nYou gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics\nStrip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard\nSo fat to be a rap star, taking pictures at music seminars\nPeople know who you are\nNow I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me\nUp in The Source chilling on page forty\nPut this in your CD-ROM\nWWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com\nYou can find me on the internet talking to chicks\nThat was sweating me off the \"Music Makes Me High\" remix\nI be talking mad trash, trying to get 'em to laugh\nSee, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass\nBring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave\nLet your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab\nYou know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2\nBeasts from the East part two, coming to see you\n\n[Hook: Common and Canibus]\nIt's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear\nY'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nNow that I made the name Canibus a name you fear\nYou still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nThat's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\nSince I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear\nY'all niggas is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared\nAnd since I made the name Canibus a name you fear\nStay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared\nThat's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"\n\"Catch another sucker duck MC out there\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c13069157cf82b06434a58c5005ed904.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
