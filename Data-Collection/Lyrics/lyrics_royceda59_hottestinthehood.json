I'm digging it up and re-burying it\nI wish a fake would. Nigga, Nickel stay good\nThe nose on the shotgun wide like J. Hood's\nSpeaking of him, he's a bum\nHundred rounds, I hundred pound punks, get done\nRap nigga, rapping his way to his demise\nI ain't Ransom, chump; I don't shoot in the sky\nSpeaking of him, he a bum, too\nI treat war like it's a art like Sun Tzu\nI feel like I am the answer when the gun drew\nThe most rhetorical question is, \"What you gon' do?\"\nGang Starr pennacle as far as Preme goes\nThrough with the album. I'm in Bar Exam 3 mode\nY'all niggas fools; riding with niggas. I ride with pistols and gardening tools. That mean HOES!\nY'all motherfucker's crazy\nAnd I don't understand it like Ross dissing 50 Cent and Big and I'm Shady\nNo disrespect to Big Ross, I fuck with you, dog!\nY'all niggas tryna get rid of me: flush the toilet\nI'm the shit. The physical [?]. The fact that I got it is just why I'm down the Trick\nSpeaking of Trick, I'm down with Trick. What I spit is illegal it just sound LEGIT!\nAnd y'all so-so\nI'm in my own lane. Ain't nobody else in it like I'm in the car solo\nThe flow trip a nigga naked and then leave pasties on his nipples. I let the bars go-GO!\nYoung Vishis with me. He the next\nFit Slaughterhouse member. Let el Nino Bless\nWe like Woo, he the inspector; he on deck\nWe like the tribe, either the \"Booyah!\" or call quest\nI'm (bar bell brolic)\nMy niggas' killer bees. Y'all nigga smelling like bee pollen\nHoney. Don't do it to yourself, dunny\nGuess it's my nigga Crooked cause we can hit niggas on Ryker's Island\nYou can either die or dodge a bullet\nNobody riding but the shotty and me and my hooded. What else is you good at?\nYour rhymes is dying\nI'm flawless. Call me VVS diamond Ryan\nIt's how we got the lames\nKnock a nigga teeth out of his mouth, have him feeling that Tallahassee pain\nFuck the motherfucking bucket; he can kick the bucket\nBooyaka! Booyaka! Finger touching. End of discussion\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Vishis]\nSick rap, verbal AR\nPain kickback at the end of every bar\nHow are you a star when local is all you are\nYou a starving artist that can't walk through the mall\nCook crack, I don't even cook food\nI have my bitch do that, I'm that dude\nThe '09 ravishing Rick Rude\nLet you marry her so I can take her on a honeymoon\nAnd you two goon blog boss\nGet you all off, no cost, your loss. We want war\nJ Hood, you lunch, boy\n[?]\nHa! Laugh at you. Ain't got the heart to pull the piece and blast, you smaller than my niece\nSlaughterhouse affiliate, I'm a beast\nI don't write raps, I drop turds on beats\nAny random nigga better than Ransom\nBlog is bad for your health, you indoubted yourself\nYou a killer? Nigga, kill. Pussy be a pussy, smells fishy. Make them take the bait\nFor heaven's sake\nI rhyme like i can write rhymes for Weezy like Drake\nFor the cake I'll battle a savage\nFuck the cops. Show me the green, I'll bring malice\nHe trying to drop Hip-Hop, I'm trying to grab it\nFrom your ringtone rappers, fake Gs and faggots\nI know I ain't the baddest, true. My brother Smack Man'll have you bagged in the trash\nTrying to burn me and get your ass whooped\nFast as DJ VLAD calling Ross a turn piece\nCall the ambulance, he couldn't stand a chance\n357 in hand doing a hammer dance\nTake a nigga back like the Hammer pants, watch ya life get took from you like Hammmer's mansion\nRip up Bum C fright\nCold enough to swallow the sun and bring night\nSneeze light, fight through the cypher just to steal your pen, pad and your mic\nNot a killer but bullets change ya life like Erykah Badu, pussy\n\n[Hook:]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/892233b049a8da052593a9b4030be708.988x988x1.png"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
