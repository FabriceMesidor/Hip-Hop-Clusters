I'm blessed\n\n[Hook]\nMe, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir\nBut nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning\nMe, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by\nBut bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning\n\n[Verse 1]\nI make so many mistakes, so many corrections\nI'm so far from perfect, so many imperfections\nBut I'm a go getta, I get up and go get it\nSo if you're preaching prosperity, I wanna hear it\nI make the hood look good, turn the base into base line\nPunch lines to white lines, run from the one time\nMy verse is like a graphic scene, close your eyes\nNow you seen the dope fiend lean\nAnd you seen the pimp pimp hoes\nThe 4-4 blow and niggas puff dro\nLike there's no tomorrow\nHit that pass that, that's the motto\nYou know jail's like vacation for my friends\nThey go away, come home and do the same shit again\nYou think I'm bad, man they don't give a fuck\nThey trying do what they gotta do to get a buck\n\n[Hook]\nMe, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir\nBut nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning\nMe, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by\nBut bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning\n\n[Verse 2]\nI take the line out the good book an eye for an eye\nShoot me I shoot you back, I don't care if you die\nFirst the sun comes down, then the sun goes up\nAnd the coke price too when the D's make a bust\nIt's freeze nigga, get the fuck on the wall and\nEverything you worked for, they come to take it all\nMan it's like they don't know what they taking\nHit you with the tazer, I'll have you sizzling like bacon\nWhen you pray say a prayer for me, a nigga could use it\nThrough my pain there's a piece of me in all of my music\nGo head you can judge me, I'm hoping you love me\nI see I got it mastered, muh muh muh magic\nHocus pocus keep the bitches focused\nBefore we pop up on that ass with toasters\nLord forgive me I'm regressing again\nForgive me for that line and the rest of my sins\n\n[Hook]\nMe, I ain't got to send a usher around with baskets or talk to a choir\nBut nigga I'm cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on sunday morning\nMe, I run the streets all week, hustle hard, I do work to get by\nBut bet I be the cleanest motherfucking in the service on sunday morning", "image": "https://images.genius.com/166313582f6eb0df62feae151d4896fb.400x400x1.png"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
