My technique is Taye Diggs\nYour attitude is right that's why I made you my Wiz\nThe only girl that can make my shit jump, with the slightest touch\nYou at the stove while I'm grabbin my stuff\nGod forbid somethin happen to us\nLet's remain and friends and discuss our troubles and might try again\nWord to my Iron pen, it's not good to hold the cryin in\nI feel the same way your heart's trapped in the lion's den\nIron Man, I am him\nIt's the beauty in our souls through Allah where the love lies within\n\n[Ruff Endz: repeat 2X]\nCan't believe you found love in me, through everything\nHeld me down like my boys in the streets, here's the ring\nWhatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ruff Endz]\nEvery part of me, every thing I've done\nIs still there, still there, still care, ohhh\nAlways been there baby\nI don't wanna, and I don't wanna cry no more baby\nAnd I love, and I love and I love you girl\n\n[Hook] (+ ad libs)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
