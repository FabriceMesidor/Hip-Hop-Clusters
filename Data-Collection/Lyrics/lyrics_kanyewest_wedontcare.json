Kids, sing!)\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past 25\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle\n'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55\nAnd everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's\nAnd bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up\nWe put shit on layaway, then come back\nWe claim other people kids on our income tax\nWe take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid\nAnd we don't care what people say\nMomma say she wanna move South\nScratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house\n'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house\nCouldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work\nHe figured he'd take work\nThe drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight\nA nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight\nBut we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake\nAnd \"we don't care what people say\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDrug dealin' just to get by\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\n(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past 25\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou know the kids' gon' act a fool\nWhen you stop the programs for after school\nAnd they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic\nThey favorite 50 Cent song \"12 Questions\"\nWe scream: \"rocks, blow, weed, park\", see, now we smart\nWe ain't retards, the way teachers thought\nHold up, hold fast, we make more cash\nNow tell my momma I belong in that slow class\nSad enough we on welfare, they tryna put me on the school bus\nWith the space for the wheelchair\nI'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here\nThey tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here\nLook what was handed us, fathers abandoned us\nWhen we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance\nSometimes I feel no one in this world understands us\nBut \"we don't care what people say,\" my niggas\n\n[Chorus]\nDrug dealin' just to get by\nStack your money 'til it get sky high\n(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)\nWe wasn't supposed to make it past 25\nJoke's on you, we still alive\nThrow your hands up in the sky and say\n\"We don't care what people say\"\n\n[Produced by Kanye West]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
