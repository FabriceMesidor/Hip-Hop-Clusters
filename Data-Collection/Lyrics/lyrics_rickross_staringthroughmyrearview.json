myself, you know am saying?\n\n[Verse 1]\nPity you pussy niggas flying on my down for\nNever satisfying until them things going off\nG-Q's best dress niggas of di year\nNeed to yell out the state, how they volunteer\nCaught in traffic, but they never caught me slipping in it\nYou bitch, your nother mistress nigga, but don't get offended\nThe beef dead, now am moving on to bigger business\nBullet holes in your bust, but who benefit'n\nThe first song I wrote I did it whipping in the kitchen\nSoon as you get the pretty cars, then you come in killing\nTake your soul, then they sell it on the black market\nLost walking silk road, just another talking\nAward, tours, but the tribe still on a  quest\nPut out your cigarettes nigga when we be on the set\nHeart of a soldier so, go tell your management\nI have us bowing heads niggas with the candles lit\nCall\ufeff Adele a couples times, I got the voice mail\nBut you being on a line, I get a boy chills\nSitting in a corner by myself I hear the voice clip\nCross the Queens bridge, nigga bout a fourth gear\nBox on my ankle,  every night I plug it up\nAsking my lawyer, possibly could they be bugging us\nNever envy an artist as they reach their pinnacle\nMotivation came from everything we do\nWalk away from a scholarship and I bought a brick\nEverybody bet against me cause they thought I'd miss\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\nBet they right back on my dick, I say December 5th\n(Maybach Music) It\u2019s the boss Young Renzel\nR.I.P 2Pac, my nigga west coast\nMuch love, huh\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a hundred mill to pill through\nYou ain't fucking with devil, I can\u2019t feel you\nAt the top looking down, that\u2019s the crib view\nRiding in the wave, niggas staring at the rear view\nI got a hundred mill to pill through\nYou ain't fucking with devil, I can\u2019t feel you\nCorrect\n\n[Verse 2]\nMoney, women and drugs, that\u2019s all these niggas talk\nAin\u2019t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought\nBut in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot\nClangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off\nMoney, women and drugs, that\u2019s all these niggas talk\nAin\u2019t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought\nBut in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot\nClangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off\nMoney, women and drugs, that\u2019s all these niggas talk\nAin\u2019t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought\nBut in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot\nClangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off\nHomes of fatherless sons tryna fill that void\nThey screaming for help but the trap always kill that noise\nThey whipping and na-na, they whipping together yeh yeah\nThey think over the stove is how you whip up a pay day\nSo they talk\nMoney, women and drugs, that\u2019s all these niggas talk\nAin\u2019t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought\nBut in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot\nClangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off\nMoney, women and drugs,

off\nHomes of fatherless sons tryna fill that void\nThey screaming for help but the trap always kill that noise\nThey whipping and na-na, they whipping together yeh yeah\nThey think over the stove is how you whip up a pay day\nSo they talk and they rats like this shit is for pay plan\nNo niggas do a numbers, and a fans for fist scale\nYou niggas don't even know the numbers on when the breaks out\nNo bells for my partners but these cops walking\nAnd all you niggas wanna rap about is how you block popping\nBumping, am gonna war righteous with the stock option\nAm over timing these streets, Ain't no clock stopping\nMari-tones to this peace\ufeff among my comrades\nScreaming out free my nigga, being still he come back\nJustice for Tamer and posted up like a thunb tac\nOn my waist, I got one gat\nI show you the real purpose of a firearm\nA cop kill another innocent black, and we fire on him\nWriting on him, rear view to that bullshit you inspire doing\nMinds are ruin, we black hold in that capsule\nPill poppers became the new leaders, that's sad Joe\nLittle preacher from Stalli, maybe ain't that bad though\nPeace power the pot, or P Malcolm\nAm down for the revolution no matter the outcome\nNo matter the outcome\n\n[Outro]\nDecember 4th, December 4th, December 4th\nBlack market,black market, black market\nRicky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know Stalley)\nRicky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know Stalley)\nRicky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know Stalley)\n(You already know Stalley), (you already know Stalley)\nI got a hundred mill to pill through\nYou ain't fucking with devil, I can\u2019t feel you\nLet me hold that Ferarri my nigga\nAt the top looking down, that\u2019s the crib view\nRiding in the wave, niggas staring at the rear view\nI got a hundred mill to pill through\nYou ain't fucking with devil, I can\u2019t feel you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/26f2cdfc9fdcb22135f837c8ea35c566.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
