I feel like I\u2019ve been doing it for ten billion years\nBut every time someone says something like that to me\nI remember to just thank God for getting me this far\n'Cause sometimes you don\u2019t realize how far you\u2019ve gotten\nUntil you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you\nAnd I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know?\nIt's not going to be about connections\nIt\u2019s not gonna be about my looks\nIt's gonna be about who wants it the most\nAnd I want it the most", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d4b8299bec1aac14c1931423e8d3466c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
