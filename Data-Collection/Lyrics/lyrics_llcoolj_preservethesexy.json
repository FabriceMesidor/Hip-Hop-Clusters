Findel, Chanel, this is L\n(You doin a lot of frontin) But that ain't hard to tell\n(You tryin to flip me) Nah B (this I see)\nUh-huh, we'll see, spend a little time with me\nBy the time I make my move you be sayin finally\n(Ain't no moves to be made) Too many games get played\n(Too many chickens gettin laid and watch they reputations fade)\nWhere you from? (Detroit) What that mean? (I'm on point)\nRelax, we talkin, don't get your drawers out of joint\nI wanna see you smile, elevate your lifestyle\nCop a yacht, hit the South of France (not a chance)\nKeep your little advance, this one's on me\nAnd the chef's on board, you can eat for free\n\n[Teairra Mari]\nSlow down sweetie, my waist is 24\nI'm far from greedy (you're gonna love it, believe me)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL]\nCats sippin venom and spillin it on my linen\nMy baby smooth leather is softer than most women\nEverything is crisp from my cuff to my trimming\nWords can't describe all the garments that I been in\n\n[Teairra Mari]\nI been had Cartier, switch whips every play\nMy little Jack Rusell know how to hustle\nI stay with canaries on, platinum on every song\nHate it or love it, then respect how I does it\n\n[LL] + (Teairra Mari)\nUhh, well I'm not dem, that's how I got gems\nCost a quarter million dollars for them like shiny rims\nUnderstand me slim, this how the game begin\nIf he was me then he'd do the same to him\nBut L's the real deal, so tell me what you feel\nTell me one of your secrets, I'll keep my lips sealed\n(That's for me to know and you to find out)\nLong as we both know what we talkin 'bout, cool\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[LL] + (T.M.)\nWhat'chu wanna do?
