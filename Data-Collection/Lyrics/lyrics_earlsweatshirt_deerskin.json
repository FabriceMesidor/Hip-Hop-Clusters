The flexible bisexual, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 so\nWhat\u2019s perplexin\u2019, though, is that this adolescent's flow\nIs hotter than a motherfuckin\u2019 summer spent in Mexico\nCop me a mic, check and go, prepare for domination\nI got more flavors than a calm doctor has patients\nCut to the race, I\u2019ll come in first place\nRespect me or catch a Nike SB to the face\nNow, I whooped so many niggas that they callin\u2019 me racist\nI annihilate them, my flows amazing as grace is\nAsk them motherfuckers locked up in my basement\nI won\u2019t give a shit, fuck, once your face hit\u2019s the pavement\nA hater only flatters me\nWho's up to bat? We bastards, we savage, y'all handle more balls than Agassi\nNo body passes me, Fantastic 3 plus 1\nLeave catastrophes wherever we run, umm\nHun, pardon the casualties\nLyrically you can\u2019t pass me\nNigga tryina pass me got slapped like a black chicks ass cheek\nI\u2019m cold make the track sneeze, breakin\u2019 niggas like bad knees\nI got sweet steeze, so sweet I attract bees\nWith my, brainiac flows, the zaniest hoes know\nI hit niggas playin\u2019 me with low blows\nTo keep your eyes wide shut like a No-Doz\nI cop dough and stay afloat when I show boat, nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/26aab12b83ba9717e49e2205dd583b44.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
