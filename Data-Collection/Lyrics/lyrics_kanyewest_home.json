When I was back home\nIn the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud\nShoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds\nJump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around\nIf you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town\n\n[Hook: John Legend]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9368e74d31ea216d410c02def5b8ec60.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
