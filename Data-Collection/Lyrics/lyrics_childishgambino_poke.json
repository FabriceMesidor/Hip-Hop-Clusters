Lover III]\nOkay, Royalty is red hot\nShots from a redbone\nTalking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones\nBaby I'm just living right, and you can say I'm dead wrong\nBut can you disagree with that, Versace on me\nGot gold on the V-neck I'm passing every G  check\nDidn't fuck her for a month and never had a regret\nIt was just nice to have you chilling up in Key West\nAnd we was just chill, I didn't really need sex\nBut really is we fucking yo\nNever serious so I make everything a fucking joke\nShe be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke\nThen we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke\nSee she just graduated got a new job\nTook that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new Saab\nGot that boyfriend that she living with and she don't smoke no more\nBut, yo, it's cool, I liked her when I knew her back before like\n\n[Hook: Childish Gambino]\nIt's those summer days\nNever fade away\nIt just stays the same\nIn my mind, no no\nIt's those summer days\nNever fade away\nNever, never change\nIn my mind, no no", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77a2349de407b4d4690746b19b39f6dc.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
