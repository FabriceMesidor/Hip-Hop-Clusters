No complaint, sober a year\nHoldin it steady, livin trippin in over the fair\nOver the top, underneath and over the stairs\nIt\u2019s a step, taking another step closer to where?\n\n[Hook x2]\nMy brother was about to come\nI\u2019m over living trouble son\nI\u2019m over with the other ones\nWhere everyone is number one\nWhere everyone is number one\nWhere everyone is number one\nWhere everyone is number one\nWhere everyone is number one", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f623a35f878a736a8f0b28c4325a2245.500x496x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kurupt"}
