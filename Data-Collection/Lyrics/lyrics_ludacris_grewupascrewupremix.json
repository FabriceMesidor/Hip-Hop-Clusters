Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment\nWhether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY\nWe gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!\nYeah! Grew up a screw up baby\nGot introduced to the game, I ain't took a breath yet\nLet's go!\n\n[Ludacris]\nEver since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out\nSomething in my brain said, \"Wake up and kick out!\"\nRoberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out\nCause when I came I was draped up and dripped out\nSnip the umbilical, spit the government chip out\nPeace up, A-Town down and then I dipped out\nAnd oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out\nI slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out\nSomebody get him, the little nigga's out of control\nPut a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold\nGold gold, to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent\nThe essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen\nFreshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping\nI was the best in my section with flows hard than erections\nStill the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan\nAnd I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Jeezy over the Hook]\nLuda! What up homie? CTE nigga!\n8732, What it do?\nJay double! Let\u2019s get it!\n\n[Young Jeezy]\nI grew up right here, round the corner from mailman\nAnd when the first came we was waitin' on the mailman\nWhat you mean it ain't right? You better go get the scale man\nI don't trust them anyway, You know them niggas'll tell man\nFirst they run up in your place, now your ass got a case\nCrooked ass judge send your ass out of space\n8 by 6, now your ass out of place\nYour girl ran through your change, Now your ass out of pockets\nSpeakin' of pockets, mines gots the mumps\nA quarter mil' for breakfast, now what's for lunch\nI got a bag full of green shit, now where's the blunts\nSnuck in through the back nigga, now where's the front?\nDropped out in the eighth grade, Got money eight ways\nYo moms, fuck it I got shit to do\nListen, all you hatin' ass niggas that thought that I wouldn't last\nThe Inspiration on the way, ya'll can kiss my ass man\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI'mma be all the way real with this, look\nWhen I came into the game they ain't do nothing but doubt me\nNow the whole game's changed and it ain't nothing without me\nPicking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown\nOnly reason you on that song is cause I turned that down\nI went from Hot Wheels to big wheels, Hyundais to Bentleys\nAnd five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's\nFrom alright to handsome, from one room to mansions\nFrom hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons\nFrom, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a\nPlane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA\nFrom dice on the curb to stacking up chips, but harder\nFrom birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK! Guard your\nWomen dawg I went from ashy to classy\nWent from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty\nReach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars\nIt's not the hand that you're dealt but how you're playing your cards\nBoy!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d211edacb8de02968540124c6801063d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
