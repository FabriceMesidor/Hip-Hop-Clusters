I took ya family in\nI put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again\nAnd now you let the fear put your ass in a place\nComplicated to escape, it's a fool's fate\nWithout your word, you're a shell of a man\nI lost respect for you, nigga, we can never be friends\nI know I'm runnin' through your head now\nWhat could you do? If it was up to you, I'd be dead now\nI let the world know, nigga, you a coward\nYou could never be live until you die\nSee the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye\nType of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me\nWhen ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & Nancy Fletcher]\nGotta be ready, can\u2019t let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\nSo I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nCurious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious\nI'm addicted to currency, nigga, that's why we doin' this\nI got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up\nAnd then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up\nNo hesitation, this information got you contemplatin'\nHeartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation\nBreak him and let him see the face of a mental patient\nIt's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation\nI want members across the fifty states\nWe keep the nation anticipatin' until we break\nWill I be great, is it my fate to live the life of luxury?\nSome niggas bought my tapes, so much jealousy it scares me\nSo be prepared, 'cause only the strong survive, life isn't fair (fair)\nProbably never knew the way it feels to die\nSo you see, come fuck with me, I give that ass a try\nNigga, holla at me\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & Nancy Fletcher]\nGotta be careful, can\u2019t let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\nAnd now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nI should've saw the signs, I was blinded\nCriminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time\nSo many brothas framed in this dirty game\nIt's a shame, so much pressure on my brain\nWhy she blame me?\nSecrets in the dark, only her and I know\nNow I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow\nGuess she made a bad decision that got me livin'\nJust like an animal, I'm caged up in state prison\nMy niggas dissin' 'cause hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\nA cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'\nPicture my prophecy, I got some attacking me, on top of me\nI'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me\n'Cause I'm a soldier, hell, ever since I was a little nigga\nHavin' fantasies of one day getting older\nNiggas is paranoid, trust; a no-no\nLove is a mystery, fuck the po-po\nHolla at me\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & Nancy Fletcher]\nSo when you see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\nGotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\nA nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\n\n[Refrain: Nanci Fletcher]\nNiggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row\nThey try to playa hate, but they can't fade us tho'\nWe be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah\nWith that funky sound (so funky)\nWe be throwin' down\n\n[Chorus: 2Pac & Nancy Fletcher]\nGotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay\nGotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me\nSo when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me\nYou better beware where you lay\nWe better not find where you stay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0e663efef180da9b5d259005a1919e3.589x589x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
