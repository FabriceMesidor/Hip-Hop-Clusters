Young Future living lavish\n\n[Hook]\nSmoke kush, fuck bitches, That's the way it go\nDrink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go\nWalk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go\nThat's the way it go, that's the way it go\nBuy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go\nHit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go\nVIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go\nThat's the way it go, that's the way it go\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nI rock red diamonds like a maxi pad\nAnd yellow diamonds like a taxi cab\nMy closet look like a smash and grab\nMy driveway look like a launching pad\nMy English broke, so I'm slurring words\nImma zoo keeper, I'm holdin' birds\nMy swag absurd, can't be put in words\nYou old rappers, kicked to the curb\nNow the way it go, about 3 or 4\nI'mma probably leave wit bout 3 or 4\nAnd they followin and they swallowin\nI gotta house so big can't find em in\nOr I could get a room and just pile em in\nGucci Mane switchin' up the style again\nGotta hunned mill on my mind again\nI'm icey bitch, go blind again\n\n[Hook]\nSmoke kush, fuck bitches. That's the way it go\nDrink lean, sell dope, That's the way it go\nWalk in Fifths and buy the store, That's the way it go\nThat's the way it go, that's the way it go\nBuy some ice and ride foreign, That's the way it go\nHit the club and buy the bar, That's the way it go\nVIP, we usually stars, That's the way it go\nThat's the way it go, that's the way it go\n\n[Verse 3: Future]\nHit it wit the fork, Hit it, hit wit the fork\nIon drink unless it's dirty, and I'm higher than a hawk\nWhite and red tiger stripes, I'm in the Aston Martin\nI put the roof inside the trunk, the kush be stinkin' like a skunk\nI'm the clouds, just what I want. Today I smoked a hundred blunts\nI took this bad bitch to lunch, she been hittin' me for a month\nHad to make some time for her, I been busy all this money\nIf I ain't outta town doing shows, you know what I be on\nFrom Benihana to the Intercontinental draped in stones\nWit a pretty yellowbone, and she hold a nice tone\nGot a call and a text, hope it's money on my phone\nMy bitch flying in from Cali, say her flight 3 hours long", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7317e7abac3ca19d05f474a34f3a8dce.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
