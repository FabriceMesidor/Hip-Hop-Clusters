I don't think we wanna win\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan you help me? A nigga need a job\nI'm desperate, for some corn on the cob\nI'm helpless, will I have to steal and rob?\nNo black business so I got to ask Bob\nBob got a job but it's done by a robot\nNo lunch break so it can do a whole lot\nMo' than a human being, and it's European\nRan by a Korean-American\nSo there I am, surrounded by aluminum\nIt's nowhere you can run\nIt's nowhere you can be\nIt's just you and me, versus modern day machinery\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nIt's man vs. machine, baby\nMy head's in the guillotine, baby\nIt might take it off clean, baby\nAutomated dreams equals man vs. machine, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a fly caught in a web\nA fish stuck in the Internet\nDon't they know I'm a deadly catch?\nEat this meat, every bite so full of stress\nSo what can I say to you?\nI'm highly relatable and bio-degradable\nI thought we was unfadeable\nSlaves to machinery, is that the way to go?\nI don't need you to fuck\n24-7, I gets that computer love\nI don't need you to love\nHuman contact, ain't what it used to was\n\n[Hook]\nIt's man vs. machine, baby\nMy head's in the guillotine, baby\nAnd it took it off clean, baby\nAutomated dreams equals man vs. machine, baby\n\n[Outro: Repeat 2X]\nThe whole world is automated\nIt need to be investigated\nWhen people are eliminated\nWhat we 'posed to do when it's time to feed all the babies?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1c6e4522c58b032c43433a2345b1bb1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
