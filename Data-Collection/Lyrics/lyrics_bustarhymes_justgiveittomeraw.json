Thought the chicken head was a little rude\nThe wrong move making me whip it out like live dude\nFuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack\nToo many times, gotta put my foot in her ass crack\nJune for all of my niggas you know shit is all real\nA chicken head to fuck your mans and cut him a side deal\nOf all your prized possessions if you let her get yours\nBitch we keep it raunchy, everything will remain raw\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo\nI come to give you a little of what you asking for\nOh what you asking for\nOh yes\nI come to give you a little of what you asking for\nOh what you asking for\nSo what you asking for\nJust give it to me raw\nSo what you asking for\nJust give it to me raw\nSo what you asking for\nJust give it to me raw\nSo what you asking for\nJust give it to me raw\nOkay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/74d986e571f31c27df8d6f3000e2079f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
