She\u2019s not here, but I gotta give a peace out to her. Because I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for my mother.\n\nI looked on the front of this thing, and it said, \u201cStart from within to rebuild our original greatness,\u201d right? OK, well, that\u2019s what my mother did, know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. And I\u2019m listening about freedom fighters and strugglers, and you gotta understand that  when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn\u2019t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries. We didn\u2019t see none of that knowledge. If it was not for my mother, who stayed home and didn\u2019t go out and do all that, then I wouldn\u2019t have had shit--excuse my language. But I wouldn\u2019t have been nowhere.\n\nSo, what I want to do, hopefully, is, I want to be--I am--Tupac Shakur. I have to be a reminder that it ain\u2019t time to cool out, banquets and all that--it\u2019s still on. It\u2019s on just like it was when you were young. And you want to say \u201cfuck that\u201d just like you said \u201cfuck that\u201d back then. So how come now that I\u2019m 20 years old, ready to start some shit up, everybody\u2019s telling me to calm down. You know, don\u2019t curse, go to school, go to college...well, fuck that. We\u2019ve had colleges for a while now, now i'm saying, and there\u2019re still Brenda\u2019s out there, and nigga\u2019s is still trapped. And it gets me irked [laughs] because I understand that it\u2019s not gonna stop. It\u2019s not gonna stop until we stop it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just white men that\u2019s doing this to Brenda, and it\u2019s not just white men that\u2019s keeping us trapped. It\u2019s black, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? We have to find the new African in everybody, in all of us. Because if we keep running around looking for black and who got the most colors on and who got the baddest dashiki on, we still gonna get--and excuse my language--fucked.\n\nIt irks me right now that my mother is going through, you know, she has to get clean.  This is somebody I watched travel the whole country, during the time when women were scared to speak up for the Black Panthers. She spoke at Harvard, Yale, everywhere, and now I see my mother as what\u2019s really going on, and I don\u2019t see no big parades around my mother now. And she done got dozens of fucking awards. And I don\u2019t see nobody there. You understand what I\u2019m saying? So about all this, I take that lightly. I take all this lightly.\n\nWhat I want you to take seriously is what we have to do for the youth, because we coming up in a totally different world. This is not the same world that you had. This is not the 60s, this is not that. You grew up B.C.--before crack. That should say it all. We did not grow up with our parents. You had parents, that told you this and that and this is what went on back in the day. Now do you don\u2019t have that. You have young kids, fourteen, coming home and their mama\u2019s smoking out, or doing it to their best friend to get the product. You understand what I\u2019m saying?\n\nSo that means, it\u2019s not just about you taking care of your child; it\u2019s about you taking care of these children. It hurts that--no, it bothers me, not hurts--that I have to sidestep my youth to stand up and do some shit that somebody else supposed to be doing. It\u2019s too many men out here for me to be doing this. It ain\u2019t my turn yet. I\u2019m supposed to be following behind him, getting the knowledge. I don\u2019t even have a chance to get the fucking knowledge. I can\u2019t go to college; it\u2019s too much problems out here. I don\u2019t got the money, nobody do.\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not as easy as we mapping it out to be, and we gotta stay real. We gotta stay real. Before we can be new Africans, we gotta be black first. We gotta get our brothers from the street like Harriet Tubman did. Why can\u2019t we look at that and see exactly what she was doing. Like Malcolm did, the real Malcolm, before the Nation of Islam. You gotta remember: this was a pimp, a pusher and all that. We forgot about all that. In our striving to be enlightened, we forgot about all our brothers in the street, about all our dope dealers, our pushers and our pimps, and that\u2019s who\u2019s teaching the next generation. Because y\u2019all not doing it! I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s the pimps and the pushers who\u2019s teaching us. So if you\u2019ve got a problem with how we was raised, it\u2019s because they was the only ones who could do it. They the only ones who did it. While everybody else just wanted to go to college, and, you know, \u201ceverything has changed,\u201d they were the ones telling you, \u201cThe white man ain\u2019t shit. Here you go, check this out, young blood: You take this product, you switch it, you make money, and that\u2019s how you beat the white man. You get money, and you get the hell up outta here.\u201d Nobody else did that. So I don\u2019t want to hear shit about nobody telling me who I can\u2019t love and respect until you start doing what they did.\n\nTo me, this is Mecca. This is the black family--I see it here. But what makes it that much sadder, what makes me wanna cry is that, soon as I leave here, so does Mecca. We going back to the real deal. Right out there, you gonna see them same sisters in Brenda, they right out there. And y\u2019all gonna get in y\u2019all\u2019s cars and drive the fuck home. I apologize. I apologize, but check this out: you can\u2019t be no more offended by my cursing than what\u2019s really going on. That\u2019s real. That\u2019s real, y\u2019all. Because we letting the media--and the white man--turn us off. You letting them say that the rappers ain\u2019t real, and either gotta be the \u2018intelligent person\u2019 or you a \u2018gutter person.\u2019 We all the same. We all feel it like y\u2019all feel it.  I just can\u2019t hold a straight face when I see it.\n\nThis is proof that we can be together. The young black male is the future of us. And the young black sister is the future of us. It\u2019s gonna be what you put into it. So if you don\u2019t put shit into it, don\u2019t get mad when we blow up.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
