I don\u2019t really know\nCause I see you\u2019re pissed off when I go to shows\nI never really had a girl like this\nBut I ain\u2019t never had a girl who could keep interest\nThe things that I do, the things that I wanna be\nI know I\u2019m hardheaded, can\u2019t see things in front of me\nI\u2019m gonna be the best, you can believe that\nSo try an understand when I have to leave that\nWhen I\u2019m done, I\u2019ma give you the call\nDon\u2019t ya know sugar, you my sugar babydoll\n\n[Hook 2x]\n\nI love you both, can\u2019t you tell?\nI love her lights, I love the smell\nBut I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side\nShe pay for my house and she pay for my ride\nShe give me nice things and she make me feel good\nShe give me a little cash and I spend on you\nShe my sugar mama only with her for the money\nBut you know it\u2019s untrue cause I talk about her funny\nSaturday night\u2019s, I\u2019m supposed to be with you\nBut instead I\u2019m in bed with the stage and the crew\nShe laughs at my jokes, she tells me I\u2019m cute\nShe tells me if we together we make a little loot\nBut I know I couldn\u2019t have her if I didn\u2019t have you\nAnd I know sometimes I don\u2019t make curfew\nYa know I\u2019d never, ever, ever try to hurt you\nI\u2019m a just try to do what I gotta do\n\n[Hook 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/daedd4b19ad5d056f5ec69aae4af7839.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
