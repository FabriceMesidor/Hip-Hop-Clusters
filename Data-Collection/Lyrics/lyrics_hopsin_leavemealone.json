Ooooh...\nI been blocking my feelings but now I can't hide em\nBeen looking for God how come I can't find him\nNothing in my fucking world seems to go right\nEven though I hate suicide I need to go try\nI live my life the way I wanna, I ain't pleasing you\nGot a problem I'll fuck you up I got a reason to\nY'all tried to gain my trust saying we believe in you\nThen you walking on me after all that we been through\nThat ain't even cool, now death is what I hope you get\nAnd just remember that I told you this...\nWe ain't cool, I don't owe you shit\nLook what you made of me, now I'm... pshhh...\nMatter fact just stay away from me\n\n[Hook]\nNow, everybody who knows me understands I'm a humble guy\nThose who thinking they owe me\nJust do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nJust leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, I regret meeting all of you\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat if I left this world today in this crucial pain that I'm In?\nWould you be there at my funeral saying \"oh I loved him\"\nOr maybe, just maybe, you'll be that one nigga that never showed up\nI'm about to lose my mind, why must I have it so rough?\nListen closely as I'm rapping this\nI used to think money bought people happiness\nIt does but we never think about what happens after it\nSince I got it, I started to learn hate, everybody turns fake\nWanting shit like it's their fucking birthday\nAnd that just adds on the stress I'm already dealing with\nWhat am I supposed to let it build and sit?\nHell no, since then my fucking balls grew\nI said it once and I'll say it again fuck all you\n\n[Hook]\nNow, everybody who knows me understands I'm a humble guy\nThose who thinking they owe me\nJust do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nJust leave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, leave me the fuck alone\nLeave me the fuck alone, I regret meeting all of you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/44b49d0de2559bbc3b7d62a3cabcc0da.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
