Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac \u2013 rather Makaveli \u2013 was not available for comment but released this statement:\n\n[Spoken: 2Pac]\nIt's not about East or West\nIt's about niggas and bitches\nPower and money, ridaz and punks\nWhich side are you on?\n*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*\n*Encroaching footsteps*\nThese niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?\nYou niggas still breathin'?
