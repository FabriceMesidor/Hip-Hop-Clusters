Yeah, bitch, you so big\nYou walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig\n(Well, I have never)\nShe picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig\nPut me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig\n(Wait, wait, wait, wait)\nI felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)\nIt began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'\nGrabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)\nAnd took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down\nSorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop\nWhile I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop\n\n[Chorus]\n('Cause I don't know) As the world turns\n(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives\n('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through\n(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe drive around in million-dollar sports cars\nWhile little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards\nOutsidaz, and we suin' the courts\n'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)\nHypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat\nWhere all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at\nDressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage\nIt's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch\nI met a slut and said, \"What up? It's nice to meet ya\" (Hi)\n\"I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza\nBut I'm broke as fuck\nAnd I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)\nBut if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt\nBut I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers\nPlus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist\nSo give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny\n'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me\"\nI went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)\nWith an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)\nI fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene\nSlid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine\nJumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack\nAll day, and doped up on coke and smack\nAll I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse\nNow I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first\nRan through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut\nSaw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up\nKicked the door down to murder this divorced slut\nLooked around the room\nThat's when I seen her bedroom door shut\n\"I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked\nYou might as well come out now\"\nShe said, \"Come in, it's unlocked\"\nI walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne\nAnd seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn\nShe said, \"Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted\"\nI turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it\nShe came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her\nI shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her\nI started to beg, \"No, please let go\"\nBut she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll\nWith one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled\nI grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple\nJust tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick\nDuh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick\nWhipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it\nIt hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage\nI shouted, \"Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best\"\nStuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death\nOw, ow (Come here, bitch)\nOw, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)\n\n[Chorus]\n('Cause I don't know) And as we go along\n(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives\n('Round and 'round)\n(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)\nWe all face small obstacles\n(I don't know) And challenges everyday\n(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through\n('Round and 'round) These are the things\nThat surround us through our atmosphere\n(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)\n(I don't know) Every day\n(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning\n('Round and 'round) Keeps turning\n(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning\n(I don't know why this world keeps turning)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18fd7ff1ba2db7ae16a26498fc58bb64.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
