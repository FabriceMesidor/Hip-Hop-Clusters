Baby let me know\nWe go together perfectly, the Cancer and the Leo, yeah!\nI ride for you like a soldier\nBaby all you gotta do is give me your love, yeah\nThe world can get to know us, show love\nIf you'll be my valentine\n\n[Outro]\nHappy Valentine's day Alyce. I hope you like this. Sorry I can't be there, I'm on my tour but, just letting you know that I'm thinking about you, and I want the world to know as well.
