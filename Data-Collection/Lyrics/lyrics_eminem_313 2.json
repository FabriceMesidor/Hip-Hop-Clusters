No, we won't have that\nYou want your shit to blow up?\nWell, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack\nAnd blast that shit to kingdom come\nThen bring them some of this real hip-hop\nI drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run\nAnd you all knew from Meeko\nThat you couldn't hold your own\nWith the strength of Lou Ferrigno\nSo, stop that bullshit flow, yo\nYou need to come with the real skills and act like you know\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Eye-Kyu]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nSo what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?\nYou don't know shit, so when you see one, flee\nYou can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC\nI stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T\nI'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot\nI'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott\nYour ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me\nI'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory\nIt's either them or me, man, kill or be killed\nYour will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed\nMy facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity\nI'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty\nIf he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner\nThan Jeru jackin' off when he showers\nYou flowers got no clout with a thing\nYou could date a stick of dynamite\nAnd wouldn't go out with a bang\nI shout with a slang, simple as ABCs\nSkip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease\nDethrone MCs, and I'ma max alone\nRelax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone\nSo facts are known, biters get treated with shots\nI rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks\nI'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers\nYou couldn't make the fans throw up their hands\nIf they swallowed their fingers\nBut you can bring yours, let's see what you got\nBut don't front, and never try to be what you're not\n'Cause you can be quick\nJump the candlestick, burn your back\nAnd fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack\n\n[Hook: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\nMan, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a4f759aba2e16ec0dc9f29d1577cfede.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
