(I need a hundred...)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI seen a hundred niggas die\nI put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn't tell a lie\nUnless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night\nKillers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?\nI broke off the chains only the realest remain\nI see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?\nSeen a brother get slain for a jar full of change\nYet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Cane\nIs you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house\nA lotta scars on my back, get tattoes all around\nHundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins\nMoney on his head, bitch, I'm trying to make a fortune\n\n[Chorus]\nI need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men\nA hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in\nI need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell\nFrom a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell\nI need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)\nI need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)\nBlack coffins! (I need a hundred...)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI seen a hundred women burn\nAs they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ\nWhat did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm\nPigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm\nAny questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Dj-Django\nGot me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal\nAll I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!)\nOn the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer\nOur revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming\nGonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!)\nHundred dead bitches, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)\n12 gauge, shotgun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom)\n\n[Chorus]\nI need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men\nA hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in\nI need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell\nFrom a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell\nI need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)\nI need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)\nBlack coffins!
