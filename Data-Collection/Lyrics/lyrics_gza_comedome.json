She said, \"It's Yolanda\"\nShe said she knew me from back in the days\nAnd that I had her running on a wild sex craze\nI said now you're kinda big and well-developed\nAnd parts of your body just made my head swell up\nShe said her feelings were so deep for me\nTo the point where she wanted to sleep with me\nI said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin'\nShe said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin'\nI said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots\nAnd she said \"I hear ya troop\"\nAnd just from that little bit of conversation\nIt put my hormones into activation\nThe whole thing just went to my head\nAs I held her hands and said\nBaby, come do me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey good looking how many times may I say\nThat your gorgeous smile takes my breath away\nYour soft warm little voice is very pleasing\nAnd your tight mini-skirt is kind teasing\nMe, it makes me wanna do the nasty\nAnd you got the look of being very classy\nSo go ahead and whip it on me\nAs Latifah said, \"gimme that body\"\nSo you see right there I desire you\nI'm not a pimp and I don't want to hire you\nCause that's not what The Genius is about\nLet my love slide in and never slip out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
