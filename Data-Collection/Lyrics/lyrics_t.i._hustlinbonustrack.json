Geter, remember when you put up yo' last?\nThis for my niggas tryin to flip yo' cash\n'fore the Feds can get a chance to clip yo' ass\nGet a lot of powder in a Ziplock bag\nWrist full of rubber bands, 40-cal's in the dash\n\n[Hook]\n\n[T.I.]\nYo ay, ay, let me holla at 'em Gov'..\nI know some people love me to death and there's some that can't stand me\nCause I got a big-ass crib in Miami (what else?)\nAnother out in Cali, backyard so sandy (okay)\nAnd most broads find it hard to understand me\nBut the same attitude that make crews goddamn me\nIs the same ones that got me lookin cool at the Grammy's\nHaters wanna damage me but King you'll never be\nShawty holla at me when you get your first felony\nThen holla at me when you've been on Dave Letterman\nSay they never seen a real nigga so elegant\nLames wanna hear that real shit and I'm tellin it\nTrained the game to be sold and I'm sellin it\nChasin a Honda mil', that bullshit is irrelevant\nWe can race if you wanna, I bet on me and you'll never win\nSimply cause a loser's somethin I've never been\nIf you doubt now holla back at 2007 then\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Governor]\nHustlin... out here...\nHustlin... out here... {*echoes*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2f70d0ed3d87a3cc476cfb530ff86686.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
