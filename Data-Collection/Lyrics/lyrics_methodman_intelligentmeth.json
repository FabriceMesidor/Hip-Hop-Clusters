Problem needs solving\nYou see that big 357 thing revolving\u2026revolving\n\n[Verse 4: Streetlife]\nYeah, you niggas ain\u2019t street, my money talks word of mouth\nI figured you out the life I live, you\u2019re not about\nPrice on your head, I\u2019m taking cash advances\nI\u2019ll take my chances, then deal with the circumstances\nLivin\u2019 off the land like a land shark\nI\u2019m on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce\nIdle times a devil playground, make moves\nWatch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove\nHands high, say hello to my little friend\nPoint the finger at the bad guy, it\u2019s me again\nWho are they to criticize me? I do it like a G\nI\u2019m a nigga from the motherfucking streets\nThrow me in the fire, watch me bubble\nI was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle\n\n[Hook: Method Man]\nLook how we did it to ya\nY\u2019all just don\u2019t get it do you?\nSpecial deliver to ya\nThis is how we give it to you\nI'mma get it to ya (x4)\nWhat rapper spit it truer?\nBut they don\u2019t live it, do ya?\nMy shooter cock the Ruger\nThis is how we get it to you\nI'mma get it to ya (RAW)\nI'mma get it to ya (RAW)\nI'mma get it to ya (RAW)\nI'mma get it to ya (RAW)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fafd5b6184e352f00d35852ac8b31946.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
