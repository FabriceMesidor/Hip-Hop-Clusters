I can match it, that second-hand action\nWe exhale you inhale and asthma attack\nTeeing off, niggas nauseous as fuck\nFuck you thought? Bitch, it's GOLF\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nBrand new whip got no keys\nTailor my clothes, no starch, please\nSoon as I nut, you can gon' leave\nGot M's in the bank, like: \"Yes, indeed\"\n\n[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]\nThis shit going crazy, I swear I go crazy\nI never met him but man shout out Lil Baby\nWe running the thing *gibberish* I just ran out of words", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3183fe2788e384a639328cad7dc70be1.999x999x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
