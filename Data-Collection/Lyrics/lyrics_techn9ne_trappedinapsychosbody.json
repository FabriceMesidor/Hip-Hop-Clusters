I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nWhen I was younger I used to faint at the sight of blood\nNow that I'm older I notice that it ain't at the sight of blood\nNow the sight of blood equals the very first sign of love\nMenstrual cycles, feelin' like you right at your height of drugs\nBleed for me, baby, made your heart, rage\nFuckin' you makes me feel a murderous sensation, blood mixed with ejaculation\nCum bustin', bump heads 'til concussions, after we done fuckin'\nIf I can't get the spirit I've won nothin'\nI got children, and a wife\nHe's thinkin' of leapin' off a buildin', takin' flight\nBy now somebody should have killed him, end his life\nToo many motherfuckers feel him, in his mic\nSomebody stop him, 'cause he's fuckin' up my livelihood\nWith me trapped inside this psycho how can I be good\nTo my wifey, if it's remotely close to a punani\nHe's in it, a monster runnin' me back and forth\nTo the free clinic\nIf you a friend, time to say toodaloo\n'Cause ain't no possible way he can ever be true to you\nCancel your appointment to do the due\nIf he wants to kill himself, what the fuck you think he wanna do to you?\n\n[Hook: Laticia Naylor]\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nI am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'\nBrain deteriorating 'cause I'm X pill poppin'\nI got, more troubles whatever you got it doubles and triples\nAnd quadruples, havin' fantasies of eatin' nipples and noodles\nDrugs; take the pain away, used to have a lotta love\nBut now I fade away\u2014 The fact\nThat women love the music and they open they legs\nFor a psychopathic nigga that's so fucked up in the head, is beautiful\n(Told my parents this isn't suitable)\nDevil bitches'll learn (no!), gotta recruit a few\n(This nigga's gonna do me harm, I'm drugged up and I'm torn)\n(Look at this motherfucker he colored my hair orange)\nYou can't touch me, everybody loves me\nListening to my music, children are gettin' ugly\nIf I told you everything I was thinkin' it wouldn't be G\nTellin' you how many crossed my path, just wouldn't be me\nBut they know, 'cause they way low\nHow 'bout some X n fry n yayo, and fuck a halo\nA lot of Jim Beam, to have grim dreams would be healthy\n(Hey yo, I'm trapped, in psycho's body, can you help me?)\n\n[Hook: Laticia Naylor]\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh... It's about to drive me crazy\nOooooh... I'm a psycho baby\nOooooh...
