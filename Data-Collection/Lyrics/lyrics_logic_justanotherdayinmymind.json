I don't know\nFrom the bottom of my heart I swear to God I gotta blow\nThis for every time the world told me no\nIf I don't make it in this game I ain't got nowhere else to go\nFrom the drama to the hoes, from the records to the shows\nI gotta make it, and if they don't give me what I deserve\nThen I'ma take it, I've been underrated, underestimated and hated\nBut I can't wait to look back and say that I made it\n'Cause nowadays everyone's a rapper and I hate it\n\n[Chorus 1: Logic]\nY'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh\nSaid y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh\n\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nI had to face my demons and embrace all of my fears\nWhile you was out partying, chilling and sipping on some beers\nI was sacrificing adolescent years\nBlood, sweat, and tears to find out what music really is\nAnd now I'm feeling, I'm feeling like the moment has arrived\nWhere Bobby is no longer living and Logic has revived\nFrom his ashes, music, money, liquor, I'm fucking passed this\nLyricism that's driven from a master, you bastards\n\n[Chorus 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeeling good today (I feel good, yeah)\nFeeling lovely (I feel lovely)\n\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nAll I ever wanted was some financial security\nAnd now I fuck with bitches just to mask my insecurities\n'Cause pussy ain't nuttin', but my heart is sure full of something\nNow I'm, colder than ever, pushing through any weather\nHigh score flow, ain't none of y'all close to my level\nMental state of a winner in the shoes of a beginner\nVisualizing my horizon through the eyes of a sinner\nNoticing how the line between me and fame is getting thinner\n\n[Chorus 1: Logic]\nY'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh\nSaid y'all don't kno-oh-oh-oh-kno-oh-oh-oh\n\n[Chorus 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeeling good today (I feel good, yeah)\nFeeling lovely (I feel lovely)\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeeling good today (I feel good, yeah)\nFeeling lovely (I feel lovely)\n\n[Verse 4: Logic]\nYou know my steelo, busting shots like free throws\nThe young bandido, cutting records like they was kilos, ha\nIs it a blessing that I'm messing with girls\nThat wanna undress in the back of my car, or is it just 'cause I'm a star?\nOr is it just 'cause I'm a star?\nFive-foot-seven, look like she fell from heaven\nWith an ass hotter than the devil, please call a reverend\nShe was black and asian, part Hispanic and part amazing\nWomen they feen' us, merely because we are the keenest\nMy heart only has one love like Serena and Venus\nYou know I am the meanest genius with the biggest (hey!)\nSee, baby girl, I know you got some problems\nJust know I'm here to solve 'em, revolve 'em, cock 'em back and dissolve 'em\nI swear I take care of all em' but you gotta trust it\nLove it, open your heart before you lust it, now bust it, what\n\n[Chorus 2: Queen Latifah (Logic)]\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust a\u2014Just another\u2014Just another\u2014Just another day\nLovely (I feel lovely) Sunny Norway\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeeling good today (I feel good, yeah)\nFeeling lovely (I feel lovely)\nJust another day living in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeeling good today (I feel good, yeah)\nFeeling lovely (I feel lovely)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6118bfdbbde22320e3c6bc130e1772d3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
