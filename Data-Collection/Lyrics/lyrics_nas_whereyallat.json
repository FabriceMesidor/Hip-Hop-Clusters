(yeah)\nWhere them dimes at?\n(Fuck them other niggas)\n\nWhere them dimes at?\nWhere them dimes at?\n(Word to mother, niggas)\nWhere where them dimes at?\nWhere where them dimes at?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI slow dance with the Devil\nSnow setting in the bezzle\nMo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville\nPolo black scented, eyes squinted\nAir Force One's, with my own pattern in it\nFresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy\nPagan holidays, are way far from my reality\nFart through Evisu jeans, lethal green\nOliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens\nWith no AKs, I'm the ambassador\nRobin Hood in the Aston Mart\nLot of blood gon' splash in war\nTask force homicide, federalies gon' harass\nBut y'all ain't never seen nothing\nNot a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench\nThat went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate\nIsland Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent\nTo get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit\nYa bitch been wanna polish the dick\nThe big Benz, I'ma model ya chick\nWith Zac Posen, cash froze her\nCats stroke her, once I smash it's over\nCold like ice, more chains than slaves\nDangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel\nRoll the dice, I bring change when I gamble\nI could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere them gangsters at?\nWhere them dimes at?\nWhere where them gangsters at?\nWhere them dimes at?\n(Just ride with it)\n\nWhere them gangsters at?\nWhere them dimes at?\nWhere where them gangsters at?\nWhere them dimes at?\n(All my niggas gon' ride with it)\n\nWhere them gangsters at?\nWhere them dimes at?\nWhere where them gangsters at?
