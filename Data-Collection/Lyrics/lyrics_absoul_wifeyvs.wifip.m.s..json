I: Wifey vs. WiFi\n\n[Intro: Ab-Soul]\nMan, I hate quotin' Jay Z, but cuz just too tight\nIs he a Blood? Is he Crip? Is he that? Is he this?\nWill he do it? You know, it!\nNow every time I say \"it\" it's in reference to my dick\nYou can suck it if you want to\nEvery time I say \"it\" it's in reference to my dick\nAnd you can suck it, motherfuckin' bitch!\n\n[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]\nListen, bitch!\nWhen it's in you the sentiment is incredible\nWinter fresh even, I even undress your winter clothes\nWhen it's out, instead of worryin' about where it's at\nYou'd rather rack your cap\nAbout where it's goin' or where it's been\nWhere are we goin'? I'm beginning to see an end\nDon't bring Larry King in this\nSniff the evidence on my clothes and go through my cell phone\nAnd now I'm in jail for leavin' out a few details, oh well\n\n[Chorus: Ab-Soul]\nIt's wifey or WiFi (Ayy!)\nWifey or WiFi (Ayy!) wifey or WiFi\nGot some niggas in the pen that really gotta face time\nShe just bitching \u2018cause I missed her FaceTime\nIt's wifey or WiFi (Ayy!)\nWifey or WiFi (Ayy!) wifey or WiFi\nGot some niggas really havin' issues in the cell\nShe just bitching \u2018cause them other bitches in my cell\n\n[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul]\nOh well, oh well\nI guess she wanna go to war then\nI guess we should warn the warden\nOh well, oh well\n\n[Bridge: Ab-Soul]\nAlright, I want you to tweet me right now\nIf you're using your third iPhone\nIt's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi\nWifey or WiFi, hey, hey\nIt's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi\nWifey or WiFi, oh well, oh well\nOh well, oh well\nOh, I hit you with the hash back\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nAyy, my nigga lil' Riley got into it with his mommy\nThey be fightin' all the time, so I ain't pay it no mind\nHe said: \"God, she could really be the Devil,\" I said \"Chill!\"\nHe smacked his teeth\nAnd shook his head and said \"No, for real!\nYou know I love her, but she could really be a pain in the ass\nMatter fact, fuck that! Pull out your jack real fast!\nReal shit, my nigga, now glance at the keypad\nThis that mind-bogglin' shit you like to throw in your raps\nAnd this might be your best yet; notice how every number\nRepresents three letters of the alphabet\nLike, 2 is A-B-C, 3 is D-E-F\n4 is G-H-I,\" I said: \"I get it, alright!\"\nHe said: \"Now trip off this, listen to me, Soul\nI know you off the shits, but I'ma need you to get a grip.\"\nI said: \"Be serious,\" he said \"Dial M-O-M.\"\nWhat a hella coincidence! It was 6-6-\n\nPt. II:  P.M.S\n\n[Chorus: BR3]\nAll because of this penitentiary mind state, is it my fate?\nFor God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?\nI kept it real, and I ain't never been fake\nI'm feelin' like Biggie when he lost Faith\nSee, this penitentiary mind state, is it my fate?\nFor God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?\nI kept it real, and I ain't never been fake\nI'm feelin' like Biggie when he lost Faith\n\n[Verse 3: BR3]\nLook, there's sixty seconds left, I'ma have to get back later\nYour boy chasin' this penitentiary paper\nTell my momma stay on point\nYour phone hit her on three-way\nThen, fuck it, I'ma hit her on that other joint\nFirst term, nigga, but I did it like a vet\nHung up the phone, and when I asked: \"Who had next?\"\nIt was one of the lifers, all nest with no neck\nGotta stay with my striker, no nigga is no threat\nI swipe my knife on the under\nBut I can still hear it in my head\nWhen he said: \"That's right, youngster\nJust stay focused, sleep with your hands open\nBeat 'em with a long-handled spoon\nWhen you deal with smokers.\"\nI sag low when I walk the yard, hold my head high\nYaddada to them Bay niggas; me, I'm from the Westside\nLookin' for a gram to steal, \u2018cause I'm tryin' to get high\nThinkin' about my fake-ass bitch on the outside\nOut of sight, out of mind, shit, I don't mind\nLong as a nigga make the paper when he doin' time\nRight, look\u2026 fuck it, I'm lyin', I'm just really tryin' to hold out\nThought of some trick runnin' dick in my bitch mouth\n\n[Chorus: BR3]\nMy penitentiary mind state, is it my fate?\nFor God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?\nI kept it real, and I ain't never been fake\nI'm feelin' like Biggie when he lost Faith\nLook, look, hold up, hold up!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c2b989273a64cf1720624b72503a60bd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
