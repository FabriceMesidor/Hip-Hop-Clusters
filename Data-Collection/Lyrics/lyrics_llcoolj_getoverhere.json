knocking, the Bentley's rocking\nOverdose I'm suppose to roast 'em, with every bar I'm dropping\nEvery time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking\nYou a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping\nTalk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor\nLyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper\nWear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters\nIt's in my n-n-nature, never been a smoother operator\nSwitch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up\nYour girl from the back, like giddy up\nHow come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up\nInside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up\nThink about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that\nHop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback\nI'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that\nAsk Master P, I'm bout that\nEverybody know I'm holding, in the party, pocket swollen\nRock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon\n\n(Chorus)\n\n[Lyrikal]\nWhat up ya'll, ya'll know us\nKnow the party ain't ill til we show up\nOnce we hit the scene, the chicks go nuts\nSorry if I intervene, ma, but so what\nPour more cups of the drink, cups of the guz stop\nTil I'm all drunk in the place, burn the kush to the face\nMaking the dudes wanna hate, cuz we them new dudes in the state\n\n[Jiz]\nYeah, we in the club just chilling, B, yeah, baby feeling me\nFeel like a barbecue, shorty keep grilling me up\nIn the club doing stacks where a ceiling be\nDo it well, ask LL dog

from to the north to the side, I'm a young back, just shut\nYour mouth\nShut your mouth, turn it around, shake a little bit, drop down to the ground\nMost of the time, don't stop or pound, before we

this ain't no tease\nYou gonna be scarred, I'mma sweat that weave\nNow you can't drive, it's too much speed\nJust sit back and enjoy that breeze\nIn the whip today, but not tomorrow\nThat's the life of a superstar\nWanna be involved, better be aware\nTicky Diamondz got women everywhere\nDo it on the floor, stairs to the chair\nDo it on the beat, please, hands to stare\nGot you on the beach, you out somewhere\nGot your girl screaming that it ain't that fair\nBaby come true, got enough bread\nSwitch to the truck, nothing more said\nKid don't play, just do clean\nThat's what it is, when I come from Queens\nDo my lean, big black truck\nComing through like I'm moving that stuff\nI just get checks, just get neck\nGirls I'm afraid, running round butt nake\nGotta go, back to the grind\nBack to the tracks, back to the rhymes\nBurn a little haze, I let my rhyme ---\n\n(Chorus)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
