I'm here, but I can only help you\nIf you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nYou're alright with him\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nMy Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead\nTake what's in my heart and put it in my head\nSee, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you\nMy life is yours, my soul I gave you\nI don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)\nAnd we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)\nSometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)\nBut I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)\nYou keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song\nTalk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong\nThis is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it\nPraises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it\nI was that kid that, been there, did that\nBecame ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that\nUse me as an example\u2014if I can do it, then they can too\nWith the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do\n\n[Chorus: Regina Bell]\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him (The light with him)\nYou're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\nI know you've never seen him\nBut don't fight with him\nYou're gonna make it through the night\nTo the light with him\nUhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)\nI said you're alright with him\n\n[Outro: Regina Bell]\nHe's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause it'll be alright\nYeah, he's by your side\nRight by your side\nX, dry your eyes!\n'Cause, it's gonna be alright\nYeah yeah, yes it is!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57efb548310ed90e73d9200fd01a3e59.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
