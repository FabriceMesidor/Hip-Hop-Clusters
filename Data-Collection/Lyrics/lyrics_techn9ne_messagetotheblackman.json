say something like this\nIt takes a hella motherfucker to say it\nThis song is dedicated to all my people\nIts called Message To The Black Man\nCheck it out\n\n[Chorus]\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows\nWe've been all over the globe\nYa we makin' the dough\nBut y'all ain't spinnin' it\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records\nAnd peepin' my shows\nY'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt started on the slave ships (slave ships)\nAnd field niggas would eventually take the day shift\nWith house niggas inside loyalty may shift\nAnd it did divide us now we still need a race lift\nFuck a face lift\nI ain't changing my identity\nFor energy from any that's obscenity\nNow in 2007 we sick and ain't no remedy\nJealousy envy and murder it's like you ain't no kin to me\nGuess we ain't nigga we go hard in the paint nigga\nStill when you see me out you ain't the one who faint nigga\nIt's them other fans from them other lands\nThey listen to me more then my sister and brother man\nI could see if I was a wack motherfucker\nBitchin' about the way that my people act motherfucker\nBut I do spit my people don't be so fuckin' reclusive\nGet off of your lazy ass like you know something about music\n\n[Chorus]\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows\nWe've been all over the globe\nYa we makin' the dough\nBut y'all ain't spinnin' it\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records\nAnd peepin' my shows\nY'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou cry about the way I paint my face\nIt ain't y'all taste, little homie let my state my case\nI'm not a devil or damn jester rumors can fester\nNever uplift a demon with the image of my ancestors\nAfrican, act like you see me when you be traffickin'\nLaughter when you frown up at me your hatred is bafflin'\nYou watch American Idol my people my paint is tribal it\nSymbolizes not evil but the will still in survival\nYou niggas be so tough the moment we roll up\nYour upper lip rolled up you hatin' it so what\nEveryone knows us my city is sold up\nMy shows crush but y'all don't show up\nThey say it's more than money bitches whores\nIt's funny this here's war my people at his door\nAnd I'm knocking, meanwhile we rocking\nGlobally and it's sad man\nLight black attendance got my people lookin' real bad man\n\n[Chorus]\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows\nWe've been all over the globe\nYa we makin' the dough\nBut y'all ain't spinnin' it\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records\nAnd peepin' my shows\nY'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wouldn't be bitchin' if I didn't want you around me\nThe way you write me up as a demon astounds me\nBrotha Lynch, 40 Water, Federation, DMX\nBusta Rhymes, Quincy, and X-Clan found me\nBrother J homie he with me til this day homie\nWho you know that's blacker then that?\nWith a staff and a 'Lac\nMy people lovin' that trash and they rap\nI'm immaculate maybe they grab it if I was blastin' a MAC\nAttackin' my people 'cause I'm black and I'm lethal\nWith this rap I don't trap, but I'm crack\nWhy you do be so close-minded when I'm rhymin'\nWishin' you can find it\nEverybody but you motherfuckers get behind it\nAnd I'm doper then a ki nigga\nMessage to wee niggas\nRocking sold out shows is where I'm gonna be nigga\nAnd that's all I sell out, something you should see nigga\nBetcha would come and see it if I told you it was free nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you at my shows\nWe've been all over the globe\nYa we makin' the dough\nBut y'all ain't spinnin' it\nMy people you 'posed to be\nMy people ain't ya\nBut my people ain't something that I see\n'Cause ain't enough of you up on my records\nAnd peepin' my shows\nY'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control\n\n[Outro]\nAct like you know I\u2019m your very own, motherfuckers\nHardcore shit, stop buying all that bootleg bullshit,

behind his motherfucking ass, you dig me?\nTech N9ne, nigga!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d568b86ce102e78c9c49f201c1a48234.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
