We, we are just two people\nWhat more can we do\nGive me one more day\nI\u2019mma spend it with you\nWith you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can\u2019t complain, that people know my name\nAnd when I come back home, not a damn thing change!\nI bet people can\u2019t believe\nSome after the money\nSome want a degree\nIf you\u2019re showing love, then you\u2019re cool with me\nI\u2019m the same old dude, before the jewelry\nAnd everything kinda new to me\nThings ain\u2019t nothing like they use to be!\nPeople thought I wouldn't\nSome people thought that I probably could\nSome people think that boy turned to Hollywood\nLiving up every day, worth while\nDude roll away when they see the girl smile\nI\u2019m glad I get to call her mine\nThis the type of thing so hard to find\nYou can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly\nShit's gonna happen, it's just all in time\n\n[Hook]\nHey! We are just two people\nWhat more can we do\nGive me one more day\nI\u2019mma spend it with you!\nWith you!\n\nI'm dealin' with somebody, and I don\u2019t know what to do\nThey may not understand you cause they see you on the move!\nGirl this dinner over, I'm tryin' to get you to my room\nCause I\u2019ve been going crazy, baby you don't got a clue\n\n[Hook]\nHey! We are just two people\nWhat more can we do\nGive me one more day\nI\u2019mma spend it with you!\nWith you!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/366878b883f76791456cd61fd70a9b6c.275x275x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
