(Vitamin C pills and orange juice)\nWhat are you drinking, gin? (Nah dude, it's the shroomz)\nThe shroomz? (What?)\nYeah, that's some other shit\nOne of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mothership\nHow high it make you get?\nFucked up?\nThrowing up guts?\nOr do it have you stuck with soft dick and can't fuck?\nHold up\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow chew 'em up and slam the orange juice\nVitamin C chase\nKill the taste\nYou can tell it's nasty by the look on my face\nDon't get it twisted like a nigga coked up\nAnd druggied down\nSee cannibus and mushrooms be coming from the ground\nAll natural\nPost it at the club\nLooking funny-style\nTight slack\nPimp feather hat\nWhere the bitches at?\nWe giving orders at the bar holding money\nWhen all of a sudden\nAll the people started looking funny\nAnd started lookin runny\nAnd liquify\nRight before my very eye\nThis a different kind of high\n(Ohh shit, you see this shit\nThese motherfuckers melting and shit...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNiggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize\nFeeling hypnotized\nPupils dialated, changing size\nThat's when I heard the battle cries from across the room\nSet these crooked niggas straight\nLikwit Crew, activate\nForm of, a bunch of wild niggas mashing you\nCame crashing through\nElbows and right hooks for you\nWe got thrown out by this time\nMy shit is blown out\nPull the phone out\nAccelleration and we bone out\nIn the zone out beyond\nCaptain Kurk and Klingon\nShit that I'm on\nBe high powered like a Yukon\nBack to my house, fucked up\nTrying to see straight\nHow much of that bullshit did I actually take?\n(2 grams dude)\nGod damn, no wonder why I feel like a underneath\nTold the white boy \"Faggot, we got beef.\"\nOver did it holmes\nNiggas playin' bones in the living room\nRestless, try to find anything to mess with\nWhere my keys at?\nPickin up clothes, trying to fold the shit\nSee my riot gage on the wall, better unload the shit\nFucked up niggas and firearms dont mix right\nCocked back the chamber, dumping shells 'til it felt light\nThought I dumped the all, Counted 7\nBut it was 8, straight gone\nPoint the barrel at the floor, let it go\n\n[Outro]\nFuck! Shit!...Wooow...Ay, ay, ay, It's cool, I just shot the floor man\nIt's all good, it's all good...Ay, ay, where everybody at?
