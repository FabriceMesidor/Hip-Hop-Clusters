What are you doing? That's so nasty!\"\nIt might seem ill\n\"Ew! Go wash your hands!\"\nKookies\n\n[Outro: Samples]\n\"DOOM is master of the world.\"\n\"I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug in my history book.\"\n\"You've disturbed me for the last time.\"\n(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't all bad\n(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?\n(Voice 1): Well I gotta admit that I've been having a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black\n(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack one more time and send you back then, Benjamin\n(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny\n(Voice 2): He must be mad\n(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can\n(Misc. Voice): Food, we need food", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f67af5eb94d7101171adfff4ca96a76c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
