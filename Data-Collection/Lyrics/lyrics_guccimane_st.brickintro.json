EA, GA\n1-0-1-7, Wop, six\n\n[Verse]\nMiddle of the winter I pull up in a vert\nIt's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt\nSanta Claus of the hood\nI pull up with the work\nThey call me East Atlanta Santa\nRun up on me get murked\nI'm just trappin' through the snow\nSellin' nine half a bricks in four ways\nOver the hills we go\nGot an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)\nI'm a neighborhood philanthropist\nI'm sellin' bales of cannabis\nPreachin' like an evangelist\nBut I don't fuck with amateurs\nI drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas\nMy diamonds are immaculate\nI'm not on no romantic shit\nBut I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit\nI'm so trill, your ho can't handle it\nBut damn, that bitch can suck a dick\nSkeeted on her face and lip\nGuwop can't fuck no basic bitch\nThe teacher teachin' arithmetic\nShow you how to whip a brick\nLearn you how you run your clique\nAnd told you how to kill a snitch\nMy young girl she a freaky chick\nBut damn she on that sneaky shit\nRan off with a half a zip\nAnd now I got to slap a trick\nAll these record labels broke as shit\nRicky Dinky record shit\nI sell more meth than a Mexican\nMy dog food yea its excellent\nI done started sellin' Christmas tree\nI'm tryna jingle bells ho\nIts Christmas time its Hollis, Queens\nI'm stompin' in my shell toes\nChristmas time in '96\nI asked Santa for twelve golds\nBut now Guwop got gifts to give\nBut I don't fuck with twelve though\n\n[Outro]\nSanta Claus in the city, bag full of goodies\nI wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live\nI'm tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil\nI'm the Bricksquad boss I'm like Santa Claus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e346585343669f785da446478e1db2aa.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
