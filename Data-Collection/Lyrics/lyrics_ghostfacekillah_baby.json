I'm alright\nJust that the baby's kicking, I want some Popeye chicken\nAnd my back kinda hurt from the way I was sitting\nHurry home so you can rub my big belly and kiss it\nAnd I need some, don't be fresh, girl\nYou know I can't help it, baby, it stay wet, girl\nYeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake\nLeave me weak in the knees where I can't even walk straight\nThat's the reason I got two court dates\nGrown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that\nI was raised in the Stat', that's my word\nI pluck something if you fuck with my bat\nAnd my name ring round the way, girl, she the sweetest thing\nI love you Starks, writing hearts in between our names\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Raheem DeVaughn]\nMr. Producer, drop the beat right here, now\nGhostface Killah, let me talk to them\nRadio Raheem\n\n[Bridge: Raheem DeVaughn]\nI will be the sweetest thing you've ever known\nLike a kiss on a, collarbone\nI wanna be ya, best friend, your homey and your king\nAnd bring to fruition, all of your dreams\nAnd so you're having my baby\nSo stay forever my lady, like Jodeci\nNow, push (push) harder (harder)\nI'd rather you be wifey, than to be a baby father\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea54fa933d61e534fbf14d9509cc7146.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
