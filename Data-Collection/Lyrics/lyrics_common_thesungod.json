Common...\n\n{Common}\nYeah, yeah\nHi-Tek\n\n{Verse One}\nFree the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss\nUnit in the stash the beats and never found the shit\nExperience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched\nCats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch\nIn my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it\nI'ma give it, as far as you can take it\nTried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny\nMany can find it but few can climb it\nI'm open-minded like a pothead\nDoin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed\nIn the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls\nWorn hoes, who been molested by they uncle\nI bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers\nThe world is bitter, like baby mothers\nLook how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us\nLeast God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God\n\n{Verse Two}\nEverywhere is broken glass\nNephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass\nTry not to say shoot around my daughter she already know to blast\nCatchin the future, don't know who threw the past\nIt's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon\nNiggas is fake like bitches braggin\nListen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion\nIn motion like cars\nI'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars\nThe world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours\nSome say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies\nChild of the sun, I allowed it to raise me\n(.. from a distance) niggas tried to appraise me\nI'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me\nMy days be spent, behind dream's tent\nThrough the sun the divine being is sent\nIt's the Sun God\n\n{Verse Three}\nLetters from prison sayin we need a better religion\nI'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position\nI can't crystalize the mission lies within\nBorn to die even in death we begin\nIt's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know\nAnd carry low swing on a chariot slow\nBrothers stick though remindin me of revolution\nIf the drama comes I'ma have to uhh pop his gun\nIt's the Sun God, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/334bd07941665eb5b381fb51bced319d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
