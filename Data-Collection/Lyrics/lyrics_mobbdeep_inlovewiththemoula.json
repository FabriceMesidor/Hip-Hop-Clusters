I'mma take good care of you, I'm gonna put you right there. I ain't letting you go this time, nah you gonna stay right here. I'mma call you money baby, money\n\n[Verse 1: Havoc]\nIt started bout 7 when I realized ya worth\nSold drugs just to get you all, along with it's perks\nTook a backseat, cause family came first\nHoles in my sneakers and shirt\nI turned 13, now lil' niggas selling coke\n50 for 11's, yeah, I copped 'em for them hoes\nBut you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson\nI had you but you showed me no affection\nGot withdrawals, took you to the malls\nThe more I got of you, the more I got spoiled\nNow my toes curl, lets have a baby boy or girl\nHad you in Switzerland, half across the world\nGrew up an investment and you can't be doubled\nCame back around when I bubbled\nNow I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn\nLet my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone\n\n[Interlude: Havoc]\nWhere you going, baby? Where you going?\nTalk about money this is money baby, where you going?\nI can hold you baby, I can hold you, let me hold you\n\n[Hook: Prodigy]\nThe thing about you is you make me smile\nYou build me up when I go down\nYou give me strength, you give me power\nMay no one come between this thing of ours\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nYou give me sex, you give me gifts\nYou give me head from every baddest bitch\nYou make me happy you make me sick\nCause baby you my drug and I need my fix\nIf I ain't have you how would I live\nTo get you I'd risk that time in prison\nTo get you I'd take risks that'd mean death\nI'mma love you until the end\nIts all about you my precious, I'd never ignore you\nFor a bitch again, I'd put that on my organs\nGot these other nigga jealous cause you all over me\nIn public, you be all inside my jeans\nTook me all over the planet, places like Europe\nTaught me new tricks at them banks out in Zurich\nThese niggas, back in the hood\nCould never have you like how I do\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Prodigy]\nI need you, I need you in my life. Stay right here with us. Ain't nothing over there for you. Stay right here with us you in good hands right here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/796af50ac59c2535e57e1fca6de975b5.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
