To the bumper hit the throttle while im tryna hit the pothose\nI'll freakin take Madonna to McDonalds\nAny ho in the porizontal getting fondeled\nI don't cuddle I don't caddal\nOnly models that I follows\nEverything I drive, whether it's a navo-ho or tatho\nIt's got a ho in it\nNah ho I don't got no freakin Bronco\nYou're looking for a buck? Get a horse ? tano\nI got a rusty Honda with some bonda and a box of condoms\nLittle blonde Bitch Fuck me? Fuck you too\nLike a Mcbanaro-boo-abano\nAnd I ain't from this planet so nano - nano nano\nI'm intolerable, too vilatle, screw it\nI don't gotta make the Honor roll to be On a roll\nI don't know much, But what I do know I do it pronto though\nSo knock it off all these knock-off me's\nThe last thing the world needs is another me\nBut if you think, this is part 2 to recovery\nOr Love the way you lie part 12\nOr something Heartfelt you're about to make a Discovery\nLike you failed Christopher Columbus's compass\nAint dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers so suck it\nI took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach that punctured a lung punk but I'm still functioning from it\nChump, this is nothing now watch, while i fuck one up it and toot my horn\nOnce i think of something to trumpet\nAnd i don't need a fucking In-strument to sound off like a trunk of a elephant the triumphent\nReturn of the ether spittin' retard, reborn, but chances of you having another rebirth, slim to none\nLike a skinny Mother Theresa, Give a fuck it's easter! So kiss my keester! Because that's the only thing i turn the other cheek for !", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
