No\nAlcatraz was purchased by a white man\nFor 5 grand, with intentions to expand\nMore prisons\nSo these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation\nThey for grossing a bigger business\nImagine\nWe're being used\nImagine\nThe truth shall be told\n\n[Chorus: Javonte]\nLife's about decisions man\nIt's in your hand and you got it\nJust take control if you can\nIt's in your hand and you got it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de49545ec6453e829bb3ff6d34d088db.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
