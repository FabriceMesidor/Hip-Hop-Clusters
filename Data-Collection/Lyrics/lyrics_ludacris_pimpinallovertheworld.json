Ain't no need of even askin' brah\nThe best women all reside in Africa, and that's real\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nSing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)\n\n[Outro: Katt Williams]\nPimpin' pimpin' pimpin'\nLadies and gentlemen as we ride out\nCould we have all the real pimps\nPlease put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?\nNow ladies look around with me\nLet's see if we can weed some of these niggas out\nCause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'\nNow if you happen to see a nigga\nWith two sweat patches up under his arms\nLook like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water\nPlease tell that nigga \"put your hands down\"\nIf you smell like you been at work all day and your car\nPlease \"put your hands down\"\nNow look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air\nIf you see him ashy around the knuckles\nLike the nigga wash half of his hands\nAnd lotion three quarters of his body\nPlease say \"put your hands down\"\nIf your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'\nIf you are dancin' on the dancefloor\nAnd you look to your left and your right\nAnd you do not see a woman in sight\nGuess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin\nIf your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood\nThat's because you didn't order Vodka buddy\nThat's why it's three dollars a glass\n\"Put your hands down\"\nNow look down, look down\nI need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time\nOkay, you see the nigga with the white socks\nNOT PIMPIN!\nSorry unless you part of the \"Beat It\" entorauge\nIf your shoes have a buckle on...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57e6650f3864beef0e227e02f76d83b0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
