{"songs": [{"title": "Bounce (Commentary Version)", "album": "Under Pressure (Commentary Version)", "year": null, "lyrics": "\"Bounce.\" Um, this one, man. This for me was just fun. I wanted- as soon as you heard the song come on, like just that sound, um, I wanted people to grow crazy in the crowd. Like, I created this song just to perform live, to have a great time. Um, however the entire album is extremely conceptual. You know, it's not like I-I-I left anything out, I wanted to make sure that even in the fun, kind of partier records like this, um, there was still substance there. For me, this is for the day one fans. This was like our celebration. Like, \"We been at it way before the fame.\" So before anybody knew who I really was, or, you know, the numbers came in, or the this or the that, this was just like, \"Man, we been at it way before it,\" and this is- this is for me and the people who know what hard work means. We're gonna just turn up and have a great, great time. Um, and yeah, it's really a simple song", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ba79e87d2e7e865cbf9187de5396056.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
