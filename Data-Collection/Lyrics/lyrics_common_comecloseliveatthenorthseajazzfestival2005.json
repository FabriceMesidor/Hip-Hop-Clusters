Blige]\nWhat I'm really tryin' to say is\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love come through\nPut your hands in the y'all, it's the basement party\nI know this world gets crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nAre we living in a dream world?\nAre your eyes still green, girl?\nI know you're sick and tired of arguing\nBut you can't keep it bottled in\nJealousy, we got to swallow it\nYour heart and mind, baby, follow it\nSmile, happiness, you could model it\nAnd when you feel opposite\nYo, I just want you to know\nYour whole, being is beautiful\nI'ma do the best I can do\nWhy, 'chelle, 'cause I'm my best when I'm with you\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Common)]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\n(Yo, let your love hold you)\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\nNothin', nothin'\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nYou've helped me to discover me\nI just want you to put trust in me\nI kind of laugh when you cuss at me\nThe aftermath is you touching me\nDestiny that we connected, girl\nYou and I, we can affect the world\nYo, I'm tired of the fast lane\nI want you to have my last name\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige + (Common)]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\n(Let your love hold you)\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n(Yo, sing it with us y'all, take 'em to the bridge)\n\n[Bridge: Mary J. Blige + (Common)]\nI know what you're thinking, you're on my mind\nYou're right, (Say what?) you're right, you're right (Yeah)\nYou're running so fast, you just might take flight\nHope you're not tired, (When y'all?) tonight, tonight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045767268a13a813bd7645f24fad7896.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
