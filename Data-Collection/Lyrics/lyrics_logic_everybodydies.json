been waitin' for, ain't it?\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\n(You are watching a master\u2013)\nThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\n\n[Verse 1]\nGrew up broke as fuck, rich folks was adjacent\nMaryland, starin' out the window for motivation\nI remember Lil Bobby, Lil B\nMan I wish that I could be a dog in a rich family\nOh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe\nNow my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P\nNow I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be\nMy life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me\nI am not top ten, more like top three\nI am not two 'cause nobody could top me\nGet the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me\nI can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary\nBut somethin's missin' from the game, when I'm gone, oh it's me\nI feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, woe is me\nI just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker\nI got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker\n'Cause I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums\nGreatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome\nI do it for the boom bap, the trap and the radio\nFuck a fake fan, steppin' to me, try to play me, ho\nI make music for every genre, every occasion\nMy shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane\nGoing crazy in the gym, goin' in gains\nHad a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane\nI was born in the darkness like Rick James, bitch\nSippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys\nSaid them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly wanna ban me\n'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me, uh\nLike these rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me\nI said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me\nThey hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me\nThey hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me\nThere's nothin' but legendary shit that be goin' on, the phenomenon\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are watching a master\u2013 at work\nThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\nThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got my rap and I got my gat\nYeah they got my back, but I won't bust back\nUnless I need, this world is greed, I lead by example with ample\nEducation, my lyricism is here to imprison your vision\nThe fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it\nEverybody di\u2013dies deep within this world we live in, and not everybody tries, but everybody lies\nYou can't take\u2013 money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery\nBut also don't blow it, you know it, don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic\nLive your li-life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it\nDon't murder others 'cause you disagree with they beliefs\nWe all the same underneath\nI had some shit I had to get off of my chest in that first verse\nBut this verse come first when it comes to importance of message\n(Do what you love, do what you love)\nDo what you love, do what you- do it, do it\n(Do what you love, do what you love)\nDon't do it, don't do it, that's society\n(Don't do it, don't do it, do it, do it, do it)\nBreak free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon\nRattPack be the platoon, so much more is comin' soon\nYeah I've been goin', I'm already knowin', know Bobby been flowin'\nMy shit get around like a woman that's hoin'\nMy body been growin', my mind been growin'\nI'm already knowin' that I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day\nGod already got the date set, so live your life, live yo' life\nYeah you live it, that's a bet, 'cause if you ain't fulfilled in the end\nYou gon' be filled with regret, bet\n\n[Chorus]\nThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?\nYou are watching a master at work\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\nThis what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?\nRap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment\nAll these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went\nTen years and runnin', we came up from the basement\n\n[Outro]\nYou are watching a ma\u2013 master at work\nLogic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ccbb977ba02fff0826405b701b7dd31.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
