It's the only word I use to begin and end each communication with my fellow man. \"Peace\"--it's the prevention of conflict. \"Peace\"--it establishes both parties on a ground of mutual respect no matter who they are. \"Peace\"--it's universal. If an alien jumps in front of your ass, comes at you like \"BLAAH!\"--you can still say \"Peace.\" He may even understand you.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peace. The whole energy of the word itself is good.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peace.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But as they say, come in peace, but prepare for war.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9416fec27305323c4a10672a8e3c4875.570x370x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
