my family\nAnd it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nAnd to my niggas on the block\nOn the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks\nYou hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nI'm hidin' out and smokin' herb\n'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves\nBut I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nSee rappin' is my only way\nMy mama told me just to save it for another day\nBut I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\n\n{Verse 1}\nMan, I can hear that wind blowin'\nYou say it don't get cold in CP\nWell niggas it's been snowin'\nEven though some might disagree\nWhen business is still slowin'\nEven if we subject to change\nCome up out them diamonds and rings\nEven all them dollars and change\nNigga we home-grown\nAnd to those that couldn't take the pressure\nNigga they long gone\nSkeet 25 lighters on dressers\nOr you'll get zoned on\nThey be puttin' them bodies in bags\nThey be cuttin' them bodies on slabs\nThen go to somebody and brag\nGot to keep a straight face\nBetter keep inside what you know\nGot to find a safe place\nBetter stay in silence or go\nOr end up a waste case\nPick figure it's more stuff to do\nPick nigga it's more folks than you\nPigs never come close to a clue\nI put my life on it\nWant to disrespect give me your neck\nAnd I'll put a knife on it\nSome say it's slippery when wet\nBut my Roll got ice on it\nIt's all about supply and demand\nIt's all about me buyin' some land\nYou folks just don't understand\nThat, uh\n\n{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}\nIt ain't no one to trust but me\nAnd I got to make sure that I take care of my family\nAnd it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nAnd to my niggas on the block\nOn the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks\nYou hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nI'm hidin' out and smokin' herb\n'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves\nBut I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nSee rappin' is my only way\nMy mama told me just to save it for another day\nBut I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\n\n{Verse 2}\nMan, I see the clouds comin'\nY'all see a man on the moon walkin'\nI see a crowd runnin'\nAnd the APD steadily talkin'\n'Cause we done found somethin'\nAnd it's not as good as it seems\nOh, I wish I could get some cream\nAnd get up out of the hood with some dreams\nI'm peepin' hard crimes\nSee the system's fucked up\nAnd they givin' out some hard times\nHeard one of these wannabes lucked up\nAnd one of my people snortin' hard lines\nLocked up and they didn't do a thang\nLocked up because of the pressure and pain\nLocked up because they wouldn't do the same\nAnd I see the case closed\nI can't ask no questions, and it's over\n'Cause they say so\nI ain't learned no lessons, but these snitches\nBetter lay low\nOr we gonna be choppin' some heads\nAnd we gonna be rockin' some beds\nAnd we gonna be droppin' some eggs\nWe walk a long road\nTryna find the essence of self\nBut I picked the wrong clothes\n'Do rag with a gat under my belt\n'Cause life's throwin' strong blows\nBut I keep a little hope and some dreams\nAnd I try to stay focused and clean\nBut I got a little dope and some green\n'Cause, uh\n\n{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}\nIt ain't no one to trust but me\nAnd I got to make sure that I take care of my family\nAnd it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nAnd to my niggas on the block\nOn the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks\nYou hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nI'm hidin' out and smokin' herb\n'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves\nBut I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nSee rappin' is my only way\nMy mama told me just to save it for another day\nBut I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\n\n{Verse 3}\nI can see them shamed faces\nMan, y'all look at me like y'all grew up\nIn the same places\nScams and dirty work came up on\nA day to day basis\nNow they got to re-up and re-bag\nAnd they got to re-up and re-slab\nThen they got to be up and be bad\nThis game'll never end\nExcuse my French, but God dammit\nI got some clever friends\nThey might get set back by some wench\nBut that bitch'll never win\nIt's all about the way of the world\nIt's all about the way of them girls\nIt's all about them diamonds and pearls\nWe waitin' too long\nBut the DEC and Southwest Atlanta\nIs too strong\nWe might bring that soap out and wash up\nAnd throw them suits on\nComin' in the court with some pride\n'Cause we ain't got nothin' to hide\nJust didn't know what laws to abide\nI play the cards dealt\nAnd I bought a full house and I watched\nThe woman's heart melt\nSee my mama's cooled out and she's cryin'\n'Cause it's heart-felt\nIt's all about supply and demand\nIt's all about me buyin' some land\nYou folks just don't understand\nThat, uh\n\n{Chorus: Ludacris, Chimere}\nIt ain't no one to trust but me\nAnd I got to make sure that I take care of my family\nAnd it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nAnd to my niggas on the block\nOn the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks\nYou hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nI'm hidin' out and smokin' herb\n'Cause my boss is gettin' on my motherfuckin' nerves\nBut I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)\nSee rappin' is my only way\nMy mama told me just to save it for another day\nBut I got to make it 'cause it's cold outside", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6be5b941352dc17a593995dffd367cec.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
