I think I wanna say it again, y'all\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\nCan't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nYo! Big Krizz Kaliko\nTell 'em, y'all can't fuck wit' us\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Verse 2: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nFuck niggas that got it in for me\nPretend the crowd's still got its energy, loud!\nRulers finna be crowned\nThrough foolin' around with ya's\nTwo hands and both thumbs down bitches\nFrom biancas and biatrices, the theatrics is miraculous\nYou don't want to go on after us (no!)\nThis is a snippet of ridiculous, can't-get-with-us flows\nActually a little bit of babblin' liftin' your soul up\nAnd we all grown up\nAnd when we blown up\nDon't get to frontin'\nI'll give you country boys nothin'\nYou can cut us to thirty we stay on for an hour\n'Cause them heads bobbin' in the crowd's ours (ABSOLUTE POWER!)\nMain thing's taking over this mainstream\nThe game seems like they been waiting for a new A-Team\nAsk Busta Rhymes, he said that nobody had the gift like him and Spliff\nBut me and Tech N9ne who y'all ain't fucking with\n\n[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\nCan't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us\n\n[Bridge 2: Tech N9ne]\nThis beat make me wanna say hallelujah (HAHAHA)\nYo, but instead I'm gonna say (what!?)\nY'all can't fuck with us\nY'all can't fuck with us\n\n[Verse 3: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nOkay this the benediction (now we got y'all listenin'!)\nWhoa, just a fraction of friction from an act you was missin'\nIf you would actually listen you'd see whose ass you'd be kissin' (MUAH)\nYou're dealin' with one hell of a relic, ya see\nI'm angelic but devils bring out the devil in me\nI might pull it, the bullets'll be several, you'll see\nA goody-goody get hoody, lesson from messin' with me\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nThis is my testament Tecca Nina's been pressed against walls\nSimply the best to get next to this so I represent all\nGrab your breasts to this, have mo' sex to this, pop your crystal\nCock ya legs a bit, rock ya bed to this, drop the big drawls\n'Tis to men to never wanna take a stand to\nYou chumps in trouble? We 'bout to bubble like shampoo\nYou might try but you can't do what Aaron and Sam do\nYou tryin' to ban who?\nNo can do!\n\n[Tech N9ne]\nIt's a celebration bitches, yo\nY'all can't fuck with us\n\n[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No! No can do\nY'all can't fuck wit' us\nNoo! No!
