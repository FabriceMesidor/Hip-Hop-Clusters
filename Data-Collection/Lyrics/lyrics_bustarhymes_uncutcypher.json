Wade\nRun up in the Gucci store and drop 3k\nYou bum, I could get your whole outfit out of BJ's\nLyrical scientist, leaving mics with psoriasis\nAll this work that I'm shitting is Michael Myer's psychiatrist\nPyrics suppliacist, who be lying stiff when the iron spits\nI come alone, just me and one 9 Johnny [Unitas]\nAnd let my bitch serenade through these slums\nAnd blow so much loud, I need a hearing aid\nFor my lungs\nAnd as far as metaphors, rate this\nI was a snail til haters threw salt on me and I dissolved into greatness\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nWhat goes around comes around like a hula hoop\nHair weave killa, I'll show up to your funeral\nAll this work, I need a cubicle\nClear coat cuticle, different color diamonds like a Rubix Cube\nIf this was New Edition, I'll be Bobby Brown\nPut the check over your head and call it Nike Town\nHow could I be down, Free Boosie, wipe me down\nMy credit card is black and proud\nI've been trapping since Rocsi had the ankles out\nI'm going to the money and I took the paper route\nUh Yeh, I'm hood approved and I'm street tested\nYou a nobody............ anorexic\nIf you stay next to me, you're close to a blessing\nSo, I'm guessin, I could get arrested -\nFor aggravated flexing, with all this ice on\nMy mic on, I apply pressure like a python\nAnd everybody know this that body flow, bench press, cardio\nThey try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse\nYeh, they plot on you, and they drop on you\nI put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma\nBow! From 30 nights of sipping dirty sprite\nI call this shit Bluetooth because I don't need a mic, 2 Chainz...\n\n[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]\nI said \"Please Stephen Hill, don't even put me in a cypher.'\nThere's only one outcome when I get a little hyper\nYou gonna start seeing niggas getting nervous with they shook ass\nYop!
