That's all patience and God's amazing\nSee what I came out of dawg? That should be motivation\nNow all I think about's broad chasing and car racing\nMoney so long, my arm shaking, the foreign banking\nI'm off the shore, flow so hot, I could spar with Satan\nI open doors with my voice so [?] my face is\nRollie mixed race, got a big face\nGotta get cake, brought a big plate\nPrada windbreak, thought I went late\nNow that Benz skate, down the interstate\nHow'd I get great? Not a mistake", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b15a7a3f6cd968108322d49a5fd4ba25.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
