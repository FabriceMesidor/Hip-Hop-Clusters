What the fuck is that?)\nGet a piece of paper, ball that mother fucker up\nPlay with it\n\nI got the alcoholic juice-ah to wake you up like a rooster\nBack when I was young, I used to be a booster\nStealin' candy from the store\nGo to school, I had the whole playground\nChewin on my gumma\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Playin' steel to the chest\nAnd I was the best playin' kickball at recess\nI used to play pop-gun, go the Bears and make fun of losers\nWe used to hop corners on the fresh beef cruisers\nPlayin' Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin' Reese's\nI had all the women cause my tough skin has creases\nAnd its been that way since day one\nGirls of the world ain't nothin' but fun\nI used to watch Dr. J, come through with a touch\nRemember New Zoo Review and Starsky and Hutch\nI remember lunch time we used to rhyme out loud\nPeace to the whop in the hip-hop crowd\nI remember\n\nI remember (I remember)\nOh, when we used to hang, on the porch\nDrinkin' brew and then the drive by (baby)\nI remember (I remember)\nWhen we used to play shoot 'em ups\nUp and down and the gang bang (baby)\n\nOh now, now now\nI know you do\nI remember yesterday (oh I remember when we play)\nI remember yesterday, ohhhh\nI remember how, when we used to play (I remember)\nI remember when we, I remember\n(used to play dominos, all night long, dominos, all night long.)\nI remember yesterday\nDo you remember yesterday?
