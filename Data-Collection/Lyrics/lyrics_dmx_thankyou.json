(Our father) I'm a talk this (Who art in heaven)\nStart walk this\n\n[Verse 1: DMX]\nIn the name of Jesus\nI can have everything good of the earth be given to me by him\nIn the name of Jesus\nThere would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win\nIn the name of Jesus\nI lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life\nIn the name of Jesus\nWhen I save a thousand two or save ten\nSo I thank the lord for my wife\nIn the name of Jesus\nI want to thank you what you showed me what you told me\nIn the name of Jesus\nI want to thank you for your love and watchin over me\nIn the name of Jesus\nI don't have to, go through what I went through anymore\nIn the name of Jesus\nI don't have to (What!) now that I got you in my life ever more (Come on!)\n\n[Hook: Patti LaBelle]\nI know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh\nWithout you\n\n[Verse 2: DMX]\nIn the name of Jesus\nYou gave me the book, so now I just look when I need the word\nIn the name of Jesus\nYou took, a crook, gave him a new look now he speaks the word\nIn the name of Jesus\nIt don't matter what we did tell it to the lord and he forgives\nWhatever it was right or wrong\nI'm a catch up with the herd then I'm comin home\nIn the name of Jesus\nI ran away for far too long starve too long\nIn the name of Jesus\nWhere people perish for lack of knowledge\nThey all too strong let's get it on\nIn the name of Jesus\nI realize I'm a sinner\nI repent my sins and right this moment am a beginner\nBaby in the spirit, let me go\nIn the name of Jesus please let me go!!!!
