(When is change gon\u2019 come?)\nSomebody tell me; somebody tell me\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd every day it\u2019s something different\nIt\u2019s either politics or one\u2019s religion (Yeah, yeah)\nWe need to keep our guns in my opinion\nIt\u2019s the people that you need to take control of\nYou have the right to bear your arms what they told us\nIt\u2019s tragic when an innocent is gunned down\nBut Congress wants to take away our guns? Wow!\nNow, what about off in Chicago?\nHuh? Them little children in Chicago\nParents heart-broke; I pray I never know that feeling\nAnd although the truth is so revealing\nWe push it to the side like we don\u2019t matter\nAnd that shit makes me madder\nThat\u2019s right, my government Brad Jordan\nNo different than a Trayvon Martin\nNo different than a shot down leader\nYour picture of a blue-eyed Jesus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a8834d350e698012cc58bd228f90719.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
