done said so much that I don't even got that much to say\nI done cried so much (so much)\nI done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away\nQuiet\n\n[Hook: Royce Da 5'9\" & Mr. Porter]\nThat\u2019s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)\nSilence be the same color my chain is (quiet)\nThat\u2019s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)\nSilence be the same color of my watch (quiet)\n\n[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nHold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut\nThem street sweepers will come through and clean your house up\nUs Detroit niggas call that yellow-taping the scene\nMy south niggas call it chalked up, you know\nWe put money on it when it's real, they call me Mr. Fifty a head\nI'm sending ten niggas to kill ya at ten until\nEvery man got an expiration date and a price\nAll my revolvers got the spinnin' wheel\nI make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White\nThem racketeering charges startin' to look like a tennis deal\nI caught it, garden in my backyard guarding the weed and lookin' like some spinnish spiel, but still I'm dealin' raw\nFrom selling to buying weed, actually I'm stealin' all\nI'm the last of a dying breed that I'm out here killing off\nFour of my closest friends don't know their papas so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin' off\nGet money\n\n[Pre-Hook: Mr. Porter]\nSee I done said so much (so much)\nI done said so much that I don't even got that much to say\nI done cried so much (so much)\nI done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away\nQuiet\n\n[Hook: Royce Da 5'9\" & Mr. Porter]\nThat\u2019s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)\nSilence be the same color my chain is (quiet)\nThat\u2019s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)\nSilence be the same color of my watch (quiet)\n\n[Verse 2: Tiara]\nShhh, I should have been born deaf mute\nTalkin' get you stripped naked\nShootin' at your feet, dancin', till Chippendales at your rescue\nIf there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you\nLook, time is money, I'm on EST\nKeep playin, light up your block like Christmas E-v-e\nI'm the new edition of poison: BBD\nFor that bread my niggas will stamp you: EBT\nI let a hot line sting 'em, you and the cops while I'm singin'\nEver since you left the city, now they hotline's blingin', hmm\nSeen a paddy wagon cruisin' and I'm deducin'\nThat they are only movin' cause all the rumors that you in\nIf I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losing is\nBecause of the illusion, you are not in collusion\nWith the boys that's wearin' blue and it's causing all this confusion\nAnd they wouldn't even know, but y'all tellin' what niggas doin'\n\n[Pre-Hook: Mr. Porter]\nSee I done said so much (so much)\nI done said so much that I don't even got that much to say\nI done cried so much (so much)\nI done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away\nQuiet\n\n[Hook: Royce Da 5'9\" & Mr. Porter]\nThat\u2019s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)\nSilence be the same color my chain is (quiet)\nThat\u2019s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)\nSilence be the same color of my watch (quiet)\n\n[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nI'm going on an AK-a-thon\nThrow a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon\nDouble parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine\nI ain't in the zone, I'm in the mother fuckin' lay-up line\nSpeaking of lay ups, we do homi's based on how we doin'\nLast lay up line I was in was a body viewin'\nI'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills, good 'erbals\nFirst meal was milk, I milk these niggas for my first meal\nFull circle, off of just talking I can tell types\nBut I still give that bitch my whip test\nIf she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe\nPlayin' that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ\nI'm standing over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness\nMan a cure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right\nOnly hand-me-down I had was inherited head lice\nBut nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice\nE'ery day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice\nRest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right\nAsk me to spell die, I'mma accidentally spell dice\nI can shelve a label with my shelf life\nI'm a rider, but still I steal bikes\nOut of the field, terrorizing reptiles and field mice\nI'm cut like I'm touched, a blind man with braille spikes\nI'm deep, I could break up a mother fuckin' whale fight\n\n[Pre-Hook: Mr. Porter]\nSee I done said so much (so much)\nI done said so much that I don't even got that much to say\nI done cried so much (so much)\nI done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away\nQuiet\n\n[Hook: Royce Da 5'9\" & Mr. Porter]\nThat\u2019s how it be when you come up around gangsters (Quiet)\nSilence be the same color my chain is (quiet)\nThat\u2019s how it be coming up on my block (quiet)\nSilence be the same color of my watch (quiet)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/533ac062d389201c4e7eb9a973709ea4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
