Yeah I'm still in like I never left\nThey know I had to go but then I brought it right back\n\n[Hook 2]\nLike woah\nDo it like woah\nDo it like woah\nGoing through it like woah\nYou already know\nYou already know\nGotta get it like woah\nIn this bitch like woah\nGet it like, like, like woah\nLet's go\u2014Uh, I'ma get it like woah\n\n[Bridge]\nI get so high they wonder why no I can't go away\nI gotta hold my own, know that's the only way\nI've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know\nI've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go\nFeeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute\nIf it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite\nI'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb\nLately I've been in my room\nLookin' and lookin' at records on the wall\nHold up\u2014\n\n[Outro]\nLike woah\n\n[Skit: Kevin Randolph (as Joseph Kai)]\nYeah I hope we make it to fuckin' paradise and not die on the way there, mothafucka...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cf4166acf4e70b35b9b74f921748fb85.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
