Can you smell that in the air\nWhen I'm smokin' up the building from everywhere\nShit I still get down so just sit down\nWhen my thought starts clownin'\nTime to skip town when\nYet I go wrong I got to hit my bong\nLater on then I'll be getting high all along\nI got a friend named Mary Jane\nAnd she makes me feel strange\nNow I've got to call out her name\n\n[Chorus: Cypress Hill & Sonic Youth]\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\n\n[Verse 2: Cypress Hill]\nCan I call mari-juana\nIf you wanna party\nWell, shit, I'm gonna as soon as she comes\nAround to my neighborhood\nDamn and she always smells good\nLet me make this understood\nAre you experienced\nHave you ever been experienced\nNot for the lightweight... make you delirious\nWhy is the room spinnin'?\nI can't stop!\nNow I must have been drinking\nCause this ain't pot\nThat's doing me like this\nI feel ill, now I'm calling out to Mary\nCause I just can't deal\n\n[Chorus: Cypress Hill & Sonic Youth]\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nI love you, Mary Jane\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high\nSugar come by and get me high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b27946683c7f72c17189cfbb235289dd.938x940x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
