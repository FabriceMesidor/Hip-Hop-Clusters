(Where?)\n\nRunnin' from the police (Yeah, I know what you mean)\nNo matter what I do, they got a nigga\nStill runnin' from the police\n(Put them motherfucking Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)\n\n[Verse 1: Dramacydal]\n\n[Young Hollywood]\nI ain't got nuttin' on my mind, but gettin' in some trouble\nLicking shots to they block, leavin' bloody blood puddles\nFor some ridah's delight, now we in a gunfight\nI can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight\nIt's on me, but if I die, bury me a motherfucking G\nA open casket on them bastards so they all remember me\nWith my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece\nThug Life motherfucker, got me runnin' from the police\n\n[K-Dogg]\nNigga, you know that's true\nCatch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin' with a crew\nEvery damn day parlay with my glass of Re\nThe O.J. and it's all okay\nTo that fuckin' fake cop, got to play the man\nRan me down the block with my glass in my hand\nDamn, I hope it don't spill\nNigga chill, shit is real, cock back my steel\n\n[Big Malcolm]\nStill runnin' from the police, I gets no sleep\nI got you peepin' in my window, while I'm smokin' indo\nBut I ain't no motherfucking track star, pigs got a jeep\nLike Big Malcolm, runnin' through motherfucker's backyards\nSo I grabs my piece before I flee\nAnd instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me\nLick shots, hit spots off on my piece\nCause a nigga like Big Malcolm is through runnin' from the police\n\n[Hook: Buju Banton]\nNow it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice\nThey try to cock me, but them can't gun store\nWhat about they come to hold up me north\nPulled up the park, I left school and let's buck\nLook around, look around, punk po-lice\nRun as fast as you can, but you can't catch me\nLook around, look around, punk police\nMe have to blast back, cause they blast at me\n\n[Verse 2]\n[Stretch]\nYo I was, schemin' and fiendin' for loots and took the crooked route to\nGhetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game\nThe insane brain, cold gettin' fly like a plane\nOn them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin' ruckus\n\n[The Notorious B.I.G.]\nCheck it, I grew up, a fuckin' screw-up\nGot introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up\nChoppin' rocks overnight\nThe nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White\n\n[Stretch]\nAnd we got the workers choppin' rock, fiends by the flock\nAnd we gettin' it, the dirty cop is jealous so they sweatin' it\nI'm lettin' off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke\nAnd provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide\nWe keepin' it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel\nLet's serve these motherfuckers, slugs as a fuckin' meal\n\n[The Notorious B.I.G.]\nWe had to grow dreads to change our description\nTwo cops is on the milk box missin'\nShow they toes you know they got stepped on\nA fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon\nRun from the police picture that, nigga, I'm too fat\nI fuck around and catch a asthma attack\nThat's why I bust back, it don't phase me\nWhen he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze\nCelebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight\nLaid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker\n\n[Hook: Buju Banton]\nNow it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice\nThey try to cock me, but them can't gun store\nWhat about they come to hold up me north\nPulled up the park, I left school and let's buck\nLook around, look around, punk po-lice\nRun as fast as you can, but you can't catch me\nLook around, look around, punk police\nMe have to blast back, cause they blast at me\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nThey got me runnin' from the five-o\nDuckin' and dodgin' and my survival\nDepends on when I let off with my nine, ho\nI'm movin' swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex\nCause in my mind all I wonder is who's next\nNigga, my homie slipped and now he pays the price\nHe did a drive-by, sixteen, now he's doin' triple life\nTell me is it me or my upbringin'\nI spit that thug shit\nNigga, motherfuck singin'\nI hope you got your Timberlands on tight\nCause I ain't givin' up\nI'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night\nI'm runnin' through the projects, biatch\nThey'll never catch me\nCause I'm loc'ed and trigger happy on the, sniatch\nDon't say you never heard of me, til they murder me\nI'm a legend\nDo thug niggas go to heaven?\nI'm rollin' with the Thoro Headz\nWe gettin' ghost on them hoes and yo\nI got no love for the five-o\nI'm runnin' from the police\n\n[Hook: Buju Banton]\nNow it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice\nThey try to cock me, but them can't gun store\nWhat about they come to hold up me north\nPulled up the park, I left school and let's buck\nLook around, look around, punk po-lice\nRun as fast as you can, but you can't catch me\nLook around, look around, punk police\nMe have to blast back, cause they blast at me", "image":
