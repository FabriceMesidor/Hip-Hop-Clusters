More like most racial\nThey hate for you disgraceful\nDon't let them take you off your base, let them motivate you\nDon't let it overtake you, so what another clause\nSurvive the storm but riding on the beach in the southern wild\n\nLord knows I had it hard today\nHad it hard today\nStill I gotta keep my head up high along the way\nCause it only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\nIt only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/talib-pic.png"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
