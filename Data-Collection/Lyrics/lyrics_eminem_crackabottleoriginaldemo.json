Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for\nIn this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes, 400\nAssaults, and 4 murders\nThe undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady!\n\n[Chorus]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model\nYou just hit the lotto\nUh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves\nNow where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Dr Dre\n\n[Verse One]\nThey see that low rider go by there, like \"Oh my!\"\nYou ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why\nI dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre\nI'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me\nBut hey, what else can I say? I love LA\nCuz over and above all, it's just another day\nAnd this one begins where the last one ends\nPick up where we left off and get smashed again\nI'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz\nDriving around with a smashed front end\nLet's cash that one in\nGrab another one from out the stable\nThe Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado\nThe hell if I know\nDo I want leather seats or vinyl\nDecisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision\nOr maico beats quake like Waco\nJust keep the bass low speakers away from your face though\n\n[Chorus]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model\nYou just hit the lotto\nUh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves\nNow where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\n[Verse Two]\nBack when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk\nPicture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust\nJust one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus\nKiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts\nThey disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks\nIt's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked\nBitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut\nMissed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut\nNow picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought\nCuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft\nIf I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time\nEvery verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes\nIt's elementary the elephants have entered the room\nI venture to say with the same repetition is true\nNot to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal\nOf the bat symbol The platinum duo's back on you hoes\n\n[Chorus]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model\nYou just hit the lotto\nUh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves\nNow where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?\nI noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us\nAnd ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust\nIt's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk\n\n[Verse Three]\nIt's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano\nYou never know what'll happen next, it may blow\nSame thing happens to the beats when Dre blows\nI talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll\nI get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player\nPimpin' hoes from here to Australia\nTill I get heart failure\nLook at ya half of ya'll, all scared\nOther half, hands up in the air, like \"Awww yeah\"\nThis is our year, this is what you call sheer talent\nBut I think at this point it's just obvious\nFierce, they say my music's good for all queers\nCuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears\nCall us the Mafia, we got the fucking mob here\nGimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year\nShit, I'm just doing my job here\nYou don't want no problem, do ya?\nFuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya\n\n[Chorus]\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model\nYou just hit the lotto\nUh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves\nNow where's the rubbers?
