Why the fuck you countin' for?\nA thousand chores try to get up my allowance more\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller + Sample]\nIncompatible\n(But still they say)\nIt don't matter no\n(I just tell 'em I'mma do me, ya know?)\nCuz someone's bound to hear my cries\n(Hater can hate)\nSpeak out if you do\n(But I'mma make music. Period)\nYou're not easy to find\nIncompatible\n(The High Life)\nIt don't matter no\n(What?)\nCuz someone's bound to hear my cries\n(Most Dope)\nIncompatible", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
