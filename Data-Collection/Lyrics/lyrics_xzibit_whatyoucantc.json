(me, me)\n\n[Hook]\nLet me roll somethin' witcha\nLet me smoke somethin' witcha\nLet me light this up\nLet me blow somethin' withca\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo all my niggas drinkin' Cool-O\nGettin' bent in prison\nWatchin' the game, they can't stop us from livin'\nI was givin' the direction but I never took it\nThe path was crooked and cracked so I learned to cook it\nIt's the black ?, the world on his back\nAnimal instinct, adjust to my habitat\nAny situation, react\nYou get manhandled and slapped down, mean not fuckin' around\nI think big like the heart that rests in my chest\nFuck punk motherfuckers that pray for my death\nNiggas want me to show love, but ain't none left\nWon't speak no names, I won't waste my breath\nGot too much stamina, too much energy\nStrengthen capabilities to crush my enemies\nAnd that feelin' brings me peace and tranquility\nReal estate, power, sports cars in Italy\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can read me in the magazines\nOr watch me on the TV screen\nIf you ever tryin' to take for me\nThat's gon' be the last day you breath\nNobody here rides for free\nYou fuckin' with a real O.G\nI stick 'n move like a young Ali\nYou can't hit what you can't see...(me, me)\n\n[Hook]\nLet me roll somethin' witcha\nLet me smoke somethin' witcha\nLet me light this up\nLet me blow somethin' withca\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnother nigga like Xzibit just can't be found\nI eliminate dead weight slowin' me down\nDon't know how to back down only hold my ground\nCheck the resume\nThey just cock it and spray\nYa'll niggas just sloppy and gay, get hit with a K\nStand trial for murder and lock me away\nThrowin' bows like Anthony Pillar\nFor my foes, bullet hoes through ya clothes and that fake Chinchilla\nFor all my niggas in the hustle, celebrate ya life\nFucking Bush administration tryin' to take your life\nX man exchange the data, hate the hater\nHit the earth so hard leaving cracks and craters\nNiggas wanna spend money on hats and gaters\nHoes in Vegas they gotta have chrome and dames\nBut don't wanna do a third of the work\nI built an empire from dirt\nI put you in a world of hurt...fucker!!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can read me in the magazines\nOr watch me on the TV screen\nIf you ever tryin' to take for me\nThat's gon' be the last day you breath\nNobody here rides for free\nYou fuckin' with a real O.G\nI stick 'n move like a young Ali\nYou can't hit what you can't see...(me, me)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fce1e2b08952b1596484d7ea9ce00db2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
