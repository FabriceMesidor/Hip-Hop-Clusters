Wanna kill me, but I'ma kill you\nNow watch me fuck just a little while longer, please, will you?\nThis is revenge, no dap before you die\nAnd despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry\nI'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, motherfucker\nClick, boom-boom, see your ass in hell\n\n[Chorus]\nOne, two, X is coming for you\nThree, four, better lock your door\nFive, six, get your crucifix\nSeven, eight, don't stay up late\nOne, two, X is coming for you\nThree, four, better lock your door\nFive, six, get your crucifix\nSeven, eight, don't stay up late\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I speak you better listen, the harder it gets, the more follows\nAnd I'm hittin' 'em with shit that they can't all swallow\nI keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow\nKeep motherfuckers like you, not seein' tomorrow\nI will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you\nLet you slip up, just once, then I'ma wet you\nStretch you out like a limousine\n'Cause where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killin' means\nFuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'\n'Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'\nNiggas started somethin', but they chose not to finish it\nSo I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cause I'ma win this shit\nFuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques\nAnd I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax\nGimme slugs for my gats, gimme hoods for my rats\nGimme wood for my bats, then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real\n\n[Chorus]\nOne, two, X is coming for you\nThree, four, better lock your door\nFive, six, get your crucifix\nSeven, eight, don't stay up late\nOne, two, X is coming for you\nThree, four, better lock your door\nFive, six, get your crucifix\nSeven, eight, don't stay up late", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8314b41ccd0d9cc7825bc168024bdec2.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
