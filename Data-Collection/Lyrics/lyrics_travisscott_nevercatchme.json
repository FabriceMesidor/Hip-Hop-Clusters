I doubt it\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, no, no, no\nAll these diamonds shinin'\nAll this gold on me, all these foes on us\nHow do I dodge these zombies?\nThey want my soul from me\nKnow that I'm gone, but one thing:\nThey will never catch me\nFalling off, falling off\nNever catch me falling off\nFalling off, never catch me\nFalling off, falling off\nNever catch me falling off, falling off\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh) Right\n(Oohh, ohh, oohh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ed3f40694e7605550cd4495bc55bf5c.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
