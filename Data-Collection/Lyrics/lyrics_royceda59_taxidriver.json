(Yes!)\nAfter that, he's like \"It's a green light\nYou can weave right through, if you got keen sight\nTo make you a right then, head for the valley\nI'm Going Going to Cali Cali, uhh\nTrust me, Mo Money Mo Problems\nEspecially when you built for the stars\nYou rather be, drivin your taxi than killed for the car\nSo drop me on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard\"\nI take him to the place he requested\nI tell him thanks for the message, the cab shakes when he exits\nI pull off Hypnotized then hear shots\nAnd then my engine die soon as they kill Hop\n\n[Outro]\nWhat's on your mind? Who's in your back seat?\nDo you go off your own thoughts? Are you even drivin your own car?\nI know what you thinkin, \"This nigga sayin Hip Hop is dead\"\nDon't take song like I'm sayin we lost Hip Hop, take it like I lost my mind\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the taxi driver\nRidin around with me and my thoughts\nIn the back seat behind me speakin\nTo me while I'm drivin, I'm hearin 'em talk\nTo me sayin' where they wanna go\nSoon as they get in and they close the door\nAnd then I cruise to wherever we ridin'\nWherever you can imagine from coast to coast", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f26afa0e15f73eb0b5cef561ec304c68.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
