Kelly couldn't touch the kid\nAnd even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid\nI got a pool that I never even swam in\nAirports that you bitches never land in\nThey be like, \"What you doin', Nicki?\" Brandin'\nSuck a cockpit, prepare for landing\nI'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley\nI keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley\nWhy these bitches so pressed, B?\nOpen my trunk, all I gotta do is press B\nI'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes\nI'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat\nGo my way to make a billi like a big goat\nPull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat\n\n[Hook: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\n\n[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]\nWant another round? Well, then get the ref!\nGot the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next\nWhen I fly, you know G5 is the jet\nI'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth\nMeetings with the president of every network\nThat is what the fuck I call how to network\nMy net worth, that net works\nKeep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work\nChillin' with executives\nCheck the charts, all my winnings are consecutive\nTrillion dollar deficit\nBut y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit\nBitches ain't got punchlines or flow\nI have both and an empire also\nSell out shows out in Norway, Oslo\nThis is the Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low\nFlow's sick, I'll slap a patient\nI'm checking these bitches like an application\n'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation\nSo it's off with your head, decapitation\nS-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman\nI do the hiring and I do the firing\nThat boss shit that you talk, I live it\nAnd I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot\nBitches\n\n[Hook: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\nWe are going up in flames\nOne more night for us to burn brighter\nWe are going up in flames\nOne last time for us to go higher\n\n[Outro: Rene Rowe & Amoy Levy]\nGoing up in flames\nGoing up in flames", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9119b40ac4f77d46423c94fbe6ca4a96.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
