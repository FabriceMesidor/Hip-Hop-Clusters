You know me dawg\nMan you know I ain't fake no moves, play no games at all\nI ain't one of these other niggas out here who finna cater to y'all\nMy window open, I get back in there, I'm taking it all\nOnce and for all, these niggas tell tall tales\nBut when all that fails, I be praying for em\n\n[Hook]\nHelp me Jesus, take the wheel\nHey, help me Jesus take the wheel\nGod help me, man\nLord knows I don't want to go to jail again\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know what you're thinking, you see me drinking while I'm drivin\nSpeed by, with the top down, been smoking, I ain't even high\nGot a six figure watch on, hangin out the window, stones singin\n20 carot solitaire on my pinkie, yeah I got that nigga slipping\nSomebody say \"you trippin\"\nHey TIP need to keep a chopper with him\nBanana clipping, I better listen\nSometimes life lessons aren't learned from self\nTryna get burned to death\nYou should only be wide-eyed off profits you can earn for self\nTelling you you'll fall asleep tryna take mine\nNo nap time, just flat-line\nYou could reach for mine, and my gat find\nYou better check that shit\nNigga stand down, you might not know my background\n\n[Chorus]\nI think I'm out my mind, people say I'm trippin'\nCause I raise hell everywhere I go\nI'm on 285 in my old school, same old tude'\nIt be like, \"Tip saying some shit,\"\nI know\nBut I believe in God, and I know he be with me\nEven when my mission isn't righteous as it will\nHow many V12 fast enough to pop a wheelie?\nDriving reckless everywhere, but I got Jesus at the wheel\n\n[Hook]\nHelp me Jesus, take the wheel\nHey, help me Jesus take the wheel\nGod help me, man\nLord knows I don't want to go to jail again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a3af1ad50f638f4b221d88c280afff5.680x680x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
