Which?\"\nOne day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch\nI was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah\nI swear my story just like big fish\nI've seen hoes, I was always just like \"Which? Which?\"\nOne day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch (Uh)\nI was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]\nAnything is possible if Gucci can do it (It\u2019s Gucci)\nTractor trailer full of kush, bet Gucci could move it\nUsed to drive a Buick, now a Rolls Royce (Right)\nI'm the young hoes' choice that make the old hoes moist\nAll these millions separate all the men from the boys\nAll these wars I went through, felt like a soldier deployed\nI'm the trap god but I give the glory to God\nIt's a knife on my K and my tongue is a sword\nI'm the plug and the cord, get it all in accord\nWhite rings seasick, Gucci went overboard\nHublot surfboard, brought sand to the beach\nAll white tux on, brought the church to the streets (It's Gucci)\n\n[Interlude: Gucci Mane]\nYeah, Chance the Rapper, Guwop the Trapper\nHuh, we just out here leadin' by example\nYeah, stand for something and fall for anything\nKings and Queens\n\n[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]\nI swear my story just like big fish\nI've seen hoes, I was always just like \"Which? Which?\"\nOne day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch\nI was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah\nI swear my story just like big fish\nI've seen hoes, I was always just like \"Which? Which?\"\nOne day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch\nI was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/102754ce389c900531057dd11508c674.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
