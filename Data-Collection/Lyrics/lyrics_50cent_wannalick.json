BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)\nYou know you want me you probably wanna lick this (BO!)\nGirl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (BO!)\nI'm busy man I be handlin' my business (BO!)\nBut we can get our freak on some quick shit (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nTonight's the night shorty you'll never forget this\nI dim the lights, I get it right I'm like a pimp sick\nDown on the bed, I make the clothes disappear quick\nI see through her (?) La Perla pretty clear kid\nI'm turned on now I really wanna hit, kiss\nHer neck and nibble 'til I'm way down on her waist kid\nMan she's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off\nWhen she come in with a friend I'm like \"Take it off!\"\nI got a fetish for the cheddar, yeah I'm rich bitch\nThat don't mean I'm runnin' 'round buyin' chicks shit\nYou see the chrome doubt be shinin' on my new six\nMy pinky ring, my neck, my ears and my wrist lit\nI like the ice I'm pretty nice on the dice trip\nTwice in a row you know, I got to get the dough\nMy confidence is high, I know I could hit a lick\nMy g's pretty good, I know I could get the bitch\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & 50 Cent]\nYou know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (BO!)\nAct like it's christmas and put me on your wish list (BO!)\nWhen it go down I'm a help you blow your whiskers (BO!)\nPut your lips on my lips and taste my honey (BO!

BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]\nI'll be your wife, I'll be your girl, I'll be your mistress\nBut if you ain't spendin' that dough your gettin' dismissed\nThat mean you gotta keep me laced like a seamstress\nYou can't expect nothin' less from the Queen Bitch\nMy doggy style make you wanna jump on that (BO!)\nJust like a dog on that chase for the kitty kat (BO!)\nMan he's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off (BO!)\nHe pour the honey on me, and then he clean me off (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)\nI take his breath away, Kim leave 'em speechless\nI'm so wet, I'll have a nigga feelin' sea sick\nHe in the streets all day but it's alright\n'Cause he'll be back tonight, and then the next night\nAnd then the next night, because the sex tight\nI'll be his Advil, I gotta keep his head right\nHe outta town and he fiendin' for me every night\nHe's so addicted sendin' for me on the next flight\n\n[Chorus: Lil' Kim & 50 Cent]\nYou know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (BO!)\nAct like it's christmas and put me on your wish list (BO!)\nWhen it go down I'm a help you blow your whiskers (BO!)\nPut your lips on my lips and taste my honey (BO!
