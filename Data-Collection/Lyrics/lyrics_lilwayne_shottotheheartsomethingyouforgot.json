Bang\n\n[Refrain]\nYou've been hiding, never letting it show\nAlways trying, to keep it under control (I see you hiding it mama)\nYou got it down, and you're well on your way to the top (You doin\u2019 your thing)\nBut there's something that you forgot\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]\nYou forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring\nI remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing\nI remember the love right after the fights\nYou can\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember those nights\nAnd if I would cry, you would cry twice\nTo me you were the brightest star under sunlight\nTake away my title, take away my stripes\nYou give me back my girl and you give me back my life\n-Give me back my girl and you give me back my life-\nSee this is just a nightmare so I blink twice\nOpen up my eyes hoping she\u2019d be in my sight\nI remember the time I wish I can bring it back\nWhat she means to me is what I mean to rap\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]\nBut I hope u haven\u2019t forgot about me\nUp in the living room watchin sports center\nYou were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner\nBut the lord is a forgiver\nYou know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered\nAnd your boyfriend is not like me\nWhy \" Ma you even went and got a tear drop like me \"\nI remember we would sit at home all day\nYou called me butter, I called you baby\nMy momma asked about you, my partners did too\nI know your daughter will be so amazing like you\nAnd I know you probably wish you never met me\nAnd I just wish you never forget me\nAnd let me say, please, don\u2019t worry about the women I have been with\nNo engagement can amount to your friendship\nAnd I hope that nigga know he got a queen\nAnd all I can do is dream. Damn\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 4: Rick Ross]\nI shed tears \u2018cause I'm told that they\u2019ll heal\nTo tell the truth I don\u2019t know how to feel\nNever felt alone in a room full of friends\nGot big plans but you leave 'em in suspense\nPray for me, patience wait for me\nPay dues, trust me they ain't comin\nWay back it was hoops, now it\u2019s Maybach coupes\nAnd we all took a vow, no squares in the loops\nNow we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room I'm laughin, cause it\u2019s lookin like a cartoon\nNever snitch, got it tattood by kartoo?\n(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 5: Rick Ross]\nFlippin' through magazines, ridiculed for my life\nBut they keep takin' pictures of my jewels in the light\nHundred g\u2019s in the night, entertain big timers\nCause my one-liners rule these dynamers\nSmellin' Ros\u00e9 on my breath, an ex-brisco fell asleep in his bed\nHabits we developed livin' lavish stackin' mail up\nClothes come from big n tall \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\nGot live life, I'm tryna live life\nPenthouse for a pimp, only drove the Benz twice\nConvertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours\nGet fifty collect calls from dawgs behind bars\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 6: Rick Ross]\nFortune and fame are pleasures you couldn\u2019t fathom\nBut fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace\nBenjamins by the pallet, I'm spendin \u2018em mighty daily\nI know I'm under surveillance ( I look at it as a talent)\nMillions I gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin I'm such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)\nI started without a coin, not knowin which way I'm goin\nNow I'm chatering boeings n readin a few poems\nWeathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light\nAnd I never felt this way bout anything in my life\nDetermined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets\nHow many people you blessed is how you measure success\n\n[Refrain]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f903dae2533e450c8d3cb233aa846020.745x745x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
