That brother struck again\"\n'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage\nTape by tape and page by page\nWhen the crowd is moving I compete with the mix\nThe rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets\nDeeper and deeper - I hope you understand it\nI made it up myself and I planned it\nFor other MCs who waste time\nWriting jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme\nI cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating\nThe rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking\nThey wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'\nTo get up on the microphone and then start takin'\nControl of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it\nSo hug the speaker - your ear's a magnet\nAttracted to a freestyle put in effect\nYou listen to the man while you're sippin' Moet\nSo Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight)\nGive me a scratch, turn my mic up a little\nI want you to hear this perfectly clear\nCatch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?\nI hope you knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished, this song\nThe rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f102814939a97eb3a27e9e27da36c213.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
