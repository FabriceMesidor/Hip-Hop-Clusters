And feed 'em, cause I don't need 'em\nI won't join 'em if I can beat 'em\nThey don't understand my logic\nTo my gat to my money and I'm hooked on chronic\nI never wanted to hurt a nigga\nUnless ya come flexin' that trigga, I dig ya\nThat grave on the east side of towwwwn\nLay ya six feet undergrounnnnd\nFrom man, to the dust to the ashes\nAll I remember tell me where the cash is\nClick-clack, barrel at my dome\nGive all your loot or you ain't goin' home\nBut I ain't goin' out with a bang\nWa da da dang, wa dada daa dang\n\n[Hook]\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nMotherfuckers be drivin' me up the walls\nHopin' that I fall but they can lick my balls\nStraight jacket, strap it\nIn a padded room when some punk niggas can't hack it\nDistracted from all reality\nNow I'm let out on a minor technicality\n(Ahhh) They all fucked up now\nCause they let a nigga back on the streets somehow\nI'm lookin' for someone like me\nLivin' in my own world to my own degree\nOn the loose in the city lookin' at the ho wit' the big titties\nLookin' at me and I feel shitty\nA little tensed up gettin' hot\nCause she looks like my girl who got smoked at the crack spot\nI'm tryin' to find ways to cope\nBut I ain't fuckin' round with the gauge or a rope\n\n[Hook]\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's drivin' me mad inside\nI'm havin' illusions, all this confusion's fuckin' me up in my mind\n\n[Outro]\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\nI'm havin' illusions\n\n[Produced by DJ Muggs]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/05081a10b4aaa2a1d10f8ab1c10a10c8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
