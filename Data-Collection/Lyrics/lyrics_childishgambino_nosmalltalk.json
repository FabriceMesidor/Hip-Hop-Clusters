Cheese like a camera\nSpendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford\nI'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'\nIf it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?\nGhost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper\nFlow so cold, watch them haters get asthma\nAnd every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one\n\n[Hook: Kari Faux]\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\n\n[Verse 2: Kari Faux]\nThree cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em\nWhy would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'\nSpendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)\nGot a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans\nAnd he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'\nAll my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy\nRap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy\nI got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi\n\n[Hook: Kari Faux]\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\n\n[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]\nYoung Bino, we be mobbin'\nYou don't see me, I'm on an island\nThese haters left us no choice\nLeave the trap like so moist\nLittle rock like dope boys\nOh my God, I'm out of fucks\nColombian but she ain't a plug\nThat's racist\nIn '96 I had K-swiss\nYou 96 with some fake bitch\nAnd I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language\nHead game so Cambridge\nGod damn, you dirty...\nYou were lettin' me bust in it\nBut if they ask I plead the fifth\n\n[Bridge: Kari Faux]\nOk this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nMake it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding\nGot a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans\n\n[Hook: Kari Faux]\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk\nBitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77a2349de407b4d4690746b19b39f6dc.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
