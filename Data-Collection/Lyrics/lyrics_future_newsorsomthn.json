Heard that the Feds got 'em\nI seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side\nGold Rolex, better check your peripheral\nIt's a full moon in the middle of the day\nGot them wolves out, rock a little Cartier\nGot the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade\nKnow a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday\nTell them young niggas grind\n'Fore you gon' knock someone down\nIf they gon' shoot, then shoot something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something\nMan down over yonder\nYoung came through holding on the cane like a drummer\nThey done took a boss out nigga, no wonder\nNiggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder\nHoes getting X'd out and we on ganja\nThe police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothing\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nHad the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex\nHigh definition glass on my pinky finger\nNiggas swimming in the water, no paddle\nNiggas trying to walk in my shadow\nThe bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel\nTold a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella\nTold a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella\nYou can turn this off and I can kick it acapella\nWe work the frontstreet where mama said \"Don't go\"\nWe went there\nTrap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there\nShawty don't fuck with these folks, these\nNiggas be telling these days, be telling these days\n\n[Chorus]\nNothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms\nWhere ya man at? Heard that the feds Got 'em\nI seen ya cruise the Land Rover through the west side\nGold Rolex, better check your peripheral\nIt's a full moon in the middle of the day\nGot them wolves out, rock a little Cartier\nGot the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade\nKnow a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday\nTell them young niggas grind\n'Fore you gon' knock someone down\nIf they gon' shoot, then shoot something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something\nWe better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something\nMan down over yonder\nYoung came through holding on the cane like a drummer\nThey done took a boss out nigga, no wonder\nNiggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder\nHoes getting X'd out and we on ganja\nThe police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothing\nTrue to these clips, niggas won't say nothing\n\n[Guitar Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c00186e6bb7f0fc65b9fa39efe8391f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
