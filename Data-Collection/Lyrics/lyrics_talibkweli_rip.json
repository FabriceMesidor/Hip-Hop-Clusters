Wet my fingers and just stick 'em in the socket now (Please)\nI'd rather be dead than watch wack shit\nColor me gone, fill in the dirt, tell 'em I kicked... ten buckets\nAnd it's all your fault, I'm rotting\nShouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking\nHuh, it's all your fault I'm rotting\nYou shouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Talib Kweli]\nWhat is it? ... What, is you tryin to lose your life?\nAncient wisdom like Druids but I'm foolish on the mic\nFlow the truest, undisputed cause I do it how I like\nIt's the crack so the fiends' lips is bluish from the pipe\nNice try, you ain't fly, you lying on the ProTools\nYeah, your vocals mighta flew but you local like Q\nApplying these old rules to new dudes don't work\nEven though they softer than yogurt, and covert\nIf you don't work you don't eat\nYou fuck around and get higher than a nosebleed seat, try to compete\nYa done beat yourself before ya even started\nE'rybody knows you don't go full retarded, bogus artists\nRock the stage, you going off the page and making no sense\nThe way I do these rappers so ugly the flow is grotesque\nYour flow is Kotex, it's no contest\nYou a foe, unidentified flying object\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8740213e0cdc34c6e3e40fae561a8310.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
