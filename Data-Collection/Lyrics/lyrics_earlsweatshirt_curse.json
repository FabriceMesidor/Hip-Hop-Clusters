What's the protocol?\nI keep my toe from out the serpent's jaw\nListen, I don't know who hurt you Ma\nWhat I know is living in the past just hurt you more\nAnd now I'm grown, I'm tryna bag 'em like the grocery store\nA lot of niggas poultry, I see chicken and I roast it all\nA nigga living in the moment, no remarks, just a question\n\"Why you looking for some innocence you know you lost?\"\nEngine running, pistons spitting like it's motocross\nShould the sunset, got the city golden\nPlus my son said I'm the city golden boy\nI've pissed and spit on my opponent\nThen I'm pitchin' bodies overboard\nAnd then I'm shaking off them shackles\nI be in the house sometimes, I own my masters\nCatch me on the couch unwinding\nIf she throw the cat, I'll smash it out the linen\nOff a pack that my Uncle Al provide me\nEyes on low rider, back to business man\nThey low-fi so don't mind 'em\nFarm 'em for they cheese not they co-sign\nAnd knock 'em out they motherfucking socks when you clothes-line 'em\nNot tryna change the game, don't sign him\nMotherfucker", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abe116b40a921476ff1094726c8d1a8.608x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
