Rap niggas trying act like they punk rock\nTight jeans, Mohawks screaming \u201cfuck cops\u201d\nY\u2019all should get your fucking nuts chopped\nYou all look like you suck cock\nBust shots if you hate me\nYup that\u2019ll fix the problem\nPut me out there, leave it up to Mr. Goblin\nTo contribute to all the bullshit that\u2019s dropping\nSo he can take his kids out Christmas shopping\nLook at the niggas I'm spinning circles around\nMy verbal profound lyrics make them hurdle the town\nThey washed up 'til they gurgle and drown\nTheir whole dynasty I\u2019m burning it down\nFunk Volume, you\u2019ve heard of it now\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuicide, (huh?) trust I might\nTell 'em what my motto is fuck my life\nDon\u2019t need alcohol to upper-cut my wife\nSo much rage I could crush my mic\nSee I woke up on the wrong side of the bed\nMy brain works but the whole left side of it is dead\nThere\u2019s a little small gremlin inside of my head\nAnd lately I\u2019ve been feeling like I'm living life on the edge\nBut wait a minute, this ain\u2019t a gimmick, I can\u2019t pretend it\nI\u2019ma scream it loud to the world just in case they forget it\nBe careful of some of the knowledge that you take from critics\nThey tryin' to execute a nigga but I stay committed\nNew topic, mind over matter\nNever needed my arms to climb up a ladder\nYou wack niggas don\u2019t ever show signs of a rapper\nIt's getting too serious for you? Why, what\u2019s the matter yo?\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, the black man\u2019s back\nThere is no topic my raps can\u2019t smash\nThe state of hip hop that can\u2019t pass\nIt\u2019s all full of shit like a fat man\u2019s ass (eww)\nMay I please have just enough trust\nIn you motherfuckers to leave the rust of us stuck\nI turn my head and now you're messing stuff up\nAll that \"You! Turn it up!\" Just shut the fuck up\n(Damn) I\u2019m rude and I'm so wicked\nI\u2019ll make sure you never blow up\nLike a balloon with a hole in it\nI knock hustlers for a living, got muscles for the women\nGot puzzles for the children, blaow\nPlus I got a sick delivery, that\u2019ll have you niggas shivering\nAnd stunned from bombs I drop lyrically\nYou can\u2019t touch my shit\nSo I\u2019ma end it just like this\nSuck my dick!\n\n[Chorus]\nI kick the bitches out\nAnd let the girls in\nYour baby daddy shouts\nYou stole my girlfriend\nYou see I\u2019m on the prowl\nI make the world spin, round\nWelcome to the pain in my life\nYeah baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/44b49d0de2559bbc3b7d62a3cabcc0da.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
