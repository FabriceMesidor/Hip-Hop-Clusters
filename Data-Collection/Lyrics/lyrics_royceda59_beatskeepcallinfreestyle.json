Bobby Krissy\nOr Bobby, Whitney, flow K-Ci, JoJo\nLet the Tech N9ne go KC, MO., bro\nI don't stand my ground, I just demolish niggas\nSimple you against me you ain't ridin' with me\nBitch not only do I kiss and tell\nI'm Orlando Brown when I describe them titties\nI'm the rubberband man, but I do more than count bands\nFuck sipping 40 ounces, I'm sober out here\nFucking hoes like 40-ounce Van\nNigga I'm Pusha T doing quiet numbers\nGetting silent money, I'll retire from it\nI don't dress loud, I throw the flyness on it\nLet the labels talk and Desiigner mumble like Donald Trump\nThrowing money hitting everybody and they auntie up\nTrying to find someone to come perform for me 'fore I fuck the whole entire country up\nI'm the first one gunnin', last one runnin'\nToo enlightened for a check (yeah)\nAny rapper that want it, I'm Wack 100\nInvite 'em to a scrap (yeah)\nI narrow down shit the Farrakhan way\nYou can find me anywhere the crime wave\nI'm Schwarzenegger, you Sarah Conner\nAnd your favorite rapper act like Eric Andre\nRyan's still alive, played nice 'cause the drama still flies\nEven when you shoot your little Uzi vertical in broad day\nLike you still tryna kill God\nI'm French kissing with a \"bitch you\" mentality\nVoodoo and como talle vous\nWhile I'm hula hoopin' dollars for that snarly tooth\nMy future look like juju in a body suit\nWhen you niggas gon' admit it?\nThat I'm better than the youngins\nThat I'm better than the legends\nNever did I dumb it down or did I settle\nI'm Rick the Ruler in every different measure\nI ain't just the R, I'm every different letter\nI can give your chick eleven inches if she let me get the leverage\nI can be president if hip-hop would just let me switch endeavors\nAnd I'm just having an open workout in Heaven\nTryna get me a good sweat\nI'm Jae Millz looking up at the sky like, \"Ayo B.I.G, am I good yet?\"\n\n[Part 2: \"Lockjaw\" Remix]\n\n[Interlude]\nWhen you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya\nThey keep callin' ya\nThey keep callin' ya\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'\nMy parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'\nI'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'\nAnd anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe dogs keep barkin' at the top dog\nThey already lost it, nigga, it's a lost cause\nI remember when I had to pawn all my jewelry\nWas so embarrassed by the help that no one offered to me\nZoning off the bottle, we only taught to fight back\nWe only talk survival, walking home, we just might scrap\nAll we did was write raps, tryna get so drunk\nHad to get my sight back, product of the old gun\nMade some bad decisions so early on in the process\nI had people out to get me, my album wasn't even out yet\nI'm talking 'bout the self-proclaimed \"King of Detroit\"\nI seen some people reaching they dreams, some people destroyed\nI seen people die at the hands of the violence of man\nSeen people shot out the sky, being fly as they can\nSeen 'em split the pie up and Pam sniff her entire two grams\nSlipping, now we in your crib to tie up your fam\n'Cause it's hard to really focus when you're tryna stack for ya\nLawyers, with those in power tryna blackball ya\nIt's hard to find employers like accountants that's loyal\nWith those who told ya they adore tryna back-door ya\nYou ain't on-point though, one minute, you popping trunks\nNext minute, you happy man, next minute, you sloppy drunk\nEvery January 1st, the ball keeps droppin'\nAnd I'm just celebrating it at the mall, we shoppin'\nCelebrating friendships, \"Bro\" this, \"Cuz\" that\n\"Fam\" this, borrow that, loyal this, trust that\nComas after comas that were alcohol induced\nIf I ain't wake up from 'em, I won't ask what y'all would do\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it's hard to understand me 'cause my jaws keeps lockin'\nMy parents keep callin', the Lord keeps watchin'\nI'm standing on the corner with my boys, beat boxin'\nAnd anywhere I go, all of these whores be jockin'\n\n[Refrain]\nI had to bite down, bite down\nA nigga had to bite down, bite down\nAll I could do was bite down, bite down, down\nBite down, bite down, I had to\n\n[Verse 2]\nHundred yard dash through the hood, talking money runs\nUsing that money counter, getting rid of them funny ones\nYou know the ones, too wrinkled to go in them slot machines\nThrow 'em on the titty bar floor to lower a thot esteem\nYou could be the hottest thing and still have the wrong team\nSometimes to see the bigger picture, you need a wider screen\nI got the arm out the black beatle, beating the drum\nMannequin challenging whole families, viva la drunk\nIt's Nickel Season, the fever's begun\nI'm savage, even though my tat issa knife, I'm keeping a gun\nLoaded cartridges, stolen cars with the Lowenharts\nRip the game apart and you are not worthy like Wayne & Garth\nBy now, my life's so righteous, I don't even sleep with groupies\nI move like that nigga Spike Lee when he was Mookie\nBack in high school, I really clowned\nI said I'd do the right thing if Rosie let me ice cube them titties now\nBut this is realer than movie depictions\nWhat you niggas know 'bout making a move in a beef and truly committin'?\nIt ain't no squashing it after you push a certain button\nMake sure everything under your lip cut and your shirt is tucked in\nBurning your beard away with Magic Shave\nCOs frisking your pregnant bitch, turning your kids away, thataway\nThat'll in a shallow grave, casualty of a cabaret\nDaughter calling some wack nigga \"daddy\" at movie matinees\nEven when we deal with Saturdays, my children still know that\nI don't want another man's cheap-ass ways on my doormat\nAnd anything I do from legal to illegal\nI do this shit the ski mask way, like I'm Lil Kodak\n\n[Outro]\nWhen you a fiend for the rhythm and the beats just keep callin' ya\nThey keep callin' ya\nThey keep callin' ya", "image":
