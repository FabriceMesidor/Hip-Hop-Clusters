When you're raised in the streets\nAll I really want is to get praised in the streets\nAnd he who lays in the streets with your last breath\nAsk the Lord for forgiveness and you may have a fast death\nIt's not like me to have my back turned to open places\nI wanna see it when it's comin, so I can open faces\nOpen cases got me payin to stay out of jail\nWhile these streets, got me to prayin to stay out of hell\nSlipped, and I fell, got back up - slipped again\nBut no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win\nIt's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good!\nProject nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood!\nKnew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it\nSeein niggas havin a good time, so i'ma ruin it\nFuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!\nFrontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!\nWhen push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu\nNow peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you\nEverybody knows you can talk all day\nBut when it's on what you gonna do - walk away?\n\nOne love Boomer, rest in peace, baby!\nDark Man X, DMX", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c048ed75e001e7462e2f3445177e4821.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
