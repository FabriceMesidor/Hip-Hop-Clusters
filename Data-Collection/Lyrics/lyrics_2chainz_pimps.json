At the rhythm of a bass drum\nHit the club buy the bar like a star take that other nigga bitch like dare that nigga say something\nI seen pimps and you ain't one, you're not close to me I'm everything a real nigga supposed to be\nYou act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave\nAt her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game\nShe devoted to the notion of roller coastin', and that won't change\nWith my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega\nFill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators\nYeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper\nForever pimping, never slipping, forever recruiting these top notch hoes in the majors\n\n[Hook:]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82908e72685ad4d4fa667a2842fbd939.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
