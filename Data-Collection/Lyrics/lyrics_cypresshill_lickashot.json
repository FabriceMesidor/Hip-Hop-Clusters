You can't hang\nFlash back on the skills when I used to bang\nOn the corner\nI'll warn ya\nGonna roll on ya\nFool\nHit ya with a golden rule\nDon't turn your back on the street\nWhen I hit that corner, feel the concrete\nIf ya push that by like nothin'\nWatch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden\nBlastin' at these fools with a passion\nLook at the Glock when it's time for some action\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm\n\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm\n\n[Verse 2]\nSunday morning\nWake up it's stormin'\nRaindrops fallin' on my head it's pourin'\nCats an' dogs\nPigs in a wagon\nLookin' for the Afro - one that's saggin'\nScooby-Doo\nAn' fucked down too\nPloy me\nDon't let your punk ass try me\nGonna take more\nThen you better call your backup team\nAnd wait for the crew\nI'm the one flippin'\nKeepin' the clip\nOn my hip an'\nJust watch your back if you're slippin'\nOooo\nWhere did that .22\nCome from\nWhen the bullet past through my lung\nI've lost my breath I'm winded\nI've been hit, by a slug that wasn't intended\nI hear thunder\nI wonder\nIf a nigga like me's goin' under\nTake a number!\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm\n\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm\n\n[Verse 3]\nHad a bad dream\nWoke up in a casket\nNow I can't even get back at the bastard\nBull-shit!\nThis pine box\nAin't strong enough to contain the Afro Marx\nCritical bell rings\nSnapped out the dream\nWhat the fuck's up with the funny red beam\nPointin' at me\nI got no strap G\nWhat now: gotta duck, they're gonna gatt me\nBam, I feel numb\nWhere did the shotgun blast come from\n\n[Chorus]\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm\n\nLet the gatt hummm\nLick a shot!\nSo I let the gatt hummm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55015ba5da54d99c8523f3f5d67bd795.300x263x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
