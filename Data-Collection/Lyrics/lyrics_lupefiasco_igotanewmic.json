You ain't got the answers\nLike Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n(Waves, waves, waves...)\n\n[Outro: Lupe Fiasco]\nAhh man, that's good right there, that's a good mic\nOh we gonna have a nice, nice lil' career together, me and you lil microphone\nYou know what I'm talking about? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
