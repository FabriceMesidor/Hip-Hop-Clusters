They kicked them folks out\nAnd moved them around every chance they can since\nSo scared of homelessness, but ignoring them ain't gonna change it\nAnd tearing down the 'jects ain't gonna make your ass safer\nFor all that paper wasted just to build up Safeco\nWhile Garfield High School still remains like a slave boat\nWe gave up on hope, a long time ago, so\nI wake on this floor, after pacing hours before\nMind racing like a child torn in war zones\nWith every side challenged\nNeeding to manage and understand this balance\nI can't fall or falter\nBrother, I'm just an author\nAnd no amount of words offered has ever been enough to alter this system\nSwallowing souls broke\nMy own folks roam upcoast\nHolding dreams close of what America was supposed to be\nBut works for the rich only\nThis Southend in reality\nTook my family back to what they was running from before\nWhen they left that war\nSame shit, different continent\nHome don't exist anymore\nHome don't exist anymore\nThe 206 that raised me just ain't the same, yo\n\n[Sample]\nAll those moments\nAll those moments\nAll those moments will be lost, in time\nLike tears in rain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
