Some people call it instinct\nI like to call it my luck, who gives a fuck\nI'm stuck, in this environment and can't depart from it\nAnd if I try I always end up back where I started\nPlan A, square 1, there's no escapin'\nSo I've come to realize my truth\nTryna live my full life before my time is through\nClocks tickin', so I don't got no time for you\nAs I head outside, amongst the rest of the animals\nIs where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand still\nIt's sorta like a family bond\nWe gather up all the soldiers and form into an invincible\nSwarm of kids, now it's on again\nDrinking straight from the bottle warm gin dripping down my chin\nFor the crippled children, you can't win against 25 niggas bent up with mac 10 semi-automatics, fully-addicted crime addicts\nSo long as there is cash involved, I gotta have it\nThere's many different levels to the criminal mind\nEither you in it for the money or you wasting your time\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nMy destiny will be the death of me\nForever loving my peoples\nHustling, It's only right, nigga we struggling to survive\nIt's only crime that provides for me\nSo I resort to puffing dimes and dreaming of pushing a ride\nNegative thoughts fill my brain but it's the projects to blame\nNiggas forever getting loot while standing out in the rain\nSo when the sun shine, nigga will be writing a rhyme\nAnd if a nigga owing, blood is how I'm taking mine\nAs I climb the ladder, of success with TEC's\nThough I rather not have to watch my back get threat\nBut it's like that, so I adjust, fuck getting touched\nYour man wasn't aware, that's why that nigga got bucked\nI realize open my eyes once this shit got real\nThere's mad drama on the Hill when niggas getting blue steel\nI love my niggas for that, we keep it real, get loot\nAnd our identity is Timbs and army certified suits\nMost def, my people hold me down whenever in beef\nTalking all that bullshit but it's the gats that rules the streets\nSurvival of the fittest automatics recommended\nGiven a life sentence to crime until my life is ended\n\n[Hook: Prodigy & Havoc]\nNiggas wanna point guns in my face, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nNiggas forever talking shit, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nTry to jam me on pack, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nNiggas running out their mouth, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nHow we do it, how we do it\nWe taking ours in blood. (x2)\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nThis city got me trapped like an animal with criminal thoughts\nI can't seem to turn away from this unknown force\nIf only I can lay my hands on the source of my trouble\nAnd maybe I can heal my scar before it bubble\nIt's like a plague, and there ain't no cure\nWe absorb this world's filth, therefore we're un-pure\nMy life is like a bad dream I can't seem to shake\nOnly my peoples who are equal understand or relate\nThe way we live is never planned, it just happened that way\nSo until tomorrow I'll just be surviving today\nIt's just another man, on this planet living for delf\nPops gone, I had to learn to be a man myself\nBut I, don't stress that\nHe did his dirt, now he pays back waiting in a federal laid back\nPops, times is different and things ain't the same\nIt's worse than ever, to get paid we do whatever\nSee some rather achieve goals and be a scholar\nI rather get locked like you, earning a 6-digit dollar\nMaking the desert bird holler\nDoing white collar crimes, but the fed time is hard to swallow\nAnd digest so I protest the pen\nI rather die before the jail cell sucks me in\nAnd my peoples we all share the same thinking\nWe in synch, on the same tempo, making cowards run petro\nPull out the TEC, automatic metro\nMy shots chase you 'round corners\nLeaving your family a bunch of mourners\nAnd my all-around point as that\nIf you feel me you're guaranteed something you can feel back\n\n[Verse 4: Havoc]\nKid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me\nYou tried to blow me your weak side just showed me\nStepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,\nDidn't see my crew around so I got bent for self\nI had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9\nIt was a Friday night [?] had it bad one time\nCause niggas getting bagged on a regular son\nD's like \"Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,\"\nSo I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking\nNiggas be ass talking then convict them of extortion\nHold myself down the only way I know\nNiggas pumping packs for free, in debt cause they owe\nStreet life is like a trial, ass out if you blow\nThe maximum is death son you know how that go\nLye got me on point, paranoid for life\nThat's why I walk the street with heat especially at night\nI represent the North side I hold the title with pride\nAnd when its on, I use the infra-red for guide\nAim it at your temple, with no remorse and never sentimental\nMy crew is cold-hearted from all the foul shit we been through\nSurviving shootouts, bullets hitting the fence sparking\nFuck my fingers, with guns niggas I'm marking til the blocks darkened\nDoing my thing, let my gun clap\nIt's like that!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
