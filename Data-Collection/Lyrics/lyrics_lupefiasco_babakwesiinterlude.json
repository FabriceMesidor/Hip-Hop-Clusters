Mission Ambassador. Don't ruin us. God said, \"Be lifted, be gifted, be spirited. Be you.\" The worst form of imprisonment is the imprisonment of the mind. For those confined within their mind, knowledge of self is the key. Love will set you free and let you be you. Wise eye always open. Never blind to self. Be you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aa1a0cb9e9a473ce83eb531fa78079.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
