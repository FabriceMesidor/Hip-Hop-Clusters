Come on, bounce!\nI said come on bounce!\nEverybody in the house doin' mass {amounts (Me!)}\nTo the women in the thongs with their asses out (Oh)\nWe don't bull{shit}, better ask around\nD12 throws the bombest bash in town\nBizarre, your mom is {crashin' out}\nHelp me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out (Come on)\n\n[Verse 2: Kuniva, Kon Artis (& Eminem)]\nBump that, someone help Denaun\nHe's upstairs wrestlin' with Elton John\nHey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?\nThey gotta be {Tums, the Ex-Lax} is gone\nYeah, I took 'em {all, dawg,} with some Parmesan\nAnd I think my arm is gone \u2014 No, it's probably numb\nYoung, dumb and full of {cum}\nAnd I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue\nScary-ass, it was a false alarm\nYou think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?\nWell, stop actin' stupid; you so {high}\nThat you might wake up with a {guy} on some new {shit}\nYeah, I think I {did} too much (Huh-uh)\nI think I got the runs (Huh-uh)\n{Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums}\nWatch out, here it comes! (Ha-ha-ha!)\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI've been to many places\nI've seen so many faces\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\nI've climbed the highest mountain\nOnce or twice, but who's countin'?\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nDirty Dozen, eighty of us\nShady brothers, ladies love us\nThat's why our baby mothers\nLove us but they hate each other\nThey probably wanna take each other\nOut and date each other\nSome, some, some\nSomethin'... I don't know\n\n[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]\nHop hills, hills I hop\nHop two hills, on stilts I walk\n{Snort two lines} that were filled with chalk\nThought I was incredible and {killed} the Hulk\nI wanna {roll} away like a rollerblade\nUntil my {eyes roll} back in my skull for days\nAnd when I'm old and gray, yo, I'ma go for broke?\nNo? Okey-doke, {I'm packin' my nose} with soap\n(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?\nHad an accident when the Trojan broke\nAh, poor baby, born by a {whore} lady\nNow I'm payin' child support? (It's your baby!)\n\n[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]\nI take {four shots} at one time\nAnd I don't need to chase when I'm swallowin' mine (Hey, you got any room?)\nIn Bizarre's hatch back\nWe can't go far, 'cause the car has flats\nWhy the hell you people think I rap?\nBecause my mother taught me how to breach contracts\nAnd if you got cash, then hide it so (Swift, chill!)\nI'm just tryna get by like you\nAnd I don't give a damn if you find me rude (Huh-uh)\nMean, crude, to hell with you too (Huh-uh)\nI only need three {blunts} and I'm cool\nI just got some and I'm goin' back soon\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI've been to many places\nI've seen so many faces\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\nI've climbed the highest mountain\nOnce or twice, but who's countin'?\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\n\n[Verse 5: Bizarre]\nI'm at a rave, lookin' at a babe\nLike she want it\nGin and tonic demonic\nBody smell like vomit\nLooney, crazy, jumpy, sexy\nDopey-headed guy\nWhipped cream, dirty mattresses\nWanna try? (Go on)\n{Blue hills, golden seals}\nGot Bizarre actin' ill\nDrugs kill \u2014 {Yeah, right!}\nChick, I'm for real!\nShut yo' mouth, you dirty girl\nYou know you want me in your world\nLadies, please don't fight\nBizarre's here all night!\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nI've been to many places\nI've seen so many faces\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\nI've climbed the highest mountain\nOnce or twice, but who's countin'?\nBut nothin' compares\nTo these blue and yellow purple hills\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nDirty Dozen, eighty of us\nShady brothers, ladies love us\nThat's why our baby mothers\nLove us but they hate each other\nThey probably wanna take each other\nOut and date each other\nSome, some, some\nSomethin'...
