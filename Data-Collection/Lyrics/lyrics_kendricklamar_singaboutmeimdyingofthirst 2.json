lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [Gunshots]\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, \u2019cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Outro]\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n\n[Part II: \"I'm Dying of Thirst\"]\n\n[Produced by Skhye Hutch]\n\n[Skit]\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

Is that what I think that is?\nI know that's not what I think that is\nWhy are you so angry?\nSee, you young men are dying of thirst\nDo you know what that means?\nThat means you need water, holy water\nYou need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord\nDo you want to receive God as your personal savior?\nOkay, repeat after me:\n\"Lord God, I come to You a sinner.\"\n(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)\n\"And I humbly repent for my sins.\"\n(And I humbly repent for my sins)\n\"I believe that Jesus is Lord.\"\n(I believe that Jesus is Lord)\n\"I believe you raised Him from the dead.\"\n(I believe you raised Him from the dead)\n\"I would ask that Jesus come into my life.\"\n(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)\n\"And be my Lord and Savior.\"\n(And be my Lord and Savior)\n\"I receive Jesus to take control of my life.\"\n(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)\n\"And that I may live for Him from this day forward.\"\n(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)\n\"Thank you, Lord Jesus\nFor saving me with Your precious blood.\"\n(Thank you, Lord Jesus\nFor saving me with Your precious blood)\n\"In Jesus name, amen.\"\n(In Jesus name, amen)\nAlright now, remember this day\nThe start of a new life \u2013 your REAL life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f3db37bb8953d6e671d8bb532da2e855.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
