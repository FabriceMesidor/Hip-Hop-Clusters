Man, I\u2019m in this ho\nLife is moving fast: where the fuck do all these minutes go?\nMixtape dropped, then I started getting 10 a show\nNow I get a hundred: what the fuck you think I\u2019m in it for?\nYoung Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree\n\"Fuck you\" to the haters that just spend their time attacking me\nShout-out to your girlfriend, nigga, lately she distracting me\nWondering if I\u2019m the best? Well-I-am: no Black Eyed Peas\nGirls wanna fuck your niggas\nNiggas gotta wanna be you\nLining up around the block so that they can get to see you\nI feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to\nYou can say whatever, girl, but we just don\u2019t believe you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f0a4980c8ef838036229e1d4dcd036c.408x408x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
