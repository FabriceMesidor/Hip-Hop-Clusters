What did that nurse say?\nBrain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake\n\n[Chorus]\nFor all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you\nTo all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too\nTo all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past\nBut the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass\nFor all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do\nTo all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too\nFor every time I reminisce, I miss my past\nBut I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18fd7ff1ba2db7ae16a26498fc58bb64.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
