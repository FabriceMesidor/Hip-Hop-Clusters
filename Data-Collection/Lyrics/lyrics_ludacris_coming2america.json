Welcome to the United States of America! Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses! Hailin from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay: Ludacris; Disturbin' Tha Peace family. Recognize royalty when you hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this nigga's earring. Luda, throw some grapes on these peasants!\n\n[Ludacris]\nThese bitches throwin' rose petals at my feet mayne!\nThey wanna spoil me, treatin' me like royalty;\nWhat I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang\nWork that track, whip 'em like Kunta\nThat's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda\nBy way of A-T-L; if you disagree\nDon't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail\nWith no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly\nIt's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli\nUh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles\nAnd testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles\nMy rap career goes back further than your father hairline\nIt's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines\nI'm fly, even when I get high I work cash\nAnd even got my coach bumped up to first class\nI'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle\nCause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies\n\n[Unnamed Man #2]\nMan fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man. I'm tired of this shit man. Man I try to rap for the nigga, I try to get on a nigga tracks; he ain't hearin my shit. Man, for real! Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga; man that nigga garbage. Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't hearin me. Man iii-iiiis this shit on? 'Cris, c'mon 'Cris. 'Cris, f'real man. FUCK YOU NIGGA, MAN FUCK YOU!\n\n[Ludacris]\nFuck you too! What you wanna do?! Scrawny nigga\nBut I got a arsenal of automatics down to twenty-twos\nKnow how to use 'em, fight dirty as SHIT\nI throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a CLIQUE\nYou see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos\nAnd comin up shorter than five Danny DeVitos\nI'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos\nWith five strippers, four wives and three amigos\nI go scuba divin in Bays at Montego\nI find gold links and snatch 'em, like I'm Deebo\nBut I'm the light-skinte-ted version, of Mandingo\nI've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo\nI used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO\nCause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle\nOld asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled\nAnd I stay with more BULLETS, than yo' Billboard singles\n\n[Unnamed Man #3]\nHo, that is just too much! You just gotta give applause! He is definitely all f'real - yaseeI'msayin? Ha ha I be fuckin with him all the time, yahhmean? I'm sayin, I used to just serve homes herb, now how come through, he want 50's a purple. He want quarters a purple now. I want y'all to trip with it. Man, I done sold him a QP last week of the flava, yaseewhatI'msayin?\n\n[Ludacris]\nYE-AH, can I get a little hit of that, little nigga with a bigga sack\nC.P. set a bigger trap look at that Godby Road and Old Nat\nWhere they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know\nShady Park you heard just don't go\nQuick to flip the bird up po'-po'\nMakin the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!\nGotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people\nI gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll - oh no where the beat go?\nBring that, shit back, didn't wanna hear that, clik-clak\nTons of fun with guns\nFuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that\nWho knows, who goes there? Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear\nStop and stare; pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare\nI'm on, FIRE! And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!\nOh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!\nRight down the avenue, passin you rapidly stackin\nIn the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action\nCamera, LIGHT LIGHTS, throwin a punch and then FIGHT FIGHT\nPackin a lunch and then BITE BITE, A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT\n\n[Unnamed Man #4]\nI'm just tryin to save ya shorty! I'mma let you know it's real down heah! When you ride down that 285 and you go past Cascade, get ready to go past that Campbellton Road 'fore you get it to Camp Creek, shorty, just shake; 'cause dat where dem real niggas at!
