Ice cut it out!\nEvery time we attend somewhere, you act real terribly\nYou shit on niggas too much, you start to worry me\nYou switch up, last week you burned a old lady's retina\nI thought them thick Coke bottle jammies might protect her\nBut it didn't Pah, the lady's blind and it's all your fault\nIt went down to jury court and you walked\nOn stage you fuck with nigga's faces, glaciers\nHittin' off with Cristal bottles, bing wind up in the basement\nVery expensive championship\nChipped rocks stone for his wedding day, bitches give you props\nLook you tied a knot, understand you hot; you got my man popped\nIn the most famous era, like when \"Paid in Full\" dropped\nWaves and blue tops, raise the roof off the coupe\nThem days, the black and red MJ's, I was loose!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f4093661813b3ac25f7c044e4b1e305d.899x899x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
