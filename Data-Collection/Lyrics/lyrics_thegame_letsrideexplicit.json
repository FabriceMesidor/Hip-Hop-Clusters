Everybody, let's ride\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath\nSomebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at?\nYou fuckin' on the first night? Meet me in the back\nI got a pound of chronic and a gang of freaks\nMove bitch, who the fuck you think they came to see?\nThe prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of the D R E\nTake a picture with him and you gotta fuck me\nAnd you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve\nGot somethin' on my waist, say 'You can't touch Eve'\nThat's my gangsta bitch and like Crips and Bloods\nI'm in the club on some gangsta shit\nSo nigga, twist up, light another dub\nBitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club\n'Ain't Nuthin' But A G Thang', baby, it's a G thang\nBounce like you got hydraulics in your G-string\nI fuck a different bitch seven days a week\nHit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath\nNiggas thought I wasn't comin' back, look at me now\nHoppin' out the same cherry 6 4 with the motherfuckin' top down\nI'm The Game, nigga, call your bitch\nShe ain't home, she with Game, nigga\nRemember that, Dre? You passed me the torch\nI lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray\nRidin' three-wheel motion 'til the ass scrapes\nTurn Sunset into a motherfuckin' drag race\nNow watch it bounce, hit the switch\nLet it bounce 'til the police shut the shit down\nWhen you hit the club, tell 'em you came with me\nWe gon' twist up in the V.I.P\nIt's a new day and if you ever knew Dre\nMotherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre\nSame Impala, different spokes\nSame chronic, just a different smoke\nIf I could fit the whole hood in the club\nHop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back\nI turn into a strip club\nCall it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass\nIf I could fit the whole world in the club\nTell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch\nPop bottles and twist up\nRoll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c29ee407cd2d88f01ce08743e61d3b1.614x614x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
