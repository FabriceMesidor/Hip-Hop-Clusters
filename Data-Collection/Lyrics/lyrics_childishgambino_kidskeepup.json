Man, you bathin' in apes\nFindin' you's like findin' Asians I hate\nBut they say I got a fetish, nah, I\u2019m skippin' all of it\nBlack and white girls always come wit' a set of politics\nThat\u2019s all that I was sayin', I\u2019m a proud man\nThey wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan\nHer name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus\nAnd she\u2019s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don\u2019t notice\nThere ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see\nSo I make her take Plan B in front of me\nWomen talk shit on men like all day\nBut it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways\nThey too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ\nThey too busy trappin' pros like Kobe\nThe only thing I put before me is \"Do, re\"\nIf you had told me the truth, we\u2019d be ok\n\n[Chorus]\nIf we were kids, I'd want to give\nYou everything that you would want\nThose other boys, they give you toys\nBut all they wanna do is\nKeep up, keep up, keep up, keep up\nThat's all I want, keep up\nKeep up with me, keep up\nKeep up, keep up, keep up, keep up\nThat's all I want, keep up\nKeep up with me, keep up\n\n[Outro]\nIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s okay\nIt\u2019s alright, it\u2019s okay, girl\nIt\u2019s okay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00196af444633a4108e6dc544358985e.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
