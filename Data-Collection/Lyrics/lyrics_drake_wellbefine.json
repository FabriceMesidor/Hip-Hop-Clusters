Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time\nAm I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine\nWe\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine\nAre you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time\nAm I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nUsed to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man\nLoved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man\nYou keep talking that, \"You was this and you had this\"\nAnd you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it\nGot a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line\nAnd the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time\nYou should take it as a sign, man I got it right now\nI wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now\nLet's be real about this shit, can I take you home?\nOr come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?\nI heard you got your ways, I never would have known\nShe said, \"you're such a dog\", I said, \"you're such a bone.\"\nI've been everywhere, where you know me from?\nThese days women give it to me like they owe me one\nBut they crave attention, though, they always saying, \"show me some\"\nBut girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one\nAt least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that\nThen, fuck, let's get it then\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nI'm trying to let go of the past\nShould we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh\nBecause it's hard to say no (say no)\nYeah, it gets hard to say no\nAre you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time\nAm I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine\nAre you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time\nAm I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine, We\u2019ll be fine\n\n[Outro: Birdman]\nYeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!\nTake Care of the business, nigga (shine on these niggas)\nGive these niggas the business, nigga!\nKill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!\nYeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit\nToronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas\nDrizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?\nToast to this gangsta shit, fellas\nOVO YMCMB (believe that!)\nYeah, you understand me?\nPlaying with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing\nThrowin' hundreds, rubber band stacks\nThat YMCMB shit, nigga; flashy lifestyle\nOne hundred", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50b0608affc94c4dae3d502a65ea390.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
