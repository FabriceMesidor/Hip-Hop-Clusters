Why we always gotta spar for?\nWhy the cops always gotta get called?\nWhy you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?\nI guess some things will never change\nLocked in the cycle, tryna break the chains\nHandcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins\nThis what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me why you don\u2019t love me\nWhy you always misjudge me?\nWhy you always put so many things above me?\nWhy you lead me to believe that I\u2019m ugly?\nWhy you never trust me?\nWhy you treat me like I don\u2019t matter?\nWhy you always kicking my ladder?\nWhy you never hearing my side to the story?\nNever look me in my eyes, say sorry?\n\n[Outro]\nBecause Amerikkka don't love me\nWhole country turned on me\nIt's no love in the city for the homie\nJust a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me\n'Cause Amerikkka don't love me\nWhole country turned on me\nIt's no love in the city for the homie\nJust a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me\nBecause Amerikkka don't love me\nWhole country turned on me\nIt's no love in the city for the homie\nJust a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me\n'Cause Amerikkka don't love me\nWhole country turned on me\nIt's no love in the city for the homie\nJust a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me\n\n[Outro]\nOkay, okay you red, white and blue\nNow you no good Miss America\nHow you like this shit, huh?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84b143545e0338f7b7459bb9ab8ecca4.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
