thing, so If you owe one fifty on it\nYou hit you a juug in the street, take them a 40 lump, now you owe one tenth\nWe refinancing this year, we paying everything off\nLet's get in touch with all our debt owers\n\n[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]\nAyo D, we go foreign silly\nJust my section might throw a billy, operation buy back the 60's\nGentrify the whole innercity, genocide the whole innercity\nNiggas buying up every belly\nInvestments [?]\nRoundtable tryna campfire\nTold my niggas they was vampires\nNever let 'em say jay finished\nOne strip mall got eight bidders\nBuild brands like Sean Diddy\nHuman hair coming from the East, niggas sellin' bundles [?]\nBy any means niggas gotta eat\nFat Burgers niggas gotta eat\nCrenshaw since \u201985 got Jay Z off TMC\nEvery tape do a million plus\nSo tune car got ten up\nContracts not retroactive, big word but you get the message\nBig checks go get the Checkers, we call it Rally\nYou call it Checkers\nI fuck with wings but I'm not investing\nTell Rozay that I'm tryna network\nPop the trunk now, make the set work\nJames Brown gotta do your leg work\nJames Brown you gotta do your leg work\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nI'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\n\n[Verse 2: Slim Thug]\nWhen bosses link up they make boss moves\nTryna buy a hundred houses tired of buying jewels\nI done played with mills I'm tryna touch another digit\nTired of looking cool ain't nothing left to do, I did it\nBoss Life construction, fuck it buy my whole hodd\nWhen OG Johnny got the old hood lookin good\nUsed to sell bricks now we sellin' brick homes\n[?] so we switched and got our hustle on\nMoney long, tryna own my whole city, mane\nStart off with a block, we already did it mane\nAin't no loss, everything [?]\n[?] bank and give my people homes\nThinking longterm, thinking like a boss\nBefore you shine gon' fix up your momma house\nBuy back the block, it's time to open up shop\nBoss up, [?] from bottom to top\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nI'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\n\n[Verse 3: E-40]\n(We gettin' money since Moby Dick was a goldfish)\n[?], real estate\n[?] mansions in the south, interest rate\nI can make the booger sugar bounce (boing)\nI used to have the sack in the droughts (coins)\nMore hop than a kangaroo pouch\nI think I might franchise a Ralph's\nOur Whole Foods are sproused\nLoyal to my soil like a spouse\nMy diamonds twinkling, her pussy tingling\nI'm dipped in gold, I'm kinging\nI'm bonafide, he falsified\nThat nigga told, he singing\nBitch I'm the shit like I'm lactose\n[?]\nBosses, lieutenants and admirals\nTacticals, choppers and calicos\nIn the Bay tryna get boxed that's why I stay hot\nThe cost of living is high\nEveryday my people die\nLord knows I try, I see they tears in they eyes\nI come from nothing to something\nAll of my life I been hustling\nMe and my bro's at the top\nWe gon' buy back the block\nBIATCH\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nI'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\n\n[Verse 4: Fat Joe]\nTake the jet up in NYC\nCouple J's and some jeans to match the Balmain tees\nBout to buy back the black\n100 bricks in the trunk\nLeave 'em layed in the pavement, you know we slayin' the Bronx\nAnd now I'm sorry, I been killin' these niggas\nNow I got me a complex and I ain't feelin' these niggas\nI just took a vacation, I had a pool by the beach\nIn the mediterranean [?]\nPut the streets on my back, now I'm back in them streets\nUsed to pack a Mac in the back of them Cadillac seats\nAnd that's word to Big Punisher, I be sonin' these niggas\nIn the dome with the roof gone, the sun's on a nigga\nBet that leather reclining and them diamonds be dancing\nBout to buy back the block and build a 30 room mansion\nWhen that money be talkin' you know I gotta respond\nI'ma make me a Belly and go buy bacl the Bronx\n\n[Verse 5: Rick Ross]\nFED's follow my cars call me a person of interest\nThe Lord is my witness that I have perfect intentions\nGod is the greatest, he keeps me under surveillance\nPowerful statements was such a wonderful cadence\nThe housing was public, my mother's love was amazing\nNeighborhood, violence and devil, never complained to the mayor\nTrash on the corner, be in the bundles contagious\nAnd all the blunts I be blowin' [?]\nBusiness endeavours, we killers forever\nI need [?]\nAll the homes that I own, I open my doors\nFor ones that I call my own\nAnd pray you do it with yours\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the block, buy back the block\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nIt's time to buy back the hood, buy back the hood\nI'm 'bout to buy back the hood, buy back the hood",
