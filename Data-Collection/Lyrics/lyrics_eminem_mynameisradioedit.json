My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\n\n[Intro]\nExcuse me!\nCan I have the attention of the class for one second?\n\n[Verse 1]\nHi, kids! Do you like Primus? (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)\nWanna see me stick 9 inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh huh!)\nWanna copy me and do exactly like I did?\nTry *** and get messed up worse than my life is?\nMy brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight\nBut I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate\nAnd Dr. Dre said \"Slim Shady, you a ***head!\"\nUh-uh! \"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!\"\nWell, since age twelve I felt like a caged elf\nWho stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail\nGot ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off\nKissed 'em and said \"I ain't know silicone was supposed to be this soft!\"\nI'm about to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass\nFaster than the fat man who sat down too fast\nCome here, lady! \"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!\"\nI don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off\n\n[Hook]\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn)\nThanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35\nI smacked him in his face with an eraser\nChased him with a stapler, and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)\nWalked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up\nServed the bartender, then walked out with the tip cup\nExtraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship\nWhile they're screaming at me, \"Let's just be friends!\"\nNinety-nine percent of my life I was lied to\nI just found out my mom does more *** than I do\nI told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper\nMake a record about doing *** and name it after her (Here mom!)\nYou know you blew up when the women rush your stands\nAnd try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans\nThis guy at White Castle asked for my autograph\n(Dude, can I get your autograph?)\nSo I signed it: \"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!\"\n\n[Hook]\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 3]\nStop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)\nDr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!\nI'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die\nI'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive\nAm I coming or going? I can barely decide\nI just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid, dare me to drive? (Go ahead!)\nAll my life I was very deprived\nI ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)\nClothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk\nI spit when I talk, I'll *** anything that walks\nWhen I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits\nHow you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no ***!\nI lay awake and strap myself in the bed\nPut a bulletproof vest on and tap myself in the head\nI'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)\nAsk him if he bought a porno mag to see my ad\n\n[Hook]\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?\nMy name is, chka-chka Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh?
