It's a brand new era!\nThe world revolves on an economic axis\nAnd if it slips, everybody drips\nBlack and white in a fight for green\nWhile the yellow and red get caught between\nWannabe gangstas livin a lie\nGettin rich while they glorify genocide\nHomicide, suicide, politicians tounge-tied\nWestside, Eastside\nWhat's the difference? If you ride, you ride\nIf you live, you live but if you die, you die\nAnd I...\n\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out, ha!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n\nUh! Gimme mine, give it up\nGive it back, I can't let it slide like that (Nah!)\nEverybody want a free ride\nAnd most of my fake-ass friends got snake eyes\nReady for a fight to the death\nProtect the innocent, 'til it ain't none left\nHomeboy - guilty, homegirl - guilty\nWho are you to play judge and jury?\nFilled with fury, the wrath of a tyrant\nWho's to blame when the young get violent? (Uh!)\nWhen the Glock cocks, it pops, many drop\nAnd if his momma get him help, will he stop?\nDangerous, walkin' on the edge\nNo aim to us, stop blamin' us!\nFor the rules that you made, games that you played\nSeems you got it made, why are you so afraid?!\n\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Watch out now!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n\nHarlem, Bosnia\nChurch burnin, the Middle East\nNo justice, no peace\nGangsta rapper, now deceased\nAnd what can we learn from this?\nEventually the guilty burn from this\nIt's a universal threat\nTime bomb tickin, the clock is set\nGeneration X, live and direct\nThe Constitution, execution\nEmancipation, annihilation\nInferior rights for all stereotypes\nAmsterdam got bright red lights\nNew York's the apple, Hollywood's the dream\nLl Cool J must see cream!\nRed Hot Chili Peppers down with the team\nFrom the cradle to the grave, we will sing this theme!\n\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! C'mon now!\n(Back on up!) Ha! I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules!\n\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Ah!\n(Back on up!) Ha! I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n(Back on up!) I make my own rules! Check it out now!\n(Back on up!) I'm my own man, I make my own rules!\n\nBreak it down!\n\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules\nMake the rules, break the rules!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c926f0febcb4d6b315fa8fb350fe253e.494x494x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
