Rap like I'm mincing meat\nCall me Lou, if I'm on the track, these niggas skip to me\nNiggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me\n50s in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth\nVince be with the rocket, he gon pop it when it\u2019s danger round\nFingertips to tapers now, salute us when you face us\nGive a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/79df1d18a8b46756cc7a7a92b095d409.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
