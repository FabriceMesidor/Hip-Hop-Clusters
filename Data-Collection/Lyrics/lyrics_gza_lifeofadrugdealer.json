Richard Roundtree\nThe only difference, my guns are sound-free\nSilencers ring off then wisp by\nThen all you hear is a last minute cry\nOf those who tried to control my territory\nNot the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story\nPolice be giving me eye-to-eye contact\nBut I smile cause I'm putting out contracts\nNow a G-note is placed upon ya head\nYou say picture that alright, bang ya dead\n\nThis is the life of a drug dealer", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
