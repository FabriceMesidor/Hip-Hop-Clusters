This shit is even new to me (Word)\nI got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece\nOf this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day\nBut I swear this the beginnin', I be dreamin' every day\n\n[Chorus: King Marie]\nI just wanna be a dreamer\nI just wanna be a king\nI just wanna get lost\nI just wanna be me, I just wanna be free\nI just wanna be\nI just wanna be\nI just wanna be", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3c242f72b054b6d20e2e8fd97f060d73.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
