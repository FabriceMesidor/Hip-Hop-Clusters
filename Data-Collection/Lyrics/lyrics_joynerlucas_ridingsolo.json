Everybody throw your hands to the ceiling\nTo the bass, ba-ba-ba-ba bass and you feel it in your motherfucking fingers\nWhat you know about Picasso? I think another picture being painted\nAnd what you know about drinking to the pain? All you do is get faded\nWhat you know about rapping all day and you dedicate your life to a dream that ain't paying and knowing there's a big chance you could never ever make it?\nThat's fucked up, ain't it?\nAnd what you know about waiting even if a nigga really impatient?\nI got love for the hood even though I wish I was really in Vegas\nWith bad bitches in the water, I be deep sea swimming\nTo wake up in the car with my windows tinted\nAnd you ain't seen nothing, nigga, you ain't seen nothing\n\n[Bridge: Busy Signal]\nWhat you know about money from the chop?\nHustling on the grind nonstop\nIn the street, but the heat make it hot\nLooking out for the cops on the block\nYou know nothing bout slanging them rocks\nTaking hits from nothing to the top\nLock it down and setting up shop\nGetting all that paper and stock\n\n[Hook: Busy Signal]\nDon't you know that I be riding solo?\nMaking money, staying high pure dro\nWhat you know about the dough that we blow?\nDon't play no games, I tell these niggas lay low\n\n[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]\nWhat you know about pain?\nWhat you know about living on the edge, ain't nothing gon' change?\nWhat you know about standing on the corner, tryna hustle all day?\nWhat you know about scraping up change so your supper get paid?\nAt your door, knock knock knock-knock-knock and your landlord banging for the rent\nWhat you know about waiting for a prayer that ain't never get sent?\nWhat you know about trusting nobody? We ain't never been friends\nYou ain't never shook hands with the fans\nI be in the bad bitches put they ass on my hands\nI be on that low soul, d-d-d-d-d-d-damn\n\nWhat you know about Joyner? (what you know about him?)\nNah, what they know about Busy? (Busy, what up my nigga!)\nDead Silence! Joyner!\nYou ain't know about it\n\n[Bridge: Busy Signal]\nWhat you know about money from the chop?\nHustling on the grind nonstop\nIn the street, but the heat make it hot\nLooking out for the cops on the block\nYou know nothing bout slanging them rocks\nTaking hits from nothing to the top\nLock it down and setting up shop\nGetting all that paper and stock\n\n[Hook: Busy Signal]\nDon't you know that I be riding solo?\nMaking money, staying high with pure dro\nWhat you know about the dough that we blow?\nDon't play no games, I tell these niggas lay low", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0f1ef72a727167faed7990bf3663ea4.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
