So I could be turnt turnt (c'mon)\nWhy do I grind? So we can floss floss (c'mon)\nAnd why do I shine? Because I'm a boss boss\nI do it for me and you... c'mon\nI do it for me and you... c'mon\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nI want you to visualize and just, look at the stage, look at the bright lights\nC'mon; look at the rage, look at the night life\nListen to a dope individual, not one of them niggas who flowin so pitiful\nHopin to get with you so when you payin' attention your focus is critical\nSnappin like a Kodak'll be, hope you get the picture, now Twista you notice I beast\nDon't flow after me, I'll eat 'em up and then say \"Bon app\u00e9tit\"\nAnd it'll be so depressin if I talk about everything that bother me\nMillionaires livin in the same country as people in poverty\nSo fuck you and your opinion, I'm on my own dominion\nStreet scriptures, hieroglyphics that ain't the book of the Gideons\nAn infinite era I'm in, travellin through a multiverse\nKeepin it smooth, I tell a motherfucker come insult me first\nCan I get ahead of us and I can see you be scared of us\nAnd you be talkin et cetera, et cetera, but everybody'll know what you spit is a replica\nOf what I do so I'ma just stay hot\nAnd I be makin the cash, and when she ask why I'm away a lot\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a82462c7648c262cd242217da588ea0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
