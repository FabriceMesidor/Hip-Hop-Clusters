Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?\nOr maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally?\nStill tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage\nI think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade\nParaphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade\nNothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid\nBut I'm a product of the system, raised on government aid\nAnd I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid\nJust a young black man from Compton, wonderin', 'who could save us?'\nAnd could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us\nSo many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis\nSome of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit\nNot all of us criminals but cops be yellin', \"Stay back, nigga!\"\nWe need a little bit of payback (Payback!)\nDon't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable\nDon't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done\nFuck you!\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anderson Paak]\nAnd the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day\nBut that don't make it okay\nAnd them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane\nBut you don't know our pain\n\n[Chorus: Anderson Paak]\nAnd please don't come around these parts\nAnd tell me that we all a bunch of animals\nThe only time they wanna turn the cameras on\nIs when we fuckin' shit up, come on\nAnd please don't come around these parts\nAnd tell me that we're all a bunch of animals\nThe only time they wanna turn the cameras on\nIs when we're fuckin' shit up, come on\n\n[Bridge: Anderson Paak]\nThese old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks\nI be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons\nRollin' up trees in the belly of the beast\nWhere the people disagree\nThe upper class eat, middle don't exist\nThe bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks\nAre you jumpin' on a fad, laying in a ditch?\nI be stompin' down demons, stompin' down quick, come on\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anderson Paak]\nAnd the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day\nBut that don't make it okay\nAnd them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane\nBut you don't know our pain\n\n[Chorus: Anderson Paak]\nAnd please don't come around these parts\nAnd tell me that we all a bunch of animals\nThe only time they wanna turn the cameras on\nIs when we're fuckin' shit up, come on\nAnd please don't come around these parts\nAnd tell me that we all a bunch of animals\nThe only time they wanna turn the cameras on\nIs when we're fuckin' shit up, come on\n\n[Outro: DJ Premier, Dr. Dre, & Samples]\nYeah! This is DJ motherfuckin' Premier!\nAnd I'm Dr. Dre (Dr. Dre)\nWhat, Premo! Yeah we fuckin' shit up!\nNo! We don't play no games here!
