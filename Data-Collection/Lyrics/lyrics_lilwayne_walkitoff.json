engaged\nYou can meet me at the alter when a nigga really dead\nEvery time I'm tryin\u2019 to leave she beggin\u2019 me to stay\nAnd I politely fade away like my name was M.J\nAnd she wrote me a note, guess what that note says?\nWell, I hope you still like me but I go both ways\nAnd then I say Oh, then I say Okay\nStabbed them up and got the fuck like my name was O.J\nIf you lookin\u2019 for some money bitch my name is no way\nNot tomorrow not today, not yes-terday\nI'm Mr. President as they say\nAnd that Phantom fits me like it\u2019s tailor-made\nI can take on a war, nigga bombs-away\nI been

but I forgot her name\nShort sweet, red cute, ole vibrant thang\nShe got a earring in her pussy, \u2018n\u2019 everywhere else\nShe said she jog everyday so she can cum on herself\nThen she tell me my love is the best she's felt\nAnd she sucked my dick like it\u2019s about to melt\nShe drink Vitamin Water, say it\u2019s good for her health\nShe can wrap my whole dick around her waist like a belt\nThen there\u2019s another bitch, her name was Ayesha\nShe ride that dick good and make a mean cheese pizza\nOne time it was so good, I told her to order one mo'\nShe said it\u2019s not Domino's -- its DiGiorno's\nThere\u2019s another bitch I met her at the Gong Show\nGot her to the crib and turned it straight into a thong show\nShe do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows\nShe do my dishes, wash my clothes and fix my corn rows\nI can't forget about my bitch named Meaty-boo\nShe\u2019s a young project bitch, I used to bring that hoe to school school\nSo I brung her to the school  we standing on the yard\nThe bitch asked me if I was from the 17th ward\nNiggas came out the cut and started muggin\u2019 me up\nI grabbed the clip out my pocket and made them cowards duck\nAnd I told my old lady \"I\u2019ll be back, you see\" and hit me up on my cell phone\nIf niggas lookin\u2019 for me, cause\n\n[Hook]\nI'ma good lookin' rapper I ain't tryin' to stunt\nI'mma good
