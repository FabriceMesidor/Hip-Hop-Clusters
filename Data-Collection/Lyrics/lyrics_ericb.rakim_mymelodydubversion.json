All of that can wait\nI won't push, I won't beat around the bush\nI wanna break upon those who are not supposed to\nYou might try but you can't get close to\nBecause I'm number one, competition is none\nI'm measured with the heat that's made by sun\n'Cause I'm playin ball or bobbin' in the hall\nOr just writin my name in graffiti on the wall\nYou shouldn't have told me you said you controlled me\nSo now a contest is what you owe me\nPull out your money, pull out your cut\nPull up a chair, and I'm a tear shit up\nMy name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for Ra\nSwitch it around, it still comes out R\nSo easily will I e-m-c-e-e\nMy repetition of words is check out my melody\nSome bass and treble is moist, scratch in and cut in a voice\nAnd when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice\nI wouldn't a came and said my name and run same weak shit\nPuttin' blurbs and slurs and words that don't fit\nIn a rhyme, why waste time on the microphone\nI take this more serious than just a poem\nRockin party to party, backyard to yard\nI tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods\n\nThe rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp\nI can swing off anything even a string of a harp\nJust turn it on and start rockin, mine, no introduction\n'Til I finish droppin science, no interruption\nWhen I approach I exercise like a coach\nUsin' a melody and add new verse(?) and notes\nSo when the mic and the R-a-k-i-m\nIt's attached, like a match I will strike again\nRhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped\nPut in a order to pursue with the momentum except\nI say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter\nA pause, but don't stop the tape recorder\n\nI'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor\nMelody arranger, poet, etcetera\nExtra event, the grand finale-like bonus\nI am the man they call the microphonist\nWith wisdom, which means wise words bein' spoken\nToo many at one time watch the mic start smokin'\nI came to express the rap I manifest\nStand in my way and I'll veto on the word's protest\nMC's that wanna be vissed(?), they're gonna\nBe dissed if they don't get from in fronta\nAll they can go get is me a glass of Moet\nA hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet\nI take 7 MC's put 'em in a line\nAnd add 7 more brothas who think they can rhyme\nWell, it'll take 7 more before I go for mine\nNow that's 21 MC's ate up at the same time\nEasy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doin'\nNo fessin', no messin' around, no chewin'\nNo robbin', no buyin', bitin', why bother\nThis slob'll stop tryin', fightin' to follow\nMy unusual style will confuse you a while\nAnd if I was water, I'd flow in the Nile\nSo many rhymes you won't have time to go for yours\nJust because of applause I have to pause\nRight after tonight is when I prepare\nTo catch another sucka duck MC out there\n'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe\nAnd after this you'll call me your majesty\nMy melody\n\nYes, my melody\nEric B\n\nMarley Marl synthesized it, I memorize it\nEric B. made a cut and advertised it\nMy melody's created for MC's in the place\nThey try to listen cuz I'm dissin them so pick up your face\nShook off your neck cuz you try to detect my pace\nNow you're buggin', almost doggin' off my rhyme-like bass\nThe melody that I'm stylin', smooth as a violin\nRough enough to break New York from Long Island\nMy wisdom is swift, no matter if\nMy momentum is slow, MC's still stand stiff\nI'm genuine like leather - inclined to be clever\nMC, you'll beat the R, I'll say \"Oh never\"\nSo Eric B., cut it easily and\nCheck out my melody...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/544b6274041065fc3d40982c5f03d4c6.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
