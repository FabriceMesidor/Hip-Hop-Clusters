Time to renovate\nBoy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight\n\n[Chorus]\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe the niggas who could have it all\nWe the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own\nSmoking one and got another roll\nCame a long way from no direction now to formation\nMore legit, more to make, more to spend\nGot a thing for champagne? Order it\nWaking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding\nListening to Dolomite rhyming, I\u2019m in\nExclusive bay, break you off something and I\u2019ve got moves to make\nDon\u2019t be acting bougie \u2018cause you came through with Nate\nNo Reuss, real nigga before Protools\nGot game from niggas that's from the old school\nBut we them new niggas,  you should roll through\nWoke up in the morning fucked up but that\u2019s part of it\nI got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins\n\n[Chorus]\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'\nCause we're the last free souls in the world on our own\nJust roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e168a843af4516427b50fafd226984ee.990x990x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
