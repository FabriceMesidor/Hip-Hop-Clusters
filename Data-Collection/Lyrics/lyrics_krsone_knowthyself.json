(yeah aight yeah) I'm ready to go\nLook\n\n[Repeat 3X]\nKnow thy self, and thou shalt know\nThe universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)\n\nGod is the mother, the father, the friend\nKnow ye not that ye must be born again?\nWhat does it mean to be in the world but not of it\nIt means you want the cars the cash the jewels the house but you don't love it\nIt means to taxes regulation state law you live above it\nIt means you a FREE hip-hopper, you ain't nobody's puppet\nYou don't see no money on me, you see it up in the cupboard\nYou see me up in Toys'R'Us, with my seeds cause they love it\nYou see insurance flash out, if my kids pass out\nYou see seven acres of land where we can all spaz out\nTo all my fathers that fathered, hold your head up for starters\nTeach your toddlers, not to be thieves and robbers\nThis that other kind of rap, that leads to true hip-hop\nThere's other kinds of raps, but they lead you to get shot\nThe choice is yours, you gettin older now\nYou got a kid comin, how you gonna hold it down?\nIt's one thing to be iced out and rocked up\nWhat's the point if you're gettin locked up?\n\n[Repeat 3X]\nKnow thy self, and thou shalt know\nThe universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)\n\nGod is the mother, the father, the friend\nKnow ye not that ye must be born again?\nIt's really time we seperate the young men from the big men\nThe young girls from the women, whatever the title that fit them\nMy style designed to open a child's mind when I spit them\nI only got a little bit of time to really rhyme and uplift them\nYou see them brothers talkin about that crime? Forgive them\nIt won't be long before they words manifest and they live them\nSometimes you gotta go back to the beginnin to learn\nAfter fifteen years I'm just BEGINNIN to burn\nTo all my true hip-hoppers, that pay bills and live proper\nNever allow a negative thought to stop ya\nCorrect ya posture, stand upright not uptight\nDon't be scared of the light, just prepare for the fight\nWe say \"Criminal Minded\", cause our thoughts are illegal\nWe represent the very thinkin of, inner-city people\nReal people, people that take care of theyself\nThey need health, love, awareness and wealth\nNot to mention, knowledge of God\nNot college, the job then dead - if you agree nod your head\nIt's one thing to be iced out and rocked up\nBut what's the point if you're gettin locked up?\n\n[Repeat 3X]\nKnow thy self, and thou shalt know\nThe universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)\n\nGod is the mother, the father, the friend\nKnow ye not that ye must be born again?\nC'mon c'mon yo, tonight is it\nWe gonna steal away together, through these rhymes I spit\nWhen the student is ready, the teacher, shall appear\nSo I'm here, but are you really ready to face your fears?\nMo' money, mo' money, is that your credo?\nYou've been livin in a dream world Neo, power to the people!\nNobody's equal, everybody's diversed and different\nMy lyric'll never cheat you, my verse is gifted\nSo manifest what you believe is God almighty\nIt could be Allah Jesus Krishna Buddha Aphrodite\nIt could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me\nIt's like at some point in your life you gonna have to hear me\nI represent them teachers preachers comin through your speaker\nManifestin another lesson to them true believers\nInstead of pickin up our women ready to mistreat 'em\nYou better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave 'em\nYou better teach 'em you better read 'em you better feed 'em\nThe system will defeat 'em if you don't teach 'em the cops'll beat 'em\nThe style that I be kickin quick is \"Edutainment\"\nHip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it\nInstead of rhymin about my history and what I been through\nI'd rather rhyme about awakening the God within you\nYo, it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up\nBut what's the point if you're gettin locked up?\n\n[Repeat 3X]\nKnow thy self, and thou shalt know\nThe universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)\n\nGod is the mother, the father, the friend\nKnow ye not that ye must be born again?\n\n[KRS-One]\nYeah.. yeah..
