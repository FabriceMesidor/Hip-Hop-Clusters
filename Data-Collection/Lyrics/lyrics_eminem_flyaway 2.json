You ain't even lukewarm\nMy puke's hotter than you, you're soft\nI use fire to cool me off\nI told them I would grow up one day and show them\nI'd be able to choke clouds\nPick up lightning bolts and throw them\nTake the world by storm with these words I form\nGeorgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it\nMake 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn\nSwoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowing\nYes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare\nI\u2019m so up, I\u2019m stuck in mid air, I\u2019m loving it yeah\nIt's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare\nThese haters are so pussy they afraid to be scared\nThis is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay\nThey spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way\nAnd leave this rap game with a bad taste\nAnd slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they\nSlap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it\nWe're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye\nAnd I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack\nHow's that for hind sight, what the track say?\n\n[Chorus: Just Blaze]\nSome people ask me, where I've been lately\nThey thought I fell off, nobody can save me\nThey play in the background, I don't back down\nSo don't get it twisted or try to play me\nFirst I come out, they underrate me\nThen I come back, they still try to fade me\nThey say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy\nThey ask what me I think and I say maybe I'll fly away\nAnd ain't nothing in the way so I may as well fly away\nThere ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away\nI know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon' die today\n'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go\nAnd the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below\nAnd there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away\nAnd there's nothing in my way so I may as well fly away\nI'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1e9148f22dd68e465355599f1d0253e6.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
