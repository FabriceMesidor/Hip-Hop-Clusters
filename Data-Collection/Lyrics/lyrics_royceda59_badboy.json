I'm on the cusp of greatness\nYou bum-ba-cluts fly, I'm on a fuckin' spaceship\nEnough in the bracelet to make the blind squint\nI'm Eazy, Cube, Yella, Dre, Ren times ten, I'm a (Bad Boy)\n\n[Verse 2]\nPut you in a slumber, come on bruh\nYou a bum, you under my umbrella, I put you in the dumpster\nWhatever, I ain't the Fella who you want Roc with\nI will batty boy kill ya, fuck all that dumb shit\nPut you up under concrete, I'm cut like a gauntlet\nBeat ya like a blum blum drum stick\nMumble something I come through dumping\nAK-47 pumping, blow like a trumpet\nThe foolishness of niggas bullshit\nWho you trying to push bitch? Booyakah, full clip, don dada\nYou no test me Shabba Rank impostor\nYou no want drama I'm prepared for 'Nam, I'm a (Bad Boy)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're in a headlock, tie your family up like a dread lock\nGong niggas like Junior Marley when the lead drop\nEat 'em like a meal while the fed watch\nYou married the street I just fucked it out of wedlock\nBefore I rip on ya, rasta should warn ya\nThey don't all love ya, push needles into the eyeballs\nOf a little doll of ya, blind ya, align ya\nRed rum with murder for hire, serve your supplier\nPill poppin' and coke snortin'\nWe kill for fun 'til we come for your fortune\nBad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do?\nWhen them killas come for you, I'm a (Bad Boy)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13187be577e518c77f5c6ac278ec366a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
