I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo\nThen spread slugs\nMy brain matter\nIs a brain fatter\nSee my vision\nOr my vision'll stare at ya\nThis is the future if I say so\nYall copping fitted caps\nI'm about to go and cop a halo\nThe God of rap and I mean it\nI play kickball with Mars\nAnd marbles with Pluto and Venus\nWitness the genius\nI interact with the inner city villains\nThat are into your circle\nLike a computer hack\nThen give you that (Haha)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
