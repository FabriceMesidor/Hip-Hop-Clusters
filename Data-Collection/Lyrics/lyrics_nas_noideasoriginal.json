Material, women, and large paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\nNo idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun\nIt's never what you do, but how it's done\nWhat you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\n\n[Verse]\nIf niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find\nWhere bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes\nGo to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard\nWhere weed's responsible for memory loss\nLet's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous\nSee what I seen every day I live with this torture\nLightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours\nSleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower\nMy tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons\nLong as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em\nThe hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl\nEverybody had money, every summer was real ill\nFour-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane\nNo Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned\nRadios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'\nAsk for today's mathematics, we Allah's children\nAnd this was goin' on in every New York ghetto\nKids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o\nWe coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference\nOn a different coast, but we share the same sunlight\nYou're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs\nWhile on my side, brothers'll murder for different things\nBut it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties\nStuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story\nFrom, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis\nThem treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias\nBe scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars\nNothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught\nCourtrooms, eagles and flags, American style\nWhile in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul\nWatchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child\nBut them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out\nThe chain be like a hundred K\nShinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute\nGenesis is deep, my features are that of a God\nIt's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas\nMy Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind\nEven with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams\nSi-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change\nCan't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things\nLike, somebody's always watchin'\nMy life before I, walk out the door I size up every option\nEyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns\nWhich is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one\nI mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled\nHeadline readin' \"Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6438e249e54997f8504fca57219b4738.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
