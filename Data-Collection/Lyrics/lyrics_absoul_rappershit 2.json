your own spit and ain't coming up with nothing\nI call this shit \"Rapper Shit\" cause I ain't a rapper\nBut if I was, this ain't some shit that I could rap after\nCaught up in the rapture, you call yourself a factor\nYou're lame, paving a way Bob could build faster\nI'm a real master, real massive, you just real average\nI see your chain, it's strange, they wore those in the Middle Passage\nAnd it's harder to play me than to fiddle backwards\nDon't act like you knew my tactics\nCause when it hits the fan, you know I stand last\nI see through your true colors like stained glass\nI see the fear in your eyes when we arrive\nAnd what's the odds of even thinking you coincide\nWhen every time a nigga open a door you go inside\nJust to realize, either you're weak or someone lied\nSee, you spend more time boasting about what you do than you do\nSo by the time your shit is due it's doo-doo\nAnd who knew that too cool fool who used to sit in the back\nWould slip through the crack, like dudes who went to rehab\nAb-Soul, Abstract Asshole\nBlack Lip Bastard, et cetera for forever\nI follow no ruler, even if I'm under a drastic measure\nBut whatever\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nThey say pressure bust pipes\nAnd I ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar\nSparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral\nOr colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms\nYou would test me but you know better\nIt's inadequate to go against the Jesus of Nazareth\nOf the rap game, and guess what, I got no cheddar\nBut my mind is like a wizard\nI defy the laws of gravity every time I get high and write a sentence\nBack teeth never been in agony, but I got wisdom\nI have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, Scorch ya, third degree burns next to their sideburns,\nAll sorts of combustible flows, firemen on speed dial\nFree the leaders of the free world with a freestyle\nFree the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now\nAnd feed off my feelings\nAs I control my wheel like new power steering, so sincere\nTryna duck court hearings but I got big ears\nRap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me\nNow they can't fuck with him, I'm wishing good luck to them\nReluctantly these critics loving me and I don't blame 'em\nThey say, Kendrick you gunning for these niggas\nSo when I pull my weapon out, I give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it\nAnd watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set\nI got now, I got next, give you nouns, give you verbs\nGive you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat\nI am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me\nBig homie fear young, buck cause when I buck I make more than a buck\nDollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time\nPut me in Alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart I know sun still shine\nStill got a skill to be found in a gold mine\n\n[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]\nI got an appetite for habitual liars on the mic\nWho with pliers couldn't get a grip on life\nI spit like I sat the tip of my dick on ice, and that's intense\nImagine if I had already came twice, ain't that some shit\nPass the swisher nigga, fill your cup with liquor nigga\nFly your kite till you're gone till November nigga\nShow 'em you remember nigga\nPour some Hennessy and Crown for your homie six feet underground\nSmoke an ounce and turn that frown upside down\nLike the triangle in the panties of my gal\nWhen Mike Jack made \"Raining in Moscow\" I had no style\nTommy Boy stocking on my scalp\nAnd that was like ninety-five, now it's twenty-ten\nTwo years away from when they say the world's expected to end\nAnd I ain't even begin\nThat's more ironic than a bum asking for 50 Cent from \"Many Men\", one\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nToo many relays for DJs to replay\nI do the reject while I eject your new singlay\nHot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave\nPiss on a demon with ice water\nAnd if I lose my voice then I'm probably calling out to all P.A\nSystems to assist in with the word I'm tryna spread\nLike county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie\nAnd that's off top like a toupee, I'm 2Pac\nComing back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album\nGet high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume\nI influence ghettos where it says caution\nAnd them bloggers get to sparking like L.A. females that's balling\nRound the time this happens often, the violence get the flare\nWe racing against life, the turtle or the hare?\nAnd nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build\nY'all work at Build-A-Bear soft as underhand pitching with skills\n\n[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]\nShit, and ain't no use in crying over spilt milk\nYou're dead and gone\nThe pall-bearers carry you and your family will carry on\nAnd on the real, this ain't a construction site but you know the drill\nWe lead the league in all aspects\nAnd we deserve more medals than a magnet\nPut you niggas in a hole like bad debt\nShooting three pointers with the globe, nothing but nets\n\n[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]\nNigga, nothing but the best\nEvery time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck\nI rhyme like a fucking TEC-9,\nAnd I 'Clown Posses' if they disrespect\nYou looking at a T-Rex snapping at 'em with Tourette's\nYeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers\nToo late, I grab the eight and start expiring rappers\nSome shit only BIG and Pac could rap after\nAnd if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes\nI am God\nM.C.R. squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/filepicker-images-rapgenius/0sfhqn8qSr0cTamFCJUd_ab-soul-dwtw-interview-3.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
