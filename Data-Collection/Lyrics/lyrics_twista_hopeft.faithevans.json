Hopeful and he'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but that's okay\n'Cause we hopeful!\n\n[VERSE 2 (Twista)]\nI wish that you could show some love\nInstead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)\nI wish I could teach the world to sing\nWatch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring\nI wish that we could hold hands\nListen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)\nWish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks\nBrand new shack and a lac' that's on dubs, And I\nWish we could keep achieving wonders\nSee the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)\nAnd I hope all the kids eat\nAnd don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)\nI hope them mothers stand strong\nYou can make it whether you with him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)\nWish I could give every celly some commissary\nAnd the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R. Kelly, And I\nWish that DOC could scream again\nAnd bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)\nThat one day they could speak again\nI wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN\nI wish we could never get the blues\nWish I could bring back the people that died at E2*, (I wish)\nI wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing\nHustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game\nLet's HOPE\n\n[Chorus (Faith Evans)]\nThough I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it\nLet it take you away\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but that's okay\nCause we hopeful!\n\n[VERSE 3 (Twista)]\nWish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic\nI try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it\nWe can make it always be optimistic\nIf you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it\nI pray for justice when we go to court\nWish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war\nWhy can't we kick it and just get em on\nAnd in the famous words of Mr. King \"Why can't we all just get along\"\nHope we can find a better way to shop and please, And I\nHope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I\nWish everybody would just stop and freeze\nAnd ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies\nYou can be wrong if it's you doubting\nWith the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains\nAnd only the heavenly father can ease the hurt\nJust let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!\nAnd let's HOPE\n\n[Chorus (Faith Evans) X2]\nThough I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today\nTake this music and use it\nLet it take you away,(let it take you away)\nAnd be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way\nI know it ain't easy but that's okay. (i know it ain't easy)\nCause we hopeful!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
