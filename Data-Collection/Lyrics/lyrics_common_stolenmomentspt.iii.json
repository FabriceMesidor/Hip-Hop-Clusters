Don't lie to me, man, just tell me why!\n-It's the money, alright?\n-Just tell me why!\n-It's the fucking money, alright??\n(Fight noises)\n\n[Outro: Q-Tip]\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit\nIt ain't sweet when you do that shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c13069157cf82b06434a58c5005ed904.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
