Girl you better cut the television on\nDon't wanna show yo' ass, best to get to gettin on\nHome, I'm waitin on ya if you want it\nI ain't gotta go for bad, I just go for my opponent\nI ain't lookin for no trouble, I ain't duckin none either\nSay a nigga jumpin ship I say so fuck 'em, I don't need 'em\nStill greet 'em, with the same smile like I used to\nGet wild if you choose to, I ain\u2019t finna' shush you\nEnd up head bust, bloody nose, loose tooth\nWhoop a nigga ass by himself or with a group too\nWho, fight back, ho it's like that\nWhere my knife at? Shawty I'll be right back\n\n[Hook: T.I.]\nFresh out the box I'mma mash out, ya hear me?\nThis year a hundred mil' I'mma cash out, ya hear me?\nToday a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?\nThe king pullin rank, big bank take little bank\nFresh up out the box I bet I mash out, ya hear me?\nThis year a hundred mil' I'mma cash out, ya hear me?\nToday a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?\nRollin through your hood, can you hear me now? Goooood\n\n[T.I.]\nWe gon' do it big like we did befo', fresh off a case\n+ASAP+, +Motivation+ ho, guess that's all it take\nThey got they ass with my poker face\nWait 'til they get a load of me like The Joker say (ha ha ha ha ha ha)\nA lot of talkin that bullshit'll pass but it ain't today\nGon' be a Code-10, man down, like Frankie say\nAy, at the lair where the players meet\nSo all squares kick rocks with your bare feet, bitches cherish me\nCame back, nigga raise up\nSafe to say them suckers wanna see me caged up - that chapter's over\nPass the mic and set the stage up, throw your A's up\nTell my P.O. I don't blaze up, Pee Wee fire the haze up\nThey praise us cause old heads recognize the G in him\nBlack card, +No Limit+ like P and them\nAin't nobody seein him - who fuckin with shawty\nWhen we pull up bitches yell out \"O.M.G.\" just like my daughter and them\n\n[Hook]\n\n[T.I.]\nI'm in a jet black Camaro with my eyes on the sparrow\nThey say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow\nI'm just waitin, niggas say it ain't the same and I get back\nSee ain't a damn thang change but my six pack\nHeh, you want wreck you can get that\nBut all the disrespectin shawty I ain't with that\nAnd partner I ain't fin' to chit-chat\nComin where a nigga had to break him off a piece like a Kit Kat\nTell them cats bless me to impress me\nBest leave or get wet like a jetski\nOverseas where you catch me\nAnd when they holla King nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley\nHard body lumped up, chest like a dumb truck\nKeep the sword on me shawty, this ain't what you want bruh\nI ain't gotta bust ya, if you close enough you get stuck\nLeave a nigga drippin like a sippy cup, pick 'em up\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f55abc725080eb05147e45ce3cd406a8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
