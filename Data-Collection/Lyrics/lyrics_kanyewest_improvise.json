I'm just getting by\nShe had a lil weed and we get a lil high\nAnd I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate\nTold me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe\nBoo back in 92' I was just like you\nPlease don't be confused by the ice and jewels\nI'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool\nLike any other kid that claim they hate school\nAnd think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel\n\n[Chorus](2X)\nWe ball 'til we fall\nHit the mall\nAfter we\nHit don't call\nWe fill your lives\nWith nothing but lies\nAnd I would like to\nApologize\n\nBut you can't stand right here\nAnd tell me everything is going to be alright\n'Cause until the day a real man stands up\nI'm going to have to improvise\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas it something I did wrong?\nYeah I know I'm wrong\nShe's at home alone and I'm always gone\nHate it when she mad but more when she passive\nNow she on the internet looking for classes\nOut of state though, man that hurt yo\nBut I got work though, and I'm at work yo\nAnd she don't call a lot\nAnd when she do she pouring out her heart\nYou never listen to me then the call drop hmm\nAnd I promised her everything\nTold her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring\nBut when I got my deal I was back in the ring\nFighting my urges, strip club splurges\nNever had money so I feel like a virgin\nAnd I'm trying to break the bank's cherry\nTrying to see can I afford Canaries\nWith a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?\nWhen from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week\nNo I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings\nHer mother picked up the phone\nLike she in school and she don't stay here no more\nI guess there's more good women than men percentage wise\nSo her chance of having a husband just minimize\nI guess that's why she says she ain't into guys\nAnd focus on school full-time to improvise\n\n[Chorus]\nNo no, you can't stand right here\nAnd tell me everything is gonna be alright\n'Cause until that real man stands up\nI'm going to have to improvise.
