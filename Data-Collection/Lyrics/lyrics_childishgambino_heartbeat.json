Wrong\nAskin' him if she wanna play games\nWith the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you\nI miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through\n69 is the only dinner for two\nI was wrong, but would you have listened to you?\nUh, you were crazy\nI got a heart, but the artichoke\nIs the only thing girls want when you in that smoke\nAnd light\n\n[Hook]\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\nI wanted you to know\nThat I am ready to go, heartbeat\nMy heartbeat\nI wanted you to know\nWhenever you are around, can't speak\nI can't speak\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo we're done? This the real shit?\nWe used to hold hands like field trips\nI'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick\nI read his post on your wall and I feel sick\nHe ain't cool, he ball and all that\nBut he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps\nYou couldn't wait to date\nI'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate\nI give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate\nYou know that I\u2019m the best when I\u2019m a-fake-tionate\nI'm the best that you had, face it\nJ and Keyshia are related: racist\nI give you money, then you burn me, then you made off\nShe ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off\nI know he wondering, \"What the fuck you hiding?\"\nThat we dated like raps about Bin Laden\nAyo, fuck this\nAre we dating? Are we fucking?\nAre we best friends? Are we something? In between that?\nI wish we never fucked, and I mean that\n\n(But not really, you say the nastiest shit in bed and it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 awesome)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78236fad04ed869070b0d50a1b6a02fa.600x602x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
