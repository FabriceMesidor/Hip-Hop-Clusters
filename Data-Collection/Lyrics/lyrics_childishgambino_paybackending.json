Dude 2 stands up\nThere's a small crash outside\n\nYelling\n\nVOICE: FREEZE!\n\nGUNSHOTS\n\nThe Boy and Dude 2 look at each other\n\nFATHER miraculously shows up in the doorway, larger than life, with an M-16 in one hand and a white tiger on a leash in the other. The tiger mauls Dude 2 to death\n\nFATHER (Rick Ross)\nBoy, what did I tell you 'bout fucking around with these cops?! Dope game ain't made for brothas like you\n\nTHE BOY\nFigured I can learn from the internet like everything else I've ever done. You were never there. It's all I had and all I ever needed. You think coming in here and saving my ass will make up for lost time? Fuck that. This all I got\n\nFATHER motions the boy over with outstretched arms. Looking for some sort of appreciation for saving his son's life. THE BOY smugly denies the motion of affection\n\nTHE BOY\nDon't play dad with me now! Too late for this fuckery. I'm packing my shit-\n\nBANG!\n\nFATHER kills his white tiger and now has his gun aimed at THE BOY\n\nFATHER\nYou unappreciative sack of shit. Should've left you in your mama's mouth, boy\n\nTHE BOY dives for Dude 2's pistol which is now lying covered in blood on the floor. FATHER fires, misses and realizes he must reload. THE BOY steadies his shot as FATHER now has a full clip. THE BOY's phone is prone on the floor, somehow filming the action\n\nBANG BANG!!\n\nTwo bodies drop. ZOOM shot of FATHER's bloody hand reaching for the phone. He shuts off the video and clutches his chest as THE BOY slowly pulls his bloody self up off the floor, pistol in hand\n\nSCREEN goes black\n\nTHE END", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a9c598da4e86fefcb845cbbe74706aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
