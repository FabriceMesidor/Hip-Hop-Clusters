You can't drink it, like you're 17\nI can show a million pair of eyes what they\u2019ve never seen\nAnd I can do this in whatever the weather brings\nPicasso couldn\u2019t paint a better scene\nColossal, now give me the mic and I rock like a fuckin fossil\nI'm mad at the track and I beat it like Hector Camacho\nWhat's poppin? What it do? What's happenin'? What's crackin'?\nQue pasa? The hospital, mi casa su casa\nBad, I'm rad\nAnd these niggas just squares like plaid\nAnd if they\u2019re cool, then I'm cold\nI gets money all day like the toll, bitch\n\n[Hook]\nI'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw\nI'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a BET soldier, an MTV gangsta\nI will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous\nExplain shit, I have made my way\nAnd you are just a stain, bitch, you will fade away\nAnd I only leave my house to paper-chase\nYep, off to the jungle, where I feel safe\nLike a home run in the bottom of the 9th inning\nAnd I'm fresh like I'm by Mennen\nI'm on the clock like 5 minutes\nTryin' to get passed the line of scrimmage\nYeah, and before I leave her thighs bendin'\nShe give me face first, like she done dived in it, haha\nAnd if she tall, I can climb in it\nI usually don't have a time limit\nAnd eatin pussy ain't a crime, is it? If so\nI should start working on my jail visits, you know\nI'm in the game, they just sell tickets\nMan, I got old bread, like stale biscuits\nYou feeling froggy, all you gotta do is yell 'Ribbit'\nTurn ya ass to a statue, like an exhibit\nNow let's get it!\nLet me at 'em, leave my cage open\nWith no pyro, I leave the stage smokin'\nYes, it's Weezy F, bitch\nThe best thing since breath, bitch! Suffocate!\n\n[Hook]\nI'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw\nI'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw, I'm raw\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit, yessir!\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt go; Uptown, Uptown, Operation Shutdown\nWake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds\nAnd you're not a gorilla, you're a dead monkey\n'Cause I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys\nWhat you said? Don't be afraid to say it twice\nAnd they say life is cheap until you pay the price\nIt's just like shaking dice, better hope you roll a winner\nAnd if you are a rat, you're just a cobra's dinner\nY'all ain't fuckin with me, you niggas under a G\nLike the light part of my feet\nAnd so what them niggas left me?\nWhen it get cold, I turns into Wayne Gretzky\nI do's it like it never been done\nSo you can suck my dick with a elephant's tongue\nBitch, it's Weezy Baby\nMotherfucker, I spit rabies\n\n[Hook]\nI'm raw, I'm raw\nI'm raw, I'm raw\nI'm raw, I'm raw\nI'm raw, I'm raw\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI got my brim low, all I can see is the flo'\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit\nI'm 'bout to murder this shit\n\n[Outro]\nI murdered that shit\nI murdered that shit\nRest In Peace to this song\nSee you at the crossroads\nThat's all I have to say, goodbye\n'Til yesterday", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f903dae2533e450c8d3cb233aa846020.745x745x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
