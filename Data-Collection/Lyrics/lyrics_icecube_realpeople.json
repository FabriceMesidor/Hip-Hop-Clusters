(Real people)\nIt's time to wake up and stand as one\nCallin' all the real people (Real people)\nYou still got our faith, nah, we ain't done\nTell me where the real people (Out there)\nThe real people (Out there)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nIt's a good day when it's me and O'Shea\nIt's like the times we cheered for O.J\nI say \"Mike,\" Cube say \"Kobe\"\nBut ain't no more beef, I put that on chief\nBlaow, a little homie dead in the streets\nIt's like the day they compared us to meat\nGlad Farrakan prepared us to meet\nNow me and bro bringing meals to the meek\nThink about my homie locked up like a Rasta\nDude in my ear askin' me about the Oscars\nI build with the gods to show improvement\nHard to complain, real people goin' through it\nI know the movement like I was Huey Newton\nCan't explain why youngins are shootin'\nThe revolution will not be on the 'Gram\nThe revolution is who I am, God damn\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm callin' all the real people (Real people)\nLet 'em know that the change gon' come\nTell me where the real people? (Real people)\nIt's time to wake up and stand as one\nCallin' all the real people (Real people)\nYou still got our faith, nah, we ain't done\nTell me where the real people (Out there)\nThe real people (Out there)\n\n[Outro]\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people-real people love this-love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people-real people love this-love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people-real people love this-love this\nI don't care what your color is\nAll my real people-real people love this-love this\nBe the change", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f45d7606b23a9adeb7bf1db11c4d9d9e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
