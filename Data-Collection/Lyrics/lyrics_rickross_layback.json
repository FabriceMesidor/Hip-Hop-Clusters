Just lay back, lay back\n\"La-la-la-la-laaa\"\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nGirl, I'm bright as a bezel, and you sexy as ever\nShorty what's on your brain, cause whatever is clever\nNumber one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar\nThis that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather\nRun a few errands, summers in Paris\nNever shoppin' in clearance, don't make me embarrased\nShe never a bird, but baby my parrot\nHer flavor superb, I pay her with carrots\nMy house is her home, I made her a palette\nMaybe bein' too modest, my shit more like a palace\nFollow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter\nShawty brace yourself, it's only gettin' better\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nIf you came to get the party started\nGirl, just say \"La-la-la-la-laaa\"\nI want to put my hands all over your body\nGirl, come this way \"Na-na-na-na-naaa\"\nWhat you gon' do-o-o\nIf I touch you, if I put my lips on you-ou-ou\nIf we took you back to the crib, just me and you-ou-ou\nAll night I want to play, just say \"Na-na-na-na-naaa\"\nJust take off your coat and just lay back\nAll you gotta do is just lay back\nWould you do this for me baby? Just lay back, lay back\n\"La-la-la-la-laaa\"\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nSee shawty laid back, so we laid up\nWhen I fade to black, we always made up\nThis shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of\nLook what I made brah, don't owe no favors\nHave 700s, first one to get it\nMy car's a virgin, first one to hit it\nHit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood\nStop by her momma house, that's if I'm feelin' good\nNow I need a fifth, time to hit the strip\nI'mma hit the club, I'mma buy the VIP\nWe spendin' money, I'm talkin' slick\nI hope she ride me, I'm talkin' stick\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nIf you came to get the party started\nGirl, just say \"La-la-la-la-laaa\"\nI want to put my hands all over your body\nGirl, come this way \"Na-na-na-na-naaa\"\nWhat you gon' do-o-o\nIf I touch you, if I put my lips on you-ou-ou\nIf we took you back to the crib, just me and you-ou-ou\nAll night I want to play, just say \"Na-na-na-na-naaa\"\nJust take off your coat and just lay back\nAll you gotta do is just lay back\nWould you do this for me baby? Just lay back, lay back\n\"La-la-la-la-laaa\"\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nI'm too tipsy to drive, she so sexy tonight\nMan ain't treatin' you right, his bank account empty inside\nShawty you need a plus, you need a rush\nNo need to lie, baby you need to fuck\n\n[Outro: Robin Thicke]\nYou came to get it started girl\nPut my hands all over you girl\nI touch you put my lips on you girl\nNa-na-na-na-naaa", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78f87f596103b6fbd0d1c2f8dad653c4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
