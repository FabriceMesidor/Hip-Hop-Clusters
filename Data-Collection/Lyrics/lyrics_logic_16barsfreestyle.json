Uhh\nWhen they come around\nI do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound\nFeel like my mind gone but I'm still here\nDon't fuck around cause they kill here\nThis music, it kill fear\nI use it when I need to hear\nBeen there, done that\nDrop this shit, they gonna run it back\nStupid shit, man I'm done with that\nFake rap, take it back\nMy chain heavy, got a lot of money, my bitch bad, have fun with that\nI've been there and don't want it back\nIf I see the bitch I might run it back cause I'm gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
