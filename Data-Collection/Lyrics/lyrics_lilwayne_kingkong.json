Where my money? Need to answer quick\nGotta get back up on my ransom shit, and put you (in the trunk)\nSo you lay on top of speakers\nHoles all in you like an old pair of sneakers\nBefore I do a day on the edge I will leap first\nBet you any money that I will land feet first\nMarried to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies\nRiding with Bigfoot, Harry and the Hendersons\nGodzilla, King Kong, and if I have to park\nI will open up my trunk and it will be Jurassic Park\n\n[Hook]\nI got that\nI'm talking 'bout that Blum-blum, blum-blum\nThat blum-blum, that blum-blum\nI'm talking 'bout that\nI'm talking 'bout choppers with drums\nChoppers with drums, choppers with drums\nDrought 3", "image": "https://images.genius.com/82588434bc5c5032b1e49dee6403c736.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
