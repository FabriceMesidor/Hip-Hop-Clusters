Probably not\n\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bba1920bee43a618432ce43748293ec6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
