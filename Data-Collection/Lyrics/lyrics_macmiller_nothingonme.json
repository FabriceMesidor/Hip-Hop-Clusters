Dream on(dream on)\nI'm so hard got more bars than a damn jail yard\nYou slow like them damn little snails are\nNow you in space with the star\nSo just chill for a second play the background\nHa Ha\nIts time to make room for the class clown...\n\n[Hook]\nI hear these kids and they trying to spit\nBut they sound so ass and I am the shit\nNo you got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy.not nothing on me)\nYou got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy..not nothing on me)\nThey tell their friends that they're gonna blow\nOnce they on the stage everybody go home\nNo you got nothing on me boy\nYou got nothing on me boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey.. look.. ah\nLabelled as a young man don't wanna get old\nLittle thing called hip hop stuck on my soul\nBumpin my shit coming up to a show\nWell it seems this youngin here looking like a pro\nNow I look fresh but I always had hoes\nWe just tell yea always had those\nGone so long now I'm coming back home\nSo many calls, gotta get another phone\nJust to deal with the day-to-day routine\nBut I'll always make a little time to dream\nCome with me you could learn a few things\nNo I'm good don't need a mood ring\nHey! Hip hop's little brother like Phonte\nLittle league no Danny Almonte\nBomb haze got me rising like Andre\nChilling, counting money with a couple of my hombres\n\n[Hook]\nI hear these kids and they trying to spit\nBut they sound so ass and I am the shit\nNo you got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy.not nothing on me)\nYou got nothing on me boy (not not not nothing on me boy..not nothing on me)\nThey tell their friends that they're gonna blow\nOnce they on the stage everybody go home\nNo you got nothing on me boy\nYou got nothing on me boy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
