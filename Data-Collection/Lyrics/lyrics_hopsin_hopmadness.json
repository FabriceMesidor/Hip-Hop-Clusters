Think before attacking me\nI know I'm quick to get outta line like I have to pee\nIt's obvious that I got your heart thumping\nI may look like a fucking idiot, but I promise I'm far from it\n\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheck me out\nI talk shit and whip beats, I'm a true MC\nOnly one who tells me what to do is me\nTake a close look at FV and what it grew to be\nHoppa, Dizzy, me and three Z has made the group complete\nMy shit is past basic, in my eyes I feel I have made it\nCame a long way from my mom and dad's basement\nWhen I do shows now the women strip me half naked\nMy motherfucking bad language got my ass famous\nNow labels thinking about signing me (yes)\nMTV has got they eye on me (yes)\nSkubbedy dubbedy wow, this is irony\nI still ain't giving a fuck\nSo if I hurt your feelings tell it to your diary\nNigga, I'm so beast, rhyming over cold beats\nFinally shining without the diamonds and gold teeth\nThe higher empire tryna bring fire in on me\nSo I keep my guards up, when I'm tired I don't sleep\n\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know there's whole lot of niggas who wonder why I keep dissin'\nI ain't trippin', just listen, I'm on a discrete mission\nRappers speaking on drugs, money and deceive women for a check\nWhile they boss grillin', sittin' in their seat spinnin'\nThat's like the foulest crime\nSomewhere down the line I was bound to rise\nTo make a difference, and now it's time\nI know you rappers is about a dime\nBut it\u2019s hard for me to live when you corrupting minds I\u2019m surrounded by\nI ain't the nigga you go outshine\nTruth is, you only go in when I'm coming outside\nFuck your road, turning down mine\nWhen you greet me get on your knees and open your mouth wide\nFor the record I ain't the type to share\nIf you a rapper tainting my image, then war is what I might declare\nJust cause I'm buzzing off the white contacts\nDon't mean you should take your ass to Hot Topic to buy a pair\n\n[Hook]\nA year ago I wasn't all that\nNow all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack\nAm I your best friend? What? Heck no\nYou can be a fan of all of my songs, nigga but, just don't\nRide my dick, no, don't ride my dick\nYes, don't ride my dick, no, don't ride my dick\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/94da7b3a0112e194ef20bf540274b5e6.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
