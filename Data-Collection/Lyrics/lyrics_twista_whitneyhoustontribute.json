Somebody told me Whitney Houston died\nCan't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes\nShe was gettin' better, now it's really just blew aside\nI still ain't got over Don Cornelius' suicide\nSo, where do I start it? Dearly departed\nOne of Heaven's angels for sure, who was really an artist\nLovin' the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical\nAin't nobody like you, nobody before you and nobody after you\nCould ever come near it, not here in the flesh but you with us in spirit\nSo sad to hear it, I'm choking up while I come up with these lyrics\nAnd though she blessed the Earth and it's time to let Heaven prosper\nI still wish somebody was there to protect her, (Who?) Kevin Costner\n(Who?) Clive Davis, (Who?) Bobby Brown\nHer mama and her daughter, Whitney is where God be now\nSuch a short time, don't want it to be this way\nBut if she was here, she would probably say:\n\n\"If I should stay, I would only be in your way\"\n\nIf you wanna say rest in peace to Whitney Houston\nI had Traxter leave 16 bars open on this song..\nSo that you could do so with me\nSo get your verses ready, hop on this track with me\nPay a tribute to the late Whitney Houston", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
