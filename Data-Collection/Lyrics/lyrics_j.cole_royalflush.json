Nothing\nThey talking gangsta without no data, they fronting\nJackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting\nI wish a nigga would say something\nI'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back\nPiggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat\nAnd I'mma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at\nAnd I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques\nShoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya\n\n[Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick\nThey say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit\nAnd I tote my horns. A star when I was born\nMy name ain't James, my word is bond\nYea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99\nDamn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past\nYou're listening to the future\nThe flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser\nThen they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool\nI said I got a girl, she told me, \"Me too! \"\nSo that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood\nBaby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it\n\n[Break]\n\nYea and this is only \"The Warm Up\" yea", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/bbedb619df51d7c751c886dc70dfc60c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
