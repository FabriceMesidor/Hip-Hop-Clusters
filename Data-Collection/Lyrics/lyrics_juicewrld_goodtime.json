Bro passed out laying next to a bad broad\nSlept and had a good time, I must've took her for some reason can't remember my night\nRich in my pockets with the [?]\nHalf a Percocet, 200 dollars, and a weed pipe\nThat's when somebody hit my phoneline\n[?]\nI don't know what happened, but I wanna know\nI guess we gotta do it all over again tonight\n\n(Chorus)\nI hop in the car with my friends and play my song\nI hope the memories we make last all life long\nI hop in the car with my friends and play my song song\nAin't no telling where we'll end up\n\n(Verse 2)\n\nHere we go again, woke up in a bed\nBut it wasn't my bed, whose is this?\nVision kinda blurry I can't see shit\nFast around my body I see two tattooed hicks\nLast night more blank than the night before\nAt least I made it to a bed last time I woke up on the floor\nAll I could remember is a bitch screaming \"more, more, more\"\nVideos on my phone we were in a high-speed chase in a white rouge\nLooks like we threw them hands too, here's a clue, neck was bruised, and somebody else's blood on my elbows\nLately I've been blacking out, drugs getting too strong, buying outta pills from the plug money too long\nI get high to let it go and find out where I belong, probably by my Vlone\nParty with my demons\n\n(Chorus)\nI hop in the car with my friends and play my song\nI hope the memories we make last all life long\nI hop in the car with my friends and play my song song\nAin't no telling where we'll end up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
