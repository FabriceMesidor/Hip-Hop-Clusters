So I'm honored to be here today\nThe world is ours, we should celebrate in every way\nSpread the knowledge to the youth and tell them when we lay\nSix feet, I'm six feet\nStanding on my own two, and my own shoulders\nIt's that deep, shifting to max p's, will I put my ego right\nInto the back seat, flowing out my veins\nRunning tracks like an athlete it's insane\nApex rap-thletics, leave 'em gassed off the aesthetics, yeah\n\nOutro/[Hook]:\nYea, yo, yo, The Badmon, Young G\nG, yea, Young G, yea and\nI know you see me (I woke early on my born day)\nIm 20, it's a blessing, I woke up early on my born day\nI'm 20, it's a blessing, yo, yo, The Badmon, Young G\nI woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing\nYea, yea, I woke up early on my born day, yea, yea, yo\nBadmon, Young G, Rest In Peace to Cap Steez, yea\nR.I.P to Junior B, yea, yea, yo, yo, yo, The Badmon, Young G\nRest In Peace to Cap Steez, yea, R.I.P Junior B, yea", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e57ba626ad84dbd4f49df090fb62d683.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
