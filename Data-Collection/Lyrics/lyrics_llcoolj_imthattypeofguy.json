Thank you, sweetheart\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early\nTakes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast\nYou're the type of guy eatin' a TV dinner\nTalkin 'bout... \"Goddamn it, I'ma kill her\"\nI'm the type of guy to make her say, \"Why you illin', B?\"\nYou're the type of guy to say, \"My lower back is killin' me\"\nCatch my drift?\nYou're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English\nI'm the type of guy to cold pour 'n pamper\nYou're the type of guy to say, \"What you talkin' 'bout?\"\nI'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy\nYou know what I mean?\nCheck it out...\n\n[Verse 4]\nT-y-p-e g-u-y\nI'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye\nLike a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted\nBut when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it\nCause you're the type of guy that don't know the time\nSwearin' up and down, \"That girl's all mine\"\nI'm the type of guy to let you keep believin' it\nGo 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm that type of guy\nI'm that type of guy, know what I mean\nI'm that type of guy\n\"So ridiculous!\"\n\n[Outro]\nSo funny\nI don't know\nCome on now\nYeah\nLike real cool, you know what I mean?\nI like just going to your front door ringin' the bell\nAnd just like\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nHA HA HA HA HA HA\nHA HA HA HA HA HA!!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2b27616bb60a3dae2d404e821cd5b36.600x593x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
