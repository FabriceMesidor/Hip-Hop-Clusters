Nobody fuckin' with me\nI murder rappers everyday, 'til police come and get me\nAnd Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio\nAin't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas\nEmotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas\nCrying 'bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas\nTrying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas\nI'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining\nIf this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising\nI'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record\nBut I mean it, kept my blessings\nWe was dreaming, now we close enough to see it\n\n[Hook: Justus]\nI don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know\nOne thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)\nIs one day I'ma have everything\nIt was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)\n\n[Outro: Justus & King Mez]\nListen, I've been tryna get it all\nI'm just in this bitch, I'ma show 'em how to get involved\nYeah I want everything, yeah I want everything\nTalk about it, hol' up, if you really 'bout it\nTell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it, what?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19804ba7a9b6ceb36d0158950514927a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
