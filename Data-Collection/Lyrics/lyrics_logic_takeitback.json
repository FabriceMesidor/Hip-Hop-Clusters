No, no\nYes, I got to gift to gab fo sho\nBut will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?\nMasta deep down inside of me\nThe plantation deep down inside of me\nEverybody fuck like sodomy\n'Cause one or the other what it gotta be\nTell me why my momma gotta lie to me\nUnity for everyone that lied to me\nPeace on Earth what I try to be\nI just wanna spread the message of equality\nAnd yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho\nWill I have to get the gat? No, no\nYes, I got to gift to gab fo sho\nBut will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?\n\n[Chorus]\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black man\nLong ago before the white man\nCould paint the black man with a gun in his hand\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first white man\nAt the very moment when they looked around and said\n\"Fuck it, I\u2019ma steal this land\"\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way way back to the first black man\nLong ago before the white man\nCould paint the black man with a gun in his hand\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way way back to the first white man\nAt the very moment when they looked around and said\n\"Fuck it, I\u2019ma steal this land\"\n\n[Outro]\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to about 1990\nShady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland\n7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born\nTo a black father and a white mother\nFather that wasn\u2019t there\nAddicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs\nSame as his mom\n(Way, way back)\nSo I\u2019m gonna tell you about that, right?\nAnd I\u2019m gonna tell you about how\nAll this young boy ever wanted was happiness\nAll he ever wanted was positivity\nAll he ever wanted to do was entertain\nAnd this boy went through hell\nYou gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy\n'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have\nAll these black babies with black men but you racist\nLike bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger\nThe kids at school callin' him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can\u2019t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the whole world said\nWhat they said?\nSaid you wouldn\u2019t be shit!\nYou ain\u2019t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'\nNothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing\nAnd I, and he, he said fuck that, I\u2019ma persevere\nAnd that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this child growing up\nAnd seeing the craziest shit\nBeing a part of the craziest shit\nRunning around with the wrong people\nRunning around with guns and knives\nAnd fighting and stealing and, and all this\nBecause he didn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t know!\nBut he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn\u2019t right\nAnd he knew that he needed to get away from it\nNow I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old\nThis child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself\nTwo jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings\nAnd then he would then come home\nTo about eight or nine hours of sleep\nBut spend four, five, six hours of that\nWorking on music, persevering\nGrabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror\nAnd pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people\nJust chanting his name\nHoping that it would happen\nBut the, but the, but the world said no!\nMothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no\nYa nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka\nNo-no!\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nAnd he said fuck that\nHe said peace, love, and positivity\nHe said equality for all man\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah\nNow I want you to also imagine\nPeople telling him that he did not live this life\n\u201cYou just a white boy\nYou ain\u2019t never experienced that shit\nYou from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there\nOh no, no, we know, we weren\u2019t there\nWe didn\u2019t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household\nWe didn\u2019t live with the narcotics and violence in your household\nWe just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside\nOutside, outside, outside, outside\nAnd since you white, you gotta have money, right?\u201d\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black man)\nAnd this young man persevered in spite\nOf what people told him he was, wasn\u2019t, and would never be\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black)\nAnd that man is here today, proud\nA lover of all human beings\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah\nAnd he\u2019s here to say:\nEven though we\u2019re all born and created equal\nWe are not treated equally\nThere\u2019s extremists on every side\nAnd you should just do your best to live life\nAnd let other people believe whatever they wanna believe\nAs long as they\u2019re not hurtin' anybody\nYou can believe they\u2019re going to hell\nYou can believe it\u2019s not right\nYou can believe you\u2019re superior, fine\nJust stop killing each other", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a2c364a06d2844fd9e294ee0ea798ff.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist":
