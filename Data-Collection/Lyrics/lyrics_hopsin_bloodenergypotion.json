(blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\n\n[Verse 3]\nBeat niggas till they have concussions (woah)\nRape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)\nAnd if you down with the mass destruction (what)\nToast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)\nPray to God for a night to start\nI'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts\nBeing shot with darts till it stops your heart\nAnd chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart\nAnd pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate\nEnding that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed\nYou're gonna suffer the consequences\nYou can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)\nPretty clear that my brain's not there\nI be looking for it when I shave my hair\nBlack is the color that I paint my lair\nAnd the way I break niggas everyday is not fair\nIt's all because of the rage I bare\nSee I'm down for whatever, just say \"I dare\"\nMy nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou don't like me? Tune it out\nI'm livin' life on the foolish route\nWhen I hit the kitchen, I butcher niggas until they drain slowly, but only when the moon is out\nI get this way when my mood is down\nSome even think that I'm rude and foul\nOut of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)\nBack in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck\nLeavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground\nWhen they came round, yell \"fuck\" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)\nThe sight of blood is so marvellous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut\nHit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up\nAnd then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter\nMakin' you scream makes me a happier rapper\nYou don't want trouble then your ass better back up\nFast little bastard (blood)\nI was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters\nLook over your shoulder when I'm in the area\nYou might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)\n\n[Hook]\nNow see, I got a strange urge\nAnd I feel like creepin' up on a stranger\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nI want your blood\nBlood, blood, blood, blood\nGive me your blood", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
