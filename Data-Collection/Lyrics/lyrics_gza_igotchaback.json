Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected\nMy lifestyle was so far from well\nCould've wrote a book with a title \"Age 12 and Going Through Hell\"\nThen I realized the plan\nI'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man\nSo I don't only watch my back, I watch my front\nCause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts\nBack on the Ave of Livonia and Bristol with a pistol\nSticking up Pamela and Crystal\nYou know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest\nKid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes\nWhat is the meaning of CRIME (what?)\nIs it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?\nLittle shorties take walks to the schoolyard\nTrying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard\nThen as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!\nShots ring off and now one of them lay down\nIt's so hard to escape the gunfire\nI wish I could rule it out like an umpire\nBut it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist\nOnly the players change, so\n\n[Hook: GZA and RZA]\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back so you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front, that be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back but you best to watch your front\nIt's the niggas who front, that be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts\nI gotcha back, but you best to watch your front\nCause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)\n\n[Outro: (LP version only)]\nYour, tech, nique, is, mag-ni-ficent\nWhen cut across the neck\nA sound like wailing winter winds is heard, they say\nI'd always hoped to cut someone like that someday\nTo hear that sound\nBut to have it happen to my own neck is... ridiculous\n*man gasps for air*", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/7065891d83418acd6960323d6c47e732.494x468x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
