Well that's another story black\n\n'Cause I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One\nI'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One\nI'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One\nYou know I'm the Real one, yes the Phuncky Feel One\n\nStandin on the corner, close to the real estate\nClones they really pull stickin brothers try to imitate\nMeaning when they simulate, but they can't stimulate\nLike a faded joint, stiff from the breath I take\n\nMake me act loco, they switchin' up my vocal\nOut to catch you so-called, MC's with a roll call\nThen you gotta close your eyes, you can't stand the sunlight\nThere is just one light, the Tribe's buckin' heads tonight\n\nBuck buck buck ya head! Sorry that red is dead\nDeader than a door nail, someone cold made his bed\nDidn't just break out, the sucker got cracked out\nHit the pipe and blacked out, with the shit from back down\nSo much more integrity, greatest deal I hook up\nWas a funky looker, but that's another story black\n\n'Cause we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones\nWe're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones\nWe're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones\nYou know we're the Real ones, yes the Phuncky Feel Ones", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2615919eb0bcef9d55421080ab3b10b1.860x860x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
