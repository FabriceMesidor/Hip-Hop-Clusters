I don't believe this guy!\"\nWhat what you gonna do?\nMay I diss her?  Yes you may\nThat girl's a slut, with a hole in her butt\nWho used to be a meaty-bone puppy child little mutt\nCame to my house smellin like trout\nI said, \"Doggie doggie doggie, get out!!\"\nShe did my dick, I mean she bit bad vicious\nDirt Megirt, deep dark and delicious\nShe's a doo-doo BUH\nAlcoholic NUH\nAnd her ass is tighter\nThan a pair of vice GRIPS\nSpeaking of a TUH\nI won't kiss, because they don't give milk\nThem shit, kick, see uh\nLet me tell you about the rash from the neck\nIt's enough to put the ring around the collar in check\nShe's nothin but a BUH\nOtherknown as a WUH\nWith an irritating ITCH\nFrom trying to SWITCH\nStrung out ass, foggin up glass\nTell all the NUH that the pussy first class\nSmoke a bag of hash with the money she stash\nBut she had to play the corner just to make that cash\nPulled down her panties and scratched that rash\nThen rubbed it with that a pimp had slashed\nTryied to get saved at the Tabernacle Prayer\nBut the only thing holy was her shitty underwear\nI will change a style, always I will fix\nBut you can not teach an old bag...\n\nOutro:\n\nYo I ain't got to say no more Son\nYo word to God man\nOnly thing I'm saying man, is use a Trojan\nKnowhatI'Msayin?  Fore real man\nCause it's on man\nYouknowhatI'msayin?
