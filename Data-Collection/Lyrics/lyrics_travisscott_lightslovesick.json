Oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nDinner time, I'm dining out with a porn star\nShe remind me of home, L.A., our second home\nSee see we met at Leon, plenty empty bottles of Lonestar\nConversation was long, how she landed from Rome\nYeah, she did\nLater on that night I got her back to the crib\nKicked off My Will&Rich and got her down to her skin\nAfter all she got a little taste test of my kids\nYou know what, we used to dream about this\nA couple models and cribs, way fresher than movies\nShould of know it was fake, I could tell by the boobies\nTreated life like a safe, load it up and then blew me\nYeah, she did\nHead so good, it ain't even cost me\nWoke up, she gone, look what I lost\nSheepskin' and that (?)\n\n[Hook]\nDo you realize?\nWe all want these flashing light, oh\nSo when you close your eyes\nDo you picture us havin' a hell of a night?
