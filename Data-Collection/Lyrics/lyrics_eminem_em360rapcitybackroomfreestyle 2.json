what it is\nRap City presents Em360\nSlaughterhouse, Eminem, Big Tigg, Just Blaze!\nOn the 1s and 2s, oh-oh\n\n[Intro: Eminem]\nYo Tigg, get in the not booth\nAnd spit the truth, to the young youth\n\n[Verse 1: Big Trigger]\nAight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards\nBut this Hip Hop, so don't leave home without your bars\nAnd for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad\nCause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had\nIt's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth\nAnd ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth\nYes indeed original, beats the replacement cause\nThe back room will never be what the basement was\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Budden]\nI'm the realest mo'fucker that I know\nWasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow\nI do it for the love I don't do it for the dough\nBut I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes\nWhat's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for\nAnd them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more\nThese fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe\nI grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe\nWant to see me lose every battle of depression\nNo matter what it do to me, no matter my regression\nThey want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start\nWant to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart\nI'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while\nSendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks\nWas so high I lost track of my ways\nThen I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age\nThe way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase\nHow you trife when I gave you life\nYou was lacking in wage\nYou don't want say hi or speak to me\nBet you makin 200 dollars by weekly\nTry to help the world out, bring some reparation\nAnd forget being humble in a state of desperation\nAin't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation\nAnd for me to deal with it I might need some meditation\nI love you but its best we stay apart, segregation\nAnd to cope with the feeling I might need some medication\nTrust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe\nIt would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know\n\n[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]\nIts Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat\nSymbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee\nBest rapper alive and you know me\nThe most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D\nI take mines at lead point\nAt the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint\nHip hop is alive, but the rhymes died\nOnly fear I have is \"world star\" being yelled from my blind side\nDon't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight\nBut these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste\nI'm outlining everybody in chalk white\nThe off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse\nThis ain't blueprint, your idolizing\nYou tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license\nThat's plain stupid, your boy's a star\nSitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar\nIt's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car\nAnd now it's back and forth\nThe black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore\nAnd Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds\nWe not a group, we more like a circular firing squad\nThis not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop\nWe killed the cypher two times already\nWhat you gon' give us an award\nBut we won't stop for shutting down the internet\nNow tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet\n\n[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]\nWhen we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters\nBest spit, make any set trip, yeah its the gang members\nWaving that shady flag, navy jag\nMatching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag\nI'm in a crazy kind of place\nI got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face\nSo chill, I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist\nThat'll leave kids on your baby mommas face, for real\nThe flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules\nYour cap just started snapping\nMy starter caps was snapping\nWhen cross color was cracking\nAnd my cane was half full\nWith the half moon park, hope you rap dudes smart\nDon't piss me off like the bathroom mop\nYou don't want it with me\nIf I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free\nSo save your jabs its way better\nIf I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather\nYeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how niggas shook turned notebook\nBroke cook, I'm so dope look\nBring the beat back with no hook just bars\nJust a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras\nMove g-strings like guitars, that's nothing, that's something light\nLike Riesling at the bar\nY-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say\nThis like NWO vs NWA, y'all like the rockers versus the ROC\nFull of nothing but Jays\nCheck the rocks its nothing fugaz'\nBut don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days\nMake it horny when we out, Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house\n\n[Verse 5: Crooked I]\nSlaughter season, y'all the reason\nReal dudes I'm bringing some more in\nLike a Polynesian\nSick with the llama squeezing\nBullets flew and the chopper sneezing\nGot your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne\nYou was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing\nThey set you deep in your coffin sleeping\nI'm gone off the deep end, I'm a wolf, this industry my sheep skin\nI'm out here hunting with my ink pen\nI'm living like a kingpin\nDoing it for my g's in the pen\nDreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin\nYou rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers\nI'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters\nYou looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur\nYou got the Wright brothers\nNo bright jeans, no bright colors\nI'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted\nIslamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen\nI backed you in a dodge a minute\nLike MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace\nI'm looking at your videos, look like your watching tennis\nBrothers dressed like Maria Sharapova wearing yoga pants\nMeanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens\nI guess that era's over man, hold on\nI'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'\nI give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles\nBefore me you didn't have em'\nYou rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam\nStab em in the abdomen when its crunch time\nI truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a movie script\nToo many punchlines\nFamily I'm amongst mine\nI keep the peace like a monks mind\n.357 fade your favorite barber\nLeave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara\nDon't stop what we doing\nWhen you see L.A. your team will be ruined\nThis game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, ooh kill em'\n\n[Introduction: Big Trigger]\nLadies and gentlemen\nNow introducing the man, the myth, the legend\nMister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 6: Eminem]\nAyo can we cut this beat off\nI might need to do this acapella, yo\nRole model?\nI'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products\nIf she don't swallow, and tie her to the bumper, hit the throttle\nWhile I'm tryna hit the pot holes, I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds\nAny ho'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle\nI don't cuddle, I don't coddle\nOnly motto that I follows is everything I drive, whether it's a  Navajo or a Tahoe\nIt's got a ho in it\nNah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco\nYou looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto\nI got a rusty Hondo with some bondo\nAnd a box of condoms you little blond ho\nFuck me? Fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono\nAnd I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu\nI'm intolerable, too volatile, screw it\nI don't got too make the honor roll to be on a roll\nI don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though\nSo knock it off, all these knock-off-me's,\nThe last thing the world needs is another me\nBut if you think this is part 2 to Recovery\nOr to \"Love the Way You Lie\" part twelve\nOr something heart felt, you 'bout to make a discovery\nLike you found Christopher Columbus' compass\nAin't dumbing shit down for you dumb motherfuckers, so suck it\nI took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach\nThat punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it\nChump it was nothing\nNow watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn\nOnce I think of something to trump it\nAnd I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off\nLike the trunk of an elephant; the triumphant\nReturn of the ether spitting retard, reborn\nBut chances of you having another re-birth, slim to none\nLike a skinny Mother Teresa, give a fuck if it's Easter, so kiss my keister\n'Cause that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0fd2397265910e9f72dcf0c68b690ea7.304x172x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
