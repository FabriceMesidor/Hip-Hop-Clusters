Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft\n\n[Part 1: \"Backseat Freestyle\" Remix]\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been killing microphones, killing microphones\nI've been killing microphones, killing microphones\nNigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones\nKilling microphones, killing microphones\n\n[Verse 1]\nI been like the zone\nWhen you talk to me minimize your tone\nTake some of that bass out your voice\nDon't go and put your Energizer on\nWith this beat I'm going all the way\nI don't mean to the end of night, come on\nI mean I'mma take it to the grave, untilI end your life it's on\nI'm talking about cracker-jacking these niggas\n'Til their whole enterprise is gone\nI'm talking about clapping at these niggas\nWith some shit that's gonna feminize you strong\nI'm talking about tenderize the bone\nI ain't talking about weird science though\nWhen I say that my ceiling is probably gone\nI'm talking about villainizing your home\nNigga, I been in like the zone\nI'm looking like Rambo in this bitch\nBut nigga, I ain't feeling like Stallone\nFeel more like I'm in a heist alone\nLook, I don't like to aim my shit at any artist\nWhen I'm writing I'm just generalizing\nHow am I gon' take a shot at something\nI can't even fucking identify with?\nI'm feeling like the long days away from feeling my Patr\u00f3n\nUsed to have the coldest bitches waiting for me\nChilling by the phone\nUsed to do donuts on the grass\nNow I'm just feeling like a drone\n'Cause even though I'm sitting high somewhere\nI'm still spinning by your home, bitch\n\n[Part 2: \"Mask Off\" Remix]\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been killing microphones, bitch, killing microphones, bitch\nI've been killing microphones, killing microphones\nNigga, I've been killing microphones, killing microphones\nKilling microphones, killing microphones\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis a new life, who this?
