Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker\nIt's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester\nThe base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!), I'm going like fuschia\nAll I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa\nIf a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya\nAnd that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real\nKitchen counter tapping then undercover skills\nYour beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em\nStretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room\nBeat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em\nThen repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up\nBut then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em\nBeats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em\nAnd if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina\nTo her I would have ran, but now she like Pam\nShe still want the flow but now I'm like damn\nWhisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit\nScramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit\nBeats get weaker the deeper that I get\nDamn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip\nWhen the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip\nSo I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship\nAnd noble or sober or my song nobler\nEating with our hands and the waiter is a fan\nShout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands\nTailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan\nSky dropped six on the blazer\nDrop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya\nFree Rico, before he do his bid\nGot a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is\nBlack dragon slayer they ain't knowing what he did\nWant everybody in Bull city eating like a pig, lets do it!\nDurk, Mouse, Paris, Keef, Boolu, Dub, Pharris\nDrama, Common, Flict, Ye, Chance, Illinois, Lupe", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
