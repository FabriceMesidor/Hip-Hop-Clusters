I dapped him up and got to sliding\nHe crinkled it up, walked off then put it in his pocket\nOff to the strip club with some drinks and some orders\nHe pull that hundred out his pocket, uncrinkled the corners\nStageside, watching this one bitch shaking and twirling\nBusted it open all exotic and maybe she's foreign\nShe making eye contact, she got on eye contacts\nShe sees that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that\nShe's thinking \"I want that\", he takes a sip from his glass\nShe bend over, he slaps her ass and puts some ones in her crack\nHe whispered in her ear \"How long are you here? Tell me you single\nOh, you got a man? Fuck, I don't care, tell him I'm queer\nSave my name as Susan in your contacts, hm\nAnd fuck your relationship, I ain't worried about that, heheh\nCan I use that red marker, sir?\nLet me write my number on this hundred for you\nMake sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can't do nothing for you\n(508)-507-2209\"\nShe got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door\nCounting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor\nI don't think she like how this shit make her feel\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills\nFor real, she wanna get high now, uhh\nGrab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh\nFew grams of coke on the table, that's the right now, uhh\nShe rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like\nThat's what she call Heaven's door\nThat's what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs\nShe throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store\nShe needed blunts for the gas, she needed gas for the Ford\nShe needed eggs and some dill, she needed cheese and some milk\nShe needed change\n\n[Interlude]\n\"What what number is that?\nI said what number is that on the bill, what is that?\nYes, in red, it's like a phone number\nWhat is this? Never mind\"\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Aye aye, don't you make one mothafucking move\nEmpty that register, I know you don't need my help\nHurry the fuck up, look, don't make me repeat myself\nGimme the cash, follow instructions, don't be fucking moving\nCause I'd hate to kill you over something stupid\nNow hand me the bread and place your hands on top of your head\nTake my tough advice\nTurn around and count to a hundred if you love your life\"\n\n[Chorus]\nNow keep it a 100\nUhh, keep it a 100\nYeah, keep it a 100\nOne hundred\nKeep it a 100\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit\nMoney's the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit\nHe put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too\nHope that it'll take away your sins, maybe someday soon\nBut anyway, they covered the plate and just continued praying\nAfter church, the pastor opened it up and started saying\n\"Lord forgive me but I need this, I've been really static\"\nAnd he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it\nHeld it up to see if it's real or fake\nThen looked around to make sure nobody was looking, and then he took it, damn\nOff to the streets with the Lord, off to go find him a whore\nA hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course\nHe see some bitch on the corner, he told her hop in the car\nAnd then she opened the door\n\"Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up, I ain't tryna get caught up\"\nThen continued driving and stuff, looking for a spot in the cut\n\"How much for head?\"\n(A 100)\n\"Now how much for sex?\"\n(A 100)\n\"Damn, a 100?\"\n(Come on, that's not a lot)\n\"Fuck\"\n(Why you playing?)\n\"Nah, I'm just saying, that's a lot bitch, like gotta calm down, damn\"\nNow she making eye contact, she got on eye contacts\nShe see that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that\nShe's thinking \"I want that\", he pulls his dick out his pants\n\"Ooh God is good\"\nTransaction complete, and she went back to the streets\nBack to the cash at the leash, she back to get back on her knees\nAnd she don't like how this shit make her feel\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills\nFor real, she wanna retire soon, she swear to God (*smack*)\nShe looked up and seen the hand of God, oh my God...\nForgot she had a pimp\nThat nigga been looking for her ass for days\nTook every single dollar and left her eye black and gray\nHe be on the corner jamming, getting drunk that-a-way\n7-Eleven gambling, throwing all his cash away, yup\nSome say that money rule the world, I know you heard that shit\nMoney the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit\nYeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game\nHe said \"I should've just bet that shit on tonight's game, whatever nigga, nice game\"\nThe homie who won it walked off with the hundred\nThen opened up his wallet, stuck it inside and then put it in his pocket\nStarted stomping and running\nFeeling so good, started hopping and jumping, money flopping and rumbling\nHis eyes is as big as his smile, no stopping him from the prow\nHe's jogging, skipping around, 'til his wallet fell on the ground\nA hundred sticking halfway out, in the back of a halfway house\nFor like three weeks so don't even ask me how, check it\nA homeless man walks by, sees a wallet, opens his eyes\nAnd then grabs it, opens to check what's inside and to his surprise\nIt's money, a couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing\nA number written in red, if he had a phone he would call\nBut he doesn't, so he says \"Fuck it, it's mine\nAnd I'm really hungry and thirsty, I want some beer, a beef jerky\nMaybe some ten percent juice, hm\nAnd if the store's open, I need some cigarettes too\", true\nHe walked into the same store on the block\nJust so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed\nWhat a coincidence, that shit is just as weird as I thought\nThe clerk rang him out and said, \"That'll be 18.25\"\nAnd then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top\nThen everything stopped\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace\n\n[Brief Message]\nMr. Lucas, Officer Michael Bradley with the police department\nTrying to get a hold of you now, this is the third time calling\nI need to speak to you with regards to some serious charges\nYou need to get back to me as soon as possible\nOr we'll be showing up at your door\nWith about 10 officers and some handcuffs\nChoice is yours", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15c4c3c9fa26958e4841c4e8276492ed.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
