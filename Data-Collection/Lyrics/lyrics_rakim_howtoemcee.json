I'mma show you\nYou gotta put your life in them lines\nMake the deaf hear, give sight to the blind\nMake your flow tighter, brightest designs\nSo if the mic is your grind then biting's a crime\nEspecially if a ghostwriter's writin your rhymes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a5928958bdda95a9493e76a22eeb4be.588x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
