I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo be a high rolla, you need a pistola\nAnd about a half a key of some Coca Cola\nNow that I got older, I got a little colder\nAnd I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder\nMan dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney\nOr Bogey for Snoop Doggy\nAin't no follower, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so original\nI'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger\nBut that's the little homie, and I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone\nSpittin three words up in lightning\nAs long as I'm bouncin with this I know you likin this\nFo' sho tho, you can't take my photo\nI'm layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do\nGet pushed around downtown in the back of a car\nThe Double R from the dirt to the stars\n\n[Chorus]\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell in verse three, the worst see?\nAfter part two, know when I start the clock there be a heart, too\nAnd just the two of us, gonna show you how we do\nI thought you knew we bust\nI demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust\nNo dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luther\nCause ya see ain't no loser\nThat can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper\nI refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics\nI choose to mash like Land Cruisers\nYou know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee\nThey can't get with the D-O double G\nYou know MC slash master of ceremonies\nRunnin thangs, pullin strings call me Snoop Pesci\nLesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me\nDon't wanna test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?\n\n[Chorus]\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I (may... I), may I funk with you?\nMay I?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7d84865e8d21f7778aa93228a899a2c.599x623x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
