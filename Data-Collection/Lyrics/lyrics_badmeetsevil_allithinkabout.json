Or did you jump?\nOr did you just become bored with this?\nYou\u2019re slipping into a funk, I just become morbid\nAnd more self-absorbed in my own world, everyone orbits\nPen at the table, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be able to stop\nTold you from the gate\nOne thought it generally takes and I\u2019m off to the races\nWait, mentally stable, hold your fuckin' horses\nThere\u2019s nothin' more disgustin' an animal\nI just got done snortin' the fuckin' bathroom soap\nAnd the tannin' lotion\nTo unwarp this mind you gon' need some sort of an antidote\nThere\u2019s not a pill for bananas though\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, you got delusions of grandeur though\nActin' like you\u2019re Michelangelo with a fuckin' cordless\nBitch, I'm Shredder, so you better crawl back in your shell\nOr run 'fore you get injured\nA fuckin' Ninja Turtle wouldn\u2019t come toward us\nTwo joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is\n'Cause we\u2019d smoke you on any joint\nBad and Evil's back, bitch\nYou might experience some shortness of breath\nAs you sit with your lungs punctured\nHear their motherfuckin' tears come pourin'\nIf I tell you once more, then you\u2019re done for\nYou\u2019re going to have to learn\nHow to fuckin' hear from a ruptured eardrum\nForrest, am I clear? You Gump, you\u2019re as dumb as a stump\nTo think we'd come with a trunk shortage\nB-b-b-b-bass in your face, bitch\nChuck Norris\u2019 nunchucks morph into guns, swords\nThis is what blood sport is\nThe goriest, glorious, notorious bigamous, shogun warriors\nGod damn, the Slaughter boy general\nOnce I slaughter it, you couldn\u2019t un-slaughter it\nOnce I order a hit, you couldn\u2019t un-order it\nHit's an order, this the consortium\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nFrom the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up\nAll day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)\nSo I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger\nAlways, \u2018cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nIf I don\u2019t got no more drama, bitch, I\u2019m a fish outta water bottle\nAfter all these guys I slaughter\nApplause is gettin' louder, how the fuck did this happen?\nI never rapped for bitches, how's it that my audience now is broader?\nDevil without a cause, rebel without a pause\nI am a kaze without the kami\nYou wouldn\u2019t be a G if you cost me a thousand dollars\nInfrared in my pencil lead\nBut always keep an extra one stocked though\nIn the back pocket and both of 'em locked\nAnd they're loaded, like cocked twin Glocks that I\u2019m holdin'\nYou better pause when you see these two dots on your colon\nFuckin' punks, you wait, just got to rockin' and rollin'\n'Cause Elvis ain\u2019t left the buildin' yet, I\u2019m still a villain\nYou feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec\nWith the weapon of intellect, Hannibal Lecter with the black belt\nIn kung fu, protect your neck and\n\n[Verse 4: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nRespect the gun rule\nRead in the Art of War book by Sun Tzu\nYou realize if you defy, you probably won't be around here long\nRapunzel (get over it)\nLook, bitch, I got the bands in my pocket\nAnd the drum roll poppin', that's...\nThat\u2019s overkill, I keep the kill under me\nI keep the chill one degree\nI hit you with a hook that\u2019ll make you see threes\nYou realize as soon as you beat me that you didn\u2019t\nYeah, there\u2019s still one of me, now me slap you\nThat\u2019s a recap view, that\u2019s normal embarrassing\nAnd you slap me, that\u2019s knee-slap humor, that\u2019s hardly hilarious\nSo we scrap over you lyin' like a feline cub in a forest\nCherishing a kill from a dominant male\n\n[Verse 5: Eminem]\nAnd I\u2019m born with Malaria\nForm of Lou Gehrigs\nTo torture and terrify corporate America\nPoor little Erica\nIn the morning the sheriff's and Law Enforcement\nWill find one fourth of her buried\nUnder a barrier of the kitchen floor\nWith the stairs in an outdoor wooded area\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nFrom the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up\nAll day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)\nSo I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger\nAlways, \u2018cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)\n\n[Verse 6: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nBack then hoes didn't want him\nNow the black Benz all hittin' corners\nMy spectacular vernacular\nI spit like giving Ex-Lax to Dracula\nLet me translate: I\u2019m tryna find me a bitch\nAnd then I\u2019m sucking on her neck while she naked\nAnd then I\u2019m shitting on her\n\n[Verse 7: Eminem]\nAnd I\u2019m getting boners from what I\u2019m spitting\nGetting blown to smithereens in a Toyota\nGetting stoned ta Jonas Brothers\nBrothers, songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flipping\nA time bomb with a nervous tick\nAnother murder victim, I flirted with them first\nAnd burrr-stick \u2018em, I'd burn up if I try to step foot inside a church chicken\n[scratching noise] wanna [scratching noise] making sure any who battle me crawl away\nAssault and battery holiday, and just when you\u2019re thinking that\u2019ll be all I say\nI\u2019ll start automatically calling names and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy\nBut I disappear as quick as Natalee Holloway\nIt\u2019s my mentality all the way, I\u2019m normally a suicide mission to try dissin'\nBut one thing I never mind's getting called Elvis all the time\nIn the articles that you write which is why I never reply, 'cause he died shitting\nSo-a, shitting, I'm spitting my infinite supply of written bonafide\nKidding aside, critics take my little white dick in your eyelid like to fuck it\nSwitch subjects, moving on to the next one it's Ch- Chucky\nWho wanna play with number one overall, Kid Cudi\nA psycho buddy who might go nutty \u2018cause he don\u2019t like nobody\nHis knife's so bloody \u2018cause he just sliced somebody\nPull out the Schick Hydro and\n\n[Verse 8: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nIn light of what he, just said, this for those who even kinda want it\n'Cause for this man, I would take a lighter\nAnd light up all of my Lighter money\nYou can call it pyro money, \"Hi Rihanna\"\nI mean wait, \"Hi Tianna\", wait, \"Hi Tatiana\", shit\nI gotta problem I don\u2019t like, it's called fuck a model-itis\nWho pussy the tightest?\nThat\u2019s amazing, sit your ass down\nI don\u2019t like the pussy too tight\nGet the fuck outta here and have some babies\nVocabulary still ill, the 911 still will\nIt\u2019s all yellow with the black stripe, kill bill\nI\u2019m so far ahead of the skills here\nGetting ready for my past life\nI\u2019m the real deal\n\n[Verse 9: Eminem]\nLike Holyfield, think you irreplaceable? Bite it  (that\u2019s overkill)\n'Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill and\nEbola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal\nI\u2019m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel\nOf how I\u2019m- how I\u2019m cold steel like an old closed snowmobile\nAnd no feeling but so jovial\nBut don\u2019t be one of those who mistake me for a joke, I'm so for real\nIt\u2019s what I told the phony emcee before I broke his will\nDrove a drill through his skull to see his soul\nTold him when I snap like a photo\nHe\u2019ll get exposed like a roll of film\nNow here he goes again, oh\nI\u2019m so trill, I\u2019mma get the hoes again\nLike Buffalo Bill's, bitch you didn\u2019t put lotion in\nThe bucket, fuck it, beat the poor little old widow\nWith throw pillows, soap brillos, finished my goat milk then\nSmoke billows I lit up...ah, fuck it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4eafbf7343fa7fa7eb7374ea6f1eb63.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bad Meets Evil"}
