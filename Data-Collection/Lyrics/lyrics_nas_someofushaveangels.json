You form material needs\nThe weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off\nBy stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off\nHis reputation is, bigger than his whole life span\nHe never planned to fail, he just failed to plan\nWhat does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers\nAnd any chance he get, he can take niggas\nHe comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is\nWhen he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me\nYou are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head\nAnd if I let go I'm dead\nHe stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit\nAn out of body experience, so now I feel it\nLookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me\nThem court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary\nI never hate, that's just wasted energy\nThe past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?\nThe future - and time only reveals, what fear is\nFalse expectations, appearin' real\nWe only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told\nAnd I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed\n\n[Chorus]\nSome of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)\nSome of us have angels (the power, the glory)\nSome of us have demons (greed, and lust)\nSome of us have demons (lust, temptation)\nSome of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)\nSome of us have angels (the power, the glory)\nSome of us have demons (greed, and lust)\nSome of us have demons (lust, temptation)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d23a600c139bca90fa38b331a4e93acd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
