She got two\nAnd she just slapped a hundred on the toy\nHoney was a gangstress for real, gettin money off the board\nThen I'm hittin Chi-Town, soon as it die down\nLay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down\nNobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze..\n.. music please {*ahhh-hahhh!*}\nAhh, where was I? Oh yes\nOff to the Valley so I gotta go West\nMy chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex\nI hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, c'mon\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Jadakiss]\nThat I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yesss)\nShe talkin shit on the celly like she that bitch (yesss)\nAnd this how you know it's definitely real\nWhen you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills\nWhen I get there, she gon' show me more than some brotherly love\nTop piece 'til I cum in her mug\nI'm tryin to leave and she givin me hell\nTold her bend over; I'mma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell\n{*BONG!*} Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch\nI oughta be there by breakfast if I leave by six\nAnd ain't nuttin stoppin Ja'\nI'mma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way\nNow I'm down in Miami to see my bitch\nShe got her own beauty salon, and she strip\nI'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world\nThe bitch perform; besides that, her lips was warm, c'mon\n\n[Hook] - 2X\n\n{*ad libs to fade*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/659c95067dc52688c5cb0888483ceafc.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
