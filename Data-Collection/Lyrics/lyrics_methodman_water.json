Who gassed you up and threw a match?\nDon\u2019t want police to line you up and you a match\nFool them clowns into thinking you a snack\nBrought a gun to wash it down and you can drink it through the tap\nThat\u2019s my reaction, now react\nNow try to picture Malcolm X without the strap\nIf Meth Man could navigate the globe without a map\nI could beat the pussy up without a scratch\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nTime ticking teams quick to get ya\nI\u2019m trying to bury about a trillion\nMeth's Lab bitch catch us on ya\nAnd when we coming, we be flowing likes it\u2019s water\n\n[Verse 2: Chedda Bang]\nI\u2019m so ignorant, spend it before I make it\nPour salt on my food before I taste it\nPour salt in your wounds, right in the basement\nAll of us, statement, one vision, rich dreams\nCouple scars, I heal quicker than Wolverine\nPopulation, pink slips, quarter greens\nHood millionaires hide when the wolves out\nMove with security, hold tight to your jewelry\nUh \u2013 that\u2019s my reaction, now react\nOnce your hood pass revoked, you never get it back\nBenzes, Bentleys, nah nigga don\u2019t tempt me\nTrust I got it on me, I\u2019ma squeeze till it\u2019s empty\nLord forgive me, I need that new 550\nWith the cocaine seats, I\u2019m so street\nAnd when the police came, we don\u2019t speak\nFrom my hood to your hood, ain\u2019t nothing sweet\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nTime ticking teams quick to get ya\nI\u2019m trying to bury about a trillion\nMeth's Lab bitch catch us on ya\nAnd when we coming, we be flowing likes it\u2019s water", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fafd5b6184e352f00d35852ac8b31946.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
