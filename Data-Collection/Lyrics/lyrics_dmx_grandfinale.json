That's D\nThe dawg come and getcha outside\nThe more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed\nGun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you\nHit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you\nDrama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?\nBeat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED\nHow MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer\nAnd all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer\nNow beg for your life, one more time, one more crime\nOne more nine, c'mon cry nigga\nIt's over! This is the shit, that hits hard\nYou either the last one standing, or the last one to fall\n\nChorus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/288166688f7c76a7f1c3bcb6c28198f1.300x292x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
