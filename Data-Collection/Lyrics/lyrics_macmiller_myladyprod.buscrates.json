I've had all the dimes and all are fine but now I need the one to call her mine\nYa know that girl that everybody wants but can't have fat ass, nice ass, high class\nI get the last laugh now cause she under my arm, Lay down hittin' L lookin' up at the stars\n\nI tell her listen I ain't gonna do you wrong, forget what you hearin' on my songs\nMy always is gone i'ma be real with ya\nRecently I've been lookin' at the big picture\nPerfectly framed see the way i'm workin' the game\nTake my name i'ma share all my fortune and fame\nBeauty or brains, girl you all the above\nTrue player for real, But now i'm fallin' in love\n\nChorus;\nI'm bout to get high with my lady, (x6)\n\nYou used to the bullshit the dudes put you through it\nCupid never shot up such a nuisence see with me my love is with the music\nBut baby you can be the next to it, my boys say i'm stupid i need to move along\nAnd when we fight I hope you use this song to get it right\nMy moms is gettin' jealous how I feel about her, and the fellas say i could deal without her\nSee baby I ain't playin' around I don't need cupid dude could have aimed at the ground cause that's real, real. Just had to tell you how I feel, and the party tonights goin' crazy, but i'm just here with my baby\nI love the way that she makes me, i'ma just gonna kick it with her and break tree's\n\nI'm bout to get high with my lady(x6)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
