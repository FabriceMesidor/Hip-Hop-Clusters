Do you need someone?\nIs it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?\nThousand words don't change a thing\nIs it only three? Three words that you're missing?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nWhere did you go? Couldn't see\nI was too busy\nCould've just said no\nWhere would you go? I think that I know\n\n[Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, we're back to playing\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\n[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\n[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]\nWelcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul\nWhere it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll\nAin't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control\nAin't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes\nSayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious\nSayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?\nAnother slap to the face, another uppercut\nI'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya\nNot cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya\nI know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya\nBut is you stayin' or goin'?\nI couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it\nHow come you never show it? All this love you speak of\nAll I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)\n\n[Bridge 2: Nicki Minaj]\nI'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win\nAnd I'm coming undone, cause the tears don't end\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nWhere did you go? Couldn't see\nI was too busy\nCould've just said no\nWhere would you go? I think that I know\n\n[Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, we're back to playing\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\n[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\nI could've given everything\nDon't wanna let the tears begin\nWe're back to playing, the crying game\n\n[Outro: Jessie Ware]\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o\nO-o-o-o-o-o, O-o-o-o-o-o", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6951472bdf7074eced144472c3b71c0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
