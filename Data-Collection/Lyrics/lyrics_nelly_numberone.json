Move it all around?\nLet you get a peep before it touches the ground?\nHell yeah, ma, I love a girl that's willin' to learn\nWillin' to get in the driver's seat and willin' to turn\nAnd not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say\nWhat I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay\nOr some, Internet access, some website chat line\nMad 'cause I got mine, oh, don't wind up on the flat line\nOh, if my uncle could see me now\nIf he could see how many rappers wanna be me now\nStraight emulatin' my style right to the \"Down Down\"\nCan't leave out the store, now better wait 'til they calm down\nI got hella shorties, comin' askin', \"Yo, where the party?\"\nOh Lordy, I'd like to continue to act naughty\nMixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin' fo' sho'\nI'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know, pimp\nI am number one, no matter if you like it\nHere, take it, sit down and write it\nI am number one\nHey\nHey\nHey\nAnd tell me now dirty, now, let me ask you, man\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nTwo is not a winner and three nobody remembers, hey\nWhat does it take to be number one?\nHey\nHey\nHey\nCheck it, uhh, check, yo\nAiyo, I'm tired of people judgin' what's real hip-hop\nHalf the time you be them niggas who fuckin' album flop\nYou know, boat done sank and it ain't left the dock\nC'mon, mad 'cause I'm hot, he just mad 'cause he not\nYou ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts\nGimme my rocks and keep my fans comin' in flocks\n'Til you top the Superbowl, keep your mouth on lock\nI'm awake\nI'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life\nTaking nothin' for granted, blessin' everything on my life\nTrying to see a new light at the top of the roof\nBaby, name not Sigel but I speak the truth\nI heat the booth, Nelly actin' so uncouth\nTop down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot\nWith my family and friends, and my closest of kin\nAnd I'll do it again if it means I'ma win, dirty\nI am number one\nNo matter if you like it\nHere, take it sit down and write it\nI-I-I, number one\n'Cause two is not a winner and three nobody remembers\nNumber one\n'Cause two is not a winner and three nobody remembers", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8acc2c921ff6defb4a5463597263ff0e.750x750x1.png"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
