Show 'em the tape jus playin my part\nOpposed to being on tape but the G that I ran\nHad her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand\nWhen I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam\nBring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans\n\nHook 2X:", "image": "https://images.genius.com/550b89543b907f703f98597d3c19b1f0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
