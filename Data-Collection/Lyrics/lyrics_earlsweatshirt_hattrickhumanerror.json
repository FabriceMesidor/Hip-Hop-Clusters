It's that courtesy of shit circumstances\nThe earth is my turf, but the hearse like a magnet\nI be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh\nGentrifiers got the turf getting hacked up\nLate nights thinking 'bout who lied to me first\nGraveyard energy, tied to the job based off principle\nMy inner jit grinning, but my face all twisted\nIt's the artist at work\nGreyhound tickets and some haze on my missus\nKnow it make no sense, I keep my heart on my shirt\nWhen the rainstorm vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking\nTryna harvest the hurt, but it make no difference", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abe116b40a921476ff1094726c8d1a8.608x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
