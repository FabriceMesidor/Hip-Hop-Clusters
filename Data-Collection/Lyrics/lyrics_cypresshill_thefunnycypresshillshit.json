I put the clip\nAnd before I bring ya ass on, what chu gonna do\nKickin' dust on your head like I bust\nMy grip surrounded, I'm about ta get rushed, I'm brushed wit death\nHow many shells stuffed in my closet, with my big Cognacs, cut\n\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(Ya better be ready)\n\nI told tha boyz get tha sawed off Glock\nAnd tha rest of tha gats\nAs I strapped on tha bullet-proof vest\nBoom I think I got one to tha chest\nHot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit\nI still stand tall with tha Hill Clan\nY'all better stand back, niggas 'bout ta fall\nI'm comin out blastin like Yosemite Sam\nGt tha cheese an tha bread for tha ham\n\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(When tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready\n(Ya better be ready)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2615919eb0bcef9d55421080ab3b10b1.860x860x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
