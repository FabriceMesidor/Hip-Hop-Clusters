I just don't deserve this\nI wanna tell mom, but would she listen\nShe's bound to be bitchin' if she hasn't got a fix in, so\nNow I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me\nIf he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me\nCan't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom\nThinkin' how my stepdad raped me in the bathroom\nEvery day I make class and yet I'm missin' periods\nThe thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearin' it\nI gotta tell mom before she sees me\nI told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me\nCallin' me a slut 'cause my butt's kinda big so\nStill that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though\nI can't believe the way he caught her\nGot her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter\nTime for me to break and find another\nThat's when I discovered\nThe ways of the days of a part time mutha\n\n[2Pac]\nI gotta a part time\n\n[Hook: scratched w/ minor variations: 2Pac & Poppi]\nShe's a part time mutha\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nI rush to tend her, talked as I touch her\nShe blushed, the clothes came off and I bust her\nI'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block\nHere, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock\nShe's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong\nPat myself on the back and move on\nIs this just how it is hell no\n'Cause she came back with the kid and yo\nI been payin' ever since\nThe clothes, the food, the cars and, oh, the rent\nAll of my time gets spent at the workplace\nNo time to kiss her got me this in the first place\nSo, I do the dishes and clean the floor\nWhen I sleep I can't dream no more\nOh no, now I'm a part time mutha\nAnd I change the diapers and clean the shit\nThe tables are turned I can't take this\nOh no, now I'm a part time mutha\n\n[Hook: scratched w/ minor variations: 2Pac & Poppi]\nShe's a part time mutha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5206e7f26ff5bdfe6b65dbbc5f699271.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
