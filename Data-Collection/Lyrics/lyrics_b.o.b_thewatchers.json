Hold up, Bob, don\u2019t go there!\nYou know that they watching, the all-seeing stare\nBut they can\u2019t stop me, I\u2019m already there\nAnd y\u2019all ain't seen shit but y\u2019all already scared\nI\u2019m gone, high like fructose, fructose\nYou wanna know the truth? Really, you don't, you don't\nIt\u2019ll blow you out your mind, like a UFO, UFO\nI\u2019m basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto\nYou know, but you\u2019ll probably be the same one hatin'\nSayin' every rapper is in the freemasons\nWhile the cops giving out free mace to your face\nNow how do that taste? I\u2019m outta my mind\nThese videos tellin\u2019 y'all lies, bruh\nTellin' y'all we holding evil hand-signs, bruh\nLast time I checked I\u2019m from the Eastside, bruh\nSo do your research and make your own mind up\n\u2019Cause us musicians have influence on this mic\nBut they don\u2019t like that, so they conquer and divide\nDouble-H N-D, hip hop never dies\nSo shoot all you want, but we fly\nBecause, you know, no one man should have all that power\nObviously \u2018cause it\u2019s only one power\nBut nevermind, y\u2019all keep worshipping Towers\nWhile the clock keeps handing y'all hours\nBut pucker up because the truth gets sour\nMore sour than the sour diesel I devour\nHear me by the hour, I give you 50 vowels\nWhen I brain storm it's like a shower\nSo pull out your towels, and don't let 'em play you\nDo your own thing, fuck what they do!\nAnd if you good at somethin' make sure they pay you\nAnd if not, take a thankyou\nWhether they praise you, or whether they hate you\nIt\u2019s all about the attention that they pay you\nY\u2019all on that grape drink, try this grape juice\nShouts to Grand Hustle, we got that break through\nAnd, yes, it\u2019s evident we better than\nThe rest of these competitors\nReally there ain't no one else ahead of us\nYeah, I bust these verses off, et cetera, et cetera\n\u2018Cause they watching y\u2019all like the Federers, owww\n\n[Outro]\nKadoish, kadoish, kadoish\nAdonai Tsebayoth\nIt\u2019s B.O.B. and I\u2019m out.
