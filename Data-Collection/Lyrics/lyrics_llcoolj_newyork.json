God's god I'm gifted\nBut I won't hit you with the same old money rap\nCause most of the money rappers need to give you ya money back\nI'm just ya man next door, sharp hood cat\nI want the crown back boy, ya don't deserve that!\n\n[Chorus 2x]\nNew Yoooork!, New Yoooork!\nThe Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!\n(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust when ya thought that I was calmin' down\nI pulled a George Bush and I bombed the town\nI got 'em runnin' for cover, ducking, running around\nLike L's on the radio, \"wow how does it sound?\"\nNever been afraid to set it off on these clowns\nEspecially with all the hyped up trash they puttin' out\nThis is for the cats that consistently hold me down\nArguing in barbershops from Queens to Up-Town\nI went to Hollywood and let 'em borrow the crown\nBut they got too cocky, I'm back to check these clowns\nI dare one of yall to disrespect me now\nAnd I'll die before that happens so inject me now\nAnd I'm the best period, fuck pound-for-pound\nWhen shit gets serious, I rock the crown\nMatter of fact, where my real niggas at?\nI got you, New York is on my back\nLets Go!\n\n[Chorus 2x]\nNew Yoooork!, New Yoooork!\nThe Cityyyy that doesn't sleep, New Yoooork!\n(Cause sleep is the cousin of death)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
