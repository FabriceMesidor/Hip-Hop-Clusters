Same difference, I need some 'caine\n'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants\nBrain implants and they say there's a slim chance\nI won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'\n\n[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nWalking in swamp water with an M-16\nOut for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug\nTo break braces, you say grace and make faces\nI'll display hate and break you in eight places\nTake paces, turn around draw in a standoff\nPrecise aim, ice in my veins, blowing your hand off\nDancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving\nI pledge allegiance to forever breathing\nStreet niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger\nFake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers\nWith a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with\nLet the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace\nFor instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil\nA follower never had heart, he just loyal\nThugs is glass doors, I see through 'em, put the heat to 'em\nBe careful you might get what you ask for\n\n[Hook: Royce Da 5'9\" and Eminem]\nYo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip\nAnd if it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit\nIf it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew\nI'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea6b18623746fe7fa4ec54a079b99a0b.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bad Meets Evil"}
