Die with the bad brakes\nHop out lookin' fly than a motherfucker\nLast real nigga alive, yeah I'm the motherfucker\nI thought I told you I'm the hottest\nGuaranteed to shine, left the whole game polished\nTurned it up some notches then send it to the doctors\nBasically I'm super ill, dizzying off a couple pills\nHuh, I put that on my mother's only son\nHop out, spray the crowd, I'm the only one\nHoover Crip style still eating at Mr. Chows\nRide around, sit it down, still let the money pass\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Rock]\nLook, I started from the project, post selling rocks\nNow I'm the project Pope, white city\nWe're supposed to kill for our color\nIt's nothing but halo tips and politics\nSo acknowledge it\nI smoke kush for the fuck of it\nSee my girlfriend with the homie, nigga fuck a bitch\nWhy? On a whole 'nother level\nLook, am on fire like I'm walking with the devil\nI'm grimey but I got my angels behind me\nYou eyeing me, shots to your dome, sleep comedy\nI know the haters wanna see me in a box\nCoz I'm paid never slipping, boy I'm flipping with the rock\nGot ye, see the Jay Rock whipping in the pot\nGot game man, you know my nigga balling on the block\nLike a sinner no it don't stop\nYou can tell the haters they can catch me on Top Dawg", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5be8aea8d73e30772a3a8919cc421f1f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "ScHoolboy Q"}
