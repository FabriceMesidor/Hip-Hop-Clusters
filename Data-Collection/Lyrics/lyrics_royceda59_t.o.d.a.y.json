True Hollywood Story\"?\nCan I hold my own and rap\nWithout havin' to go back to Pharrell or Poke & Tone?\nCan a married man still appeal to broads\nKnowin everything he's spittin from here on in gon' be raw?\nCan a nigga simply spit that real shit\nJust for niggas that feel me or will the system kill me? (uhh)\nIf I drop this album and it sells\nAnd the next one don't top it, will it be considered a failure?\nIf I had to drop outta the limelight for a while\nWould you still mob me? Hell naw!\nYou would not give a fuck about me\nIf I worked a regular job, I don't even gotta ask y'all\n\n[Pre-Hook: Ingrid Smalls]\nIf I was to die today\nWould you pick me up because I'm down and out?\nNa, na, na\n\n[Hook]\n\"T\" represents the time when my hope fades\n\"O\" is just a sign on my mind on my broke days\n\"D\" is for the dangerous way that the flow stray\n\"A\" represents the answer to the question I'm askin'\n\"Y\" is it today I should (die)\n\n[Pre-Verse: Ingrid Smalls]\nWe just wanna see you survive\nAnytime you wanna talk, maybe either one of y'all\nWanna give a holla this way (yeah)\nEvery lady involved is rootin for the underdog\nYou don't let him die today, no!\nOh no - we ain't tryin' to see\nYou go - I want you here beside me\nI don't want it to change - don't die!\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow as far as my weaknesses\nI have a hard time competin' or charting on SoundScan\nAnd Mediabase, I respect Dre for teachin' me that\nMoney is easy to make, but hard to keep\nAs far as my nigga 'Los, I love him\nHe showed me you can do a dope album with no budget (yeah)\nWith lethal rhymes - they get that\nHe brought you into the game, he can take you out outta people's minds (yeah)\n(Die) Those who feel my career will die\nThose who choose to leave me behind\nAre confused cause they don't hear me cry; rather ya ears\nIs ready or not, I know you can hear me now like Mary J. Blige\nI will take the shit\nI will burn yo' bridges and I ain't talkin 'bout our relationship\nWhat goes around comes around with every person\nRather it's life or rap whatever, \"Death Is Certain\"\n\n[Pre-Hook: Ingrid Smalls]\nIf I was to die today\nWould you pick me up because I'm down and out?\nNa, na, na\n\n[Hook]\n\"T\" represents the time when my hope fades\n\"O\" is just a sign on my mind on my broke days\n\"D\" is for the dangerous way that the flow stray\n\"A\" represents the answer to the question I'm askin'\n\"Y\" is it today I should (die)\n\nHooooh-ooooh-ooooh\nNo, no, no\nDie", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2e15d971471dc5a14cf09f1d638b3456.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
