My whole car smell like a woodshop class\nI point 'em out like her, her, that girl with the mouth\nPlus you and your friends\nLet me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010\nSo I'm flockin 'em in, 'til the droptop is rockin again\nBoy I got it locked, if you think not, then you'll get popped in the chin\nAnd I'm clockin these ends, my record sales are blockin 'em in\nGotta thank those blessed to walk the streets to those that's locked in the pen\nMy entourage is game faces, mean muggin, mean muggin\nNow the media is convinced that we thuggin, we thuggin\nMomma told me grow up to be somethin, be somethin\nI went diamond with this album so we buckin, we buckin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI'm so far ahead it's only RIGHT for you to hate on me mayne\nWhen I'm pushin 90 by myself up in the H.O.V. lane\nThey tryin to figure how many mo' women that I can take on my plane\nBein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game\nNow desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims\nCan't get in the spotlight for NOTHIN and it just makes 'em insane\nThat's why some of the niggas resort right back to bakin that 'caine\nAnd sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain\nAs they grow older they'll be feelin a lot of achin and pain\nSo right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang\nAnd you ain't helpin the process out by always cakin these dames\nBut it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57e6650f3864beef0e227e02f76d83b0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
