And then once we get 'em, it's never the same\nYou want 'em when they don't want you\nSoon as they do, feelings change\nIt's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate\nI wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate\nBut so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?\nLet's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face\nPromise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open\nThat I won't be makin' a mistake, \u2018cause I'm a\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Steve McEwan]\nI'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon\nAnd I'm aimin' right at you, right at you\n250,000 miles on a clear night in June\nAnd I'm aimin' right at you\nRight at you, right at you\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSo, after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want\nBut I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once\nI poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God\nI blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms\nDrop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'\nYou won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'\nI put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'\n'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason\nI can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live\nTears stream down both of my cheeks\nNow I let you go and just give\nAnd 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this\n\n[Bridge: Eminem]\nAnd I would've done anything for you\nTo show you how much I adored you\nBut it's over now, it's too late to save our love\nJust promise me you'll think of me\nEvery time you look up in the sky and see a star, \u2018cause I'm a\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Steve McEwan]\nI'm a space-bound rocket ship and your heart's the Moon\nAnd I'm aimin' right at you, right at you\n250,000 miles on a clear night in June\nAnd I'm so lost without you\nWithout you, without you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/32b1e7cdddc997dbeeaf97c279cbcf87.1000x963x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
