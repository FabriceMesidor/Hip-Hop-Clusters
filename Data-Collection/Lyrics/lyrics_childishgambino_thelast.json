Best to go and call Hova\nI was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder\n98 test score in my ThunderCat folder\nMy cousin was older, my mama used to wake up\nDrive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer\nBut I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher\nNow I'm going to a school where I get beat up\nBecause I ain't get down with them other kids\nProbably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there\nMama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there\nGuest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom\nNow I'm going to this school called Rockbridge\nSchool of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in\nThere's not a lot of black kids\nSo I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne\nBut really what I wanna know is why I never fit in right\nLike a fat dude getting on a packed flight\nEven when I make friends in the hallways\nI'm wishing I was someone else always\nBut I'm happy that that shit happened to me\n'Cause it taught me most important is to do me\n'Cause everybody hates you till they love you\nFacebook niggas same niggas that would shove you\n'Cause nobody was jocking my style\n'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile\nSo I stopped writing for a very long time\nThinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes\nAnd this next part, sounds like nonsense\nBut I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence\nTaught me everything that is good comes from honesty\nEverybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it\nShe on her role model shit\nFrom the day that I shook her hand\nI knew that I'd never die a broke man\nSo I could try this rapping shit out again\nThe game need change, I'm a part of it\nPeople tell me I should spit under Donald Glover\nBut I try to keep my real name undercover\n'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes\nAnd I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates\nMy nigga stay down like a winter coat\nI rap about my life, not \"I'm On a Boat\"\n'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand\nOnly ones who do it well's Lonely Island\nSave the raps about your cat, I am not a fan\nLeave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here\nI do not play around with this bullshit\nI am different, call it new shit\nLabels want me to hurry and cash my check in\nBut I keep my shit free till the last possible second\n'Cause God knows that I don't need the money\nYou get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?\nBut this limelight burn like a motherfuck\nI wanna call my dad crying but I hang up\n'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit\nSo I send him a check and tell him to hold it\nIf anything ever happens, want you to know this\nI always took the time to smell the roses\nAnd wherever I am, I am doing fine\nI'm here for a good, not a long, time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7fb2bc257978c0cab9de60c94b6542d5.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
