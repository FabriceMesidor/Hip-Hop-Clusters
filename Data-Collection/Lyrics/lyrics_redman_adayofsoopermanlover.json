It's Sooperman Lover, baby! Yeah\n-Daddy, Daddy! Would you please tell me a story?\n-Alright, get over here and sit yo' big ass down\nLemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...\n\n[Verse 1]\nAyo, I was out to lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked\nBoogie'n to my Walkman with an \"S\" on my chest\n(Bust a move!) Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget\nI smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes\nBut anyway, let's get back to this skit\nYou know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-\nShucks! Lunchtime was up\u2014FUCK!\nLet me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks\nOn the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat\nStuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:\n\"If found, please return to this address\"\n(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!\nLike \"Pchoooooooww\", I jetted to the closest phone-booth\nQuick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...\n(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...\nIn a single bound...)\nBoom! Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling\n(It's a, it's a plane!) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name\nI can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains\nOn a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'\nHe was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n\nRelaxin', feet cocked up, just a little\nWith a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles\nI snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon\nQuick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'\nThen landed at the cat's tag address in the projects\n(Elevator's broken!) So I had to take the back steps\n(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole\nFrom this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold\n\"Yo, is this your cat?\" \"Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?\"\n\"He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan\"\n\"Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?\"\n\"Naw baby the \"S\" on my chest stands for\"\n\n[Hook]\nSooperman Lover, yeah\nSaid they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah\nBut something wrong...\nThere's something wrong with me\nThere's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me\nNo money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?\n\"Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?\"\n\"Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka\"\nWe sat, unhooked the cape from my back\nShe felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked\n\"Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit look thick\nTell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?\nYou bad motherfucker!\" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)\nAkhi hit ya like Rocky\nShe dashed to the room and came back with an ounce\nNegligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth\nReady to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up\nTo mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke\nShe took a sniff, some got on her top lip\nThat bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick\nAnd said: \"Here baby, hit it.\" \"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it\nYou'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!\"\nBut I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts\nCracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk\nThen I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight\nShe ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room\nLater, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it\nReady to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)\nYo, man, shit's thick\nLicked her on her belly then kissed her down her back\nStuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack\nAs big as mine (Ewwww!) This bitch must be craze\nSo I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...\n'Cause I'm the\n\n[Hook]\nSooperman Lover, yeah\nSaid they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah\nBut something wrong...\nThere's something wrong with me\nThere's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/851b0a63d63f6c8548a17f295b615296.1000x991x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
