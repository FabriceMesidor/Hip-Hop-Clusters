Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her\nLove or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us\nIt's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb\nIs never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from\nWe know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict\nShe live with her granny and her younger two brothers\nHer favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible\nFamily history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical\nBut not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut\n\"I wanna come over, what's up?\"\nThat's what I told her soon as this episode\nOf Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off\nI was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty\nProbably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart\nGrab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan\nPassin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump\nI got enough to get me through the traffic jam\nAt least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man\nI'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs\nOr maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next\nSent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts\nI looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette\nEnthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse\nAnd I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose\nI had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom\nI'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem\nI'm two blocks away, 250 feet\nAnd six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street\nI pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see\nTwo niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang\n\n[Outro]\nPlease leave your message for 323-\nRecord your message after the tone\nKendrick, where you at?\nDamn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van\nYou told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes!\nI gotta go to the county buildin', man\nThese kids ready to eat! I\u2019m ready to eat, shit\nI gotta get them food stamps, come on now\nYou on you way or what?\nI hope you ain\u2019t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane\nPlus you got school tomorrow\nYou keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain\u2019t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade\n(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)\nYo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes\nHe want to holler at you too\nGo 'head, Kenny, go!
