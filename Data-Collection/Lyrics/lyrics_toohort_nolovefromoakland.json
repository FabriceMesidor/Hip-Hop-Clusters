Don't ask me\nWent to school everyday, and I still can't read\nI count money like a champ, now ask me\nWhy everyday does the task force jack me\nThe story's been told one million times\nAbout a boy growin up to a life of crime\nI heard it before, you heard it too\nBut now, homeboy, it's just me and you\nYou see, people try to call us filthy trash\nEven though we live better and make mo' cash\nThan they do, I'm not a no-good thug\nStandin on the corner sellin drugs\nAnd just remember, this ain't multiple choice\nWithout a college degree you only got your voice\nYou gotta talk for yours, or get nothin at all\nThis ain't the NBA, I ain't havin a ball\nEvery day is a trip, but I ain't trippin\nWatch my back and don't start slippin\nMoney won't talk, but it looks right back\nEverytime I dip into my stack\nI'm buyin cars, jewelries, and mobile phones\nThings I couldn't get with a high school diploma\nIt's alright, cause I just help myself\nYou should know, cause I can't do nothin else\nAnd you better watch out for the day\nWhen you lock me up and throw that key away\nCause I'll be back on parole\nAin't changed nothing, cause I'm ready to roll\nI go to school now, but just to front\nStill servin dopefiends what they want\nCount 5 to 10, 10 to 20\nAnd I just keep on makin money\nI hope you don't think my story's amazin\nI tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him\nSo many blackmen die for drugs\nI think back on the way life was\nBefore rock cocaine started runnin thangs\nAnd drive-by shootings was a normal thang\nBefore brothers bought Benzes, used to drive Mustangs\n12 years later, and I'm still in the game\nAll my life all I wanted was a few hoes\nIf I was pimpin or slingin at the liquor sto'\nAin't nothin but street life, fuck that school\nAll the squares up there ain't even cool\nPlus my partners at the house sell coke all day\nHit the mall like players, spendin fat-ass bank\nJunior high wasn't shit but a place to fight\nMuthafuckas wasn't learnin how to read and write\nI'm just walkin down the street all alone\nHigh as hell, my mind is gone\nI'm thinkin bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke\nI know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke\nBut if I go back to school and get educated\nBe a old-ass man before I graduated\nSo what should I do, I can't even cope\nI guess I'll get a sack and start slingin dope\nI went to my homie, said, \"Give me the sack\"\nHe disappeared quick, and he came right back\nHe said, \"You owe me a g, I give you a week\nYou fuck up my money, don't cop no plead\nCause in the Oak ain't no love, $hort\"\nI knew right then I couldn't sell that coke\nWhen I was young, it was hard to tell\nIf I grow up and be rich as hell\nSee, I was cool I knew all the shit\nBig bank on my finger tips\nBut I never had a big bank, not back then\nI kicked back and watched all my friends\nMake big money, right in my face\nAnd if you ever crossed them, they be on your case\nYou go under, six feet underground\nYou gets no love from the Oaktown\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nI drive my top everyday like a movie star\nDrive around all night in old towed up cars\nAnd if you stop me, ain't no tellin what you find in my trunk\nGotta live like this, cause I ain't no punk\nSo break down the dank and roll up that shit\nLight the muthafucka, take a fat-ass hit\nMy fingers all sticky from the residue\nDon't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you\nCause life is only give and take\nIn the town where the strong control the fake\nThe wild wild west, that's the place\nSuckers take a bite, and don't even taste\nThe California lifestyle that I live\nMack these hoes every chance I get\nLike a drop SL, three times black\nI'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack\nI'm a muthafucka, I broke your heart\nShe gave it all to me, and I tore it apart\nTalked about love right to the end\nBut I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again\nSo young and tender, also fine\nTryin to get Short Dog all the time\nI take what I want, you can keep the rest\nYou gets no love from East Oakland, bitch\nThat's the place I call home\nWhere the Oakland City players roam\nGame don't stop, listen to me\nEverybody fuckin with the O.P.D\nSlingin cocaine, knockin it off\nKilled some nigga, and he never got caught\nHigh-speed chases everyday\nCan't make no money no other way\nA bitch yelled \"raid!\", that ain't true\nCause you laid down, and she fucked you\nTwo days ago I didn't know she existed\nBut now baby is just one of my bitches\nI don't care what you say\nCause I catch bitches and straight get pay\nYou don't care what I'm sayin\nPunk-ass square ain't got no game\nHoes love me, cause I'm a player\nThey think maybe I just might fuck em later\nI keep mackin though, I don't work for free\nTo be a true ho you gotta pay me\nI spend endless days and endless nights\nPlottin this shit to keep my money right\nI build stages in my mind, and it's all an act\nAll I'm tryin to do is keep my pockets fat\nWith this pimp game, and these funky beats\nNow here's a little story from the Oakland streets\nYou see, Tania had a boyfriend, his name was Jack\nAlways had the bitches on their backs\nJack told Tania, \"I love you so\"\nBut Jack's a mack, he's got several hoes\nOne day she beeped him to say what's up\nHe didn't call back, cause she was only out to fuck\nShe beeped Mike, cause she got mad\nShe knew about the bitches her boyfriend had\nMike called back, and he was on his way\nHe just got the pussy yesterday\nYou see, Mike ain't trippin on his girlfriend\nFine little bitch, I think her name is Lynn\nMike paid the bills always in cash\nAnd if she ever got raw, he just beat that ass\nIt goes on y'all, so don't even trip\nYou gets no love from East Oakland, bitch\nGot sprung, even though it's not legal\nA young black man livin like rich people\nI got this game from a hard-ass place\nIt's on the map, right there in your face\nI see my people, all filled with joy\nNext day they're killin homeboys\nCan't say shit if you sho' can't shoot\nCause muthafuckas will smoke them boots\nYou gets no love from Oakland, bitch\nYou better try to make me rich", "image":
