It's like the game ain't the same\nGot younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name\nClaim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us\n45's and gauges, MAC's in fact\nSame niggas will catch you back-to-back\nSnatchin' your cracks in black\nThere was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked\nSo hold your stash 'til the coke price drop\nI know this crackhead who said she got to smoke nice rock\nAnd if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots\nBut yo, you gotta slide on a vacation\nInside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'\nIt drops deep as it does in my breath\nI never sleep\u2014\u2018cause sleep is the cousin of death\nBeyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined\nI think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind\n\n[Chorus]\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\"New York state of mind\"\nWhere I live, where I'm at\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nBe havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta\nDrinkin' Mo\u00ebts, holdin' TEC's\nMakin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped\nInvestments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks\nWinnin' gunfights with mega-cops\nBut just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger\nMake enough figures until my pockets get bigger\nI ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'\nGive me a Smith & Wesson, I have brothers undressin'\nThinkin' of cash flow, buddha and shelter\nWhenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta\nIn the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays\nYoung bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze\nFull of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed\nFrom what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back\nBlack, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black\nThe fiends fight to get crack\nI just max, I dream I can sit back\nAnd lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\nOr the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes\nI got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane\nLife is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain\nAnd be prosperous, though we live dangerous\nCops could just arrest me, blamin' us: we're held like hostages\nIt's only right that I was born to use mics\nAnd the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes\nI've taken rappers to a new plateau\nThrough rap slow, my rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule\nThe smooth criminal on beat breaks\nNever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes\nThe city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps\nThat's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks\nI'm an addict for sneakers\n20's of buddha and bitches with beepers\nIn the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya\nInhale deep like the words of my breath\nI never sleep\u2014\u2018cause sleep is the cousin of death\nI lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times\nNothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind\n\n[Chorus]\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\"New York state of mind\"\nWhere I live, where I'm at\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\"New York state of mind\"\n\n[Nas]\nBut tonight, tonight\nIn the D.C state of mind\nYeah, yeah\nDetonize, come on\nDetonize what\nDetonize all\n\n[Spoken: Nas]\nThank you\n20 years ago, I was writing that rhyme in a small apartment, in a small room, inside that small apartment. Just living in a world that I knew, talking about the things that I see and live man.
