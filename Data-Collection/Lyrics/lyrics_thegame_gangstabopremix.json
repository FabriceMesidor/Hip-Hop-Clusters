Let me see I.D\nThat ain't you, get out the V.I.P\nI'm rap's M.V.P., toasting up for Pac and B.I.G\nSmoke somethin...\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nI don't know you, you don't know me\nYou don't know the history I got on these streets\nOnly if you see what my eyes have seen\nThen you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's\nIf you owe me, or we got beef\nI recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze\nPause for a minute guaranteed you gon' bleed\nCause that's how we was raised growing up in these streets\n\nGo gangsta, keep boppin'\nRock wit me lets keep this bitch poppin'\nGo gangsta, keep boppin'\nLike back when a nigga was clockin'\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nWhen I say \"bounce,\" everybody in the club gon' bounce\nAll the homies put your rags in the air\nAll the ladies put your drinks in the air\nLight it up, take a puff\nGrab a cup, fill it up\nThrow Patron shots back til you dizzy and your head bust\nMix the silver with lime and call it a head rush\nMeet me in the V.I.P., we on some gangsta shit\nEvery time you see Akon he on some gangsta shit\nRidin' wit me, it'll be a gang of half-naked chicks in the club\nImported from South France\nGot em throwing up dubs\nDrinking outta champagne fountains blowing on dubs\nCristal mixed with Chronic now they throwing up bras\nLook at em rocking all that ice tryna glow in the club\nI make em strip like a chick 'fore she get in that tub\nI'm getting tired of these fake ass thugs\nIn these fake ass clubs\nRunning up, Akon pass me the snub\n\n[Hook: Akon]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd823b680b687dac4f58ed6122bbab9b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
