(that ain't gangsta)\nYour man ran when you got clapped? (that ain't gangsta)\nRockin' a vest with no gat? (that ain't gangsta)\nYou only a thug when you rap? (that ain't gangsta)\nNiggas juxed you for your track? (that ain't gangsta)\nYou ran to other thugs to get it back? (that ain't gangsta)\nNiggas ran off with your packs? (that ain't gangsta)\nIf you ain't bustin' ya gat (that ain't gangsta)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou'd call me Animal if you seen me livin' on lock\nI stay in a box so much it seems like I'm visitin' pop-ulation\nWhen I walk by, niggas like \"Fifty don't play son\"\n\"yeah, somethin' really wrong with that nigga...\"\nMax out, I'm goin' straight for the Glock\nBust a u-turn, I'm goin' straight to the block\nThe things that'll happen if niggas say I can't eat\nDown goes the window....out goes the heat\nI'll make the whole block look like a fuckin' track meet\nSome get it in the leg, some get it in the back\nSome get it in the foot, bleed all over their Air Max\nNigga pump my packs or pay poor tax\nIt's extortion, it happens in the hood often\nClaim more lives than choices, free abortions\nRich Nice says I got a problem with the dice\nCause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice\nI rock shit cause I stay on that block shit\nThat 9mm Ruger to your knot shit\nSee the difference is I'm real and you not, kid\nI still stash crack money in my sock, shit\nYa'll niggas wanna pop shit? I pop clips\nLeave with your blood on my mink in the drop six\nGuiliani and Pataki can't stop this\nSince '86 my whole clique pop Criss\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\n5-5-1 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT\n1-3-4 BRRRAAAT BRRRAAAT\nWhat the fuck you know about that?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f29b6e681d1b1237ec06d01ab616992a.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
