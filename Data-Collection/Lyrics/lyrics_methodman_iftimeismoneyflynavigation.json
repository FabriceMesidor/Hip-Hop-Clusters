I'm from the city of stop-and-frisk me\nThe cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me\nMy pops a Willie, said \"Give her fifty, she pop her kitty\"\nHe Bad Boy and he Poppa really, it's not a Biggie\nSee my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy\nOr I'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, I'm busy\nIt's not a mystery who shot Ricky, but where the difference\nBetween the tr\u00e9 and the dough boy, we bred different\nSo bear witness, this can leave you with head missing\nIf y'all can hear me, I guarantee you the feds listening\nSo I be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog\nAnd after the last call, the bar close\nThis my Cohiba, cigar blow\nEven Tony Stark knows the tension is thick as Wallabee Clark soles\nBut did I mention I'm sick and gotta be hardcore\nHard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for\nMoney over bimbos, that's what the Mob for\nRappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low\nEvery time I rhyme on a track, it's like a convo\nKing, we put the nine to your back, it's like you Rondo\nWhen it come to John, though, I'ma slaughter a John Doe\nDrag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo\nHands on him, we wild style with the cans on him\nThen come defeat, that's my beliefs and I stand on 'em\nGive you the beats, no Doc Dre or brands on 'em\nSome men want 'em, these verses hot and the fans want 'em\nI'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards\nI've been a hard rock before they added the Arm & Hammers\nMy meth bananas, bogus method, we call it bama\nGun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas\nNa-nana-nana, I'm feelin' petty, but watch your manners\nUse proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda\nNo type of slander but tell them hoes, \"I'm not your Santa\"\nJust want the body, nobody tryin' to pot-and-pan ya\nCop scanners, a fuller house but we not the Tanners\nIf shooters bringin' them Hawks out, then it's not Atlanta's\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nIf time is money, I got time and time saved\nI pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade\nNobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made\nIf time is money, I got time and time saved\nI pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade\nNobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made\n\n[Talking: Method Man]\nChoose a side\nMath vs Meth, Cival War\n\n[Chorus: Method Man]\nIf time is money, I got time and time saved\nI pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade\nNobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made\nIf time is money, I got time and time saved\nI pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade\nNobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eecbc338b41b5535b01202d581e34a21.980x980x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
