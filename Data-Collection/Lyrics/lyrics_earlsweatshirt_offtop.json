Yo, I gotta stop smoking backwoods\n\n[Verse]\n\"How you doing?\" And what's your motive, ho?\nI only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw 'em\nTrying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her\nI been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller\nStrollin', easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass\n'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad\nAnd nigga, that's a great lunch\nPoppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks\nHeavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come\nRaised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut\nPeep the evening news, my nigga, we don't do the same stuff\nKiwis couldn't take us, boy, I'm jogging around these bases\nNiggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one\nIt's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck\nI been like this since the Motorola Razr\nWhat a bastard that baby was\nLittle mad nigga missing dad, never praying much\nRight around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch\nTake the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me\nI got this nigga Da$h with me, he sipping on some maple leaf\nI'm only happy when there's static in the air\nCause the fair weather fake to me\nLiving in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets\nDare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy\nYou berries and you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat\nRun a niggas pockets like some errands, make it hasty\nI hope the sheriff keep away from me\nHope the sheriff keep away from me\nHope the sheriff keep away from me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/79df1d18a8b46756cc7a7a92b095d409.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
