Brown getting involved\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd when I'm letting off a round don't get in the cross\nHave your preacher man speaking low getting his cross\nTell a wild cowboy not to get off they horse\nBefore they find out the town law is strictly enforced\nIt's a real bad way to get your name in the Source\nTesting the limits of a dangerous force\nYou ended up dumb, famous and gone\nYour people shouting out your name in they song\nPouring liquor on the day you was born\nBuying paint to put your face on a wall\nC'mon fall back, there's no need for all that\nIt's all good, we all here, going all out\nAll live, all day, listen when the song say\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/338419572381e746b5f1aa0866d2d857.596x596x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
