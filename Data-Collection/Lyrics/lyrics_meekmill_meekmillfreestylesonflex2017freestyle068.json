percs like they was advils\nAnd i've been putting on for my city\n7 summers and they acting like they mad still\nDamn, I showed these niggas how that cash feel\nI even let em eat my last meal\nAnd any nigga go against the squad, you know I gotta make a call and that man killed (let me pop my shit, uh)\nTwo maybachs, couple milli, I'm feeling great\nSo much love when you barely can feel the hate\nThem hoes love when you pulling up in that Wraith\nFor the love of that money your dog'll turn to a snake\nYour homie turned to a rat, he is fighting his case\nThey talked in that federal and he praying they keep his state\nHe praying to make it home\nBut you ain't answer your phone\nCause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on\nHe got your name to 'em like several times\nTrying to put you in a cell 'til you 75\nShould've knew it when that nigga said \"I'm telling my mom\"\nThem people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised\nWhat a nightmare\nI'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there\nCops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here\nAnd I ain't trying to lose nigga\nPlay it by the rules nigga\nWhen you get that money watch the way them bitches choose nigga\nFuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga\nPussy taste good, but it won't feed you like no food nigga\nWe was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us\nTook that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)\nPulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith\nBust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face\nFear of god on me, I got nothing but faith\nLike where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate\nI'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place\nDay 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe\nThey shisty, got a nerve to even come to the wake\nSeen your son and give him fuck if he ain't\nThat's why I'm cut throat\nNew bent truck ghost, I move\nGet the upmost respect when I come through\nNigga, i get up close and personal\nI bang on you vertical when I up toast\nMove like I a ghost get the pie or you sell ghost, gang\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\n\nPut some respeck on my name\nThey got me feeling like baby\nDiamonds they on me go crazy\nSaint laurent on me no wavy\nFucking around we ain't fucking around I can't fuck with these niggas they shady\nI know your jewelry fugazi\nI know the jeweler who made it , fraud\nI know these niggas gone talk about us\nWe getting money they talk about us\nWe never ever gone talk about us\nWe only trapping the tug a dollar\nWait, wait, wait\nI'm tryna flip and get all the profits\nI had his bitch and I ain't call him bout her\nI tell that nigga ''I'm sorry about her\"\nShotty popping in the dog filter\nI'm a dog, I'm a dog, nigga\nI'ma shoot him, I don't call niggas\nOn the deuce like Wall nigga\nCross her over hit her with the oooh\nIn the Wraith, stars in the roof\nLight her up like Pikachu\nIn the ghost playing peek-a-boo\nWait, Niggas can't figure me out, hey\nI keep a stick in the house, ay\nI got a brick in the couch, ay\nSit on that shit in the drought, ay\nSell it for trip of the mount, ay\nStack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shipment, we sending 'em out , gang\nI just got some brand new shmoney\nI just got some brand new shmoney\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\n\nWe went from selling cocaina\nTo selling out arenas\nYeah, get Louis flip flops pulling yachts out the marinas\nDirty young bulls living like you've never seen a\nFlows on jalapena\nMy hoes on aquafina\nI goes the la marina\nThe scoop and spanish broad\nI met me a spanish plug\nHe getting Evander off, that Holyfield I hand him the cash\nThrow me a raw, you know it's real\nDucking them indictments, it was so excitin'\nServing pipers that go to vegas, back when Floyd was fightin'\nCarbon fiber 'rari the tire when we floor i'm buying\nBitches used to tell us we ugly now we being biased\nWe survivors, we beat them streets, young nigga we surviving\nWalk in the building, look at the sheep when they see a lion\nTotin' choppers, ducking narcotics, and we being beating bodies\nMan I be getting niggas pussy just from being biased\nTell me I'm losing what do you mean?\nWestbrook baby, no switching teams\nDrop this triple double every time I'm on the scene\nI won't claim that bitch, that's Billie Jean\nShe's not my lover\nLethal weapon, Danny Glover\nO.J style when I cut her\nPut my gloves up, say I'm not guilty I lucked up\nThese niggas got me fucked up\nBall on these niggas every time I cop\nComing down Collins in a brand new drop\nHermes seats,  with my son lil pop\nWatching cartoons in the back, spongebob\nWins and Losses, we in the building you already know its New York City\nIt's your boy Meek
