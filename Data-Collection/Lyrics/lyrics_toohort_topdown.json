You better check the size, and recognize\nWhen I'm between your thighs\nShit, I get hard from the sound of a kick drum\nRiding down the strip with your diamonds and ??\nShiny bald head catching sun rays\nSmashing down the strip going backwards down runways\nFour eighteens with the zues and the Zapco\nSounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show\nHit a back street and put the top up\nStopped at the light see some hoes watch 'em jock us\nI'm so roll with my electric top\nHit a button, ain't gotta get out, fuck with nuthin\nLet the top just fold up and lay down\nSlamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds\nEverybody knows when Short's in town\nCause I keep the beats thumping hella hard with my top down\n\nDrop the top\nJust drop the top\n\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\n\nNine albums out, ain't changed my talk\nA thousands hoes walked on I'm still a dogg\nAin't changed nuthing but the ho that I'm fucking\nStill riding through the hood all the homies say \"What's up?\"\nGive me my props cause I always rock\nAnd I still gets cock when the fine hoes jock\nStill smoking Indo getting burned out\nStill got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out\nA show, a ho smashed back to the O\nPut them bitches on my beeper then pull some mo'\nCause I bump more hoes than acne\nI guess you bitch can't learn that you just can't mack me\nI'm off of Gin and Juice, don't even introduce\nIf you ain't fucking back up cause I'm finna choose\nI want some pussy that could make me write a Freaky Tale\nDrawls back, bootie cracks, bitch in a hotel\nJust to say you got some Too Short dick\nYou wanna show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit\nCause I bust more nuts than a squirrel\nAnd my dick been in pussies all around the world\nIf you had a picture of it and you asked the bitch\n\"What's this?\" I bet you say, \"Too Short dick\"\nI still taunt the fine hoes and get shot down\nI say \"bitch,\" slam the beat, smash off with my top down\n\nJust riding with my top down\n\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\n\nWe rode the AC transit bus\nSelling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust\nOn the way to a house party, a maybe delux\nSlanging Too Short tapes, making some bucks\nLooking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew\nAsking myself \"How can you?\"\nRoll like the Giants down the foothill strip\nWith beats thumping top down bumping a bitch\nShit I had to have drop, didn't care if I had a Volkswagon\nPick up the beat, had a hoes flaging\nSiding with the top down, lit like a lamp\nBlowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp\nMost niggers couldn't afford to have a drop top\nSo they got they shit cut at the chop shop\nCouldn't tell niggers nuthin way back then\nA lot of niggers died or they went to the pen\nCouldn't even see the homie Short Bubble\nBank get fat and my whole account double\nWhen I walk in a club bitches say \"Ooh God\nIs that you Todd?\"\nMe and my homies just hoo-ride\nAnd take advantage of a life we never had\nFuck eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad\nI'ma do it for my homies that's there in lock down\nRide with my beats slamming top down\n\nDrop the top\nJust drop the top\n\nI got my top down\n\nDrop the top\nJust drop the top\n\nI'm just rolling with my top down\n\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\nWe call 'em rags, you call 'em drops\nWhatever you call it just drop the top\n\nBeyotch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4879adf970510dea7fa29b937a49bd43.593x593x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
