I D.O.C his throat, fuck him\nGuns, I tuck 'em, bitches I bust 'em\nMy niggas kidnap kids like Ciara and Russell, uh\nThat ain't no future for me, now come and touch mine\nYour whole family tree'll get flatlined\nFace off, twin Desert Eagles crack spines\nI ain't jokin' so keep playin' on the batline\nThis ain't Gotham, this is Compton nigga\nWe mix Red Bulls with vodka nigga\nWe blow chronic and sleep with monsters nigga\nTryna be conscious, get left unconscious nigga\nAnd we got rocket launchers nigga\nAin't never been to Iraq, the government sponsor niggas\n\n[Chorus]\nYou see these white people votin' for Trump\nBut they don't give a fuck about OJ\nI watch the nigga whole TV show\nAnd still don't give a fuck about OJ\nAnd don't go out like OJ\nBeat a murder, went to jail for some football cards\nI can't go out like OJ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5470139be6822474317a28c8796fb0da.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
