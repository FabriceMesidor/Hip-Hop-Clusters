Lord, this is your house\nI thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light\nAnd I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight\nI don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me\n'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty\nI think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy\nAnd because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy\nNot because of what I'll do, but because they don't know\nThere's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go\nSo I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see\nAnd I thank You for the love that they've given to me\nI will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray\nYou see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday\nAnd I pray... no, we pray... together\nGet us through the bad weather, and we love You forever\nLet Your thought and my heart go hand in hand\nI first thought but to start, but I stand a man\nAnd for as long as I can, as long as You permit me\nPlease give me the strength I need to live, bear with me\nAmen\n\n[Part 2: Ready to Meet Him]\n\n[Intro]\nWe each walk the path that we've chosen (Yes)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n[Verse 1]\nLord, You left me stranded and I don't know why\nTold me to live my life, now I'm ready to die\nReady to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears\nYou told me You would dead those fears, it's been years\nSnakes still comin' at me, just missin'\nSometimes I think all You do with me is just listen\nI thought that I was special, that's what You told me\nHold me, stop actin' like You don't know me\nWhat I do so bad that it sent You away from me?\nNot only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?\n\"My child I'm here as I've always been\nIt is you who went away and now are back again\nWhat did I say?\" Follow Your word and be true\n\"What did you do?\" Well, what I wanted to do\n\"What have you seen?\" Darkness and hell at a glance\n\"What do you want?\" All I want is another chance\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked\nWanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock\"\nYou see, I left home a boy but returned as a man\nFull grown and I'm still not able to stand\n\"I gave you a hand.\" Well but I was lookin' the wrong way\nFigured out the plan, then I started to pray\nAnd that prayer took me from here, over there\nBack to over here, now it got me like where\nDo I belong, do I fit in?\nThings on my mind, where do I begin?\nIt's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart\nI'm really tryna win, so where do we start?\n\"Thou shalt not steal.\" But what if he stole from me?\n\"Thou shalt not kill.\" But what if he's tryin' to kill me?\n\"Thou shalt not take my name in vain\nNo matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n\n[Verse 3]\nOur Father, who art in Heaven\nI'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27\nNo longer afraid to knock on Your door\nNot scared anymore to lose my life in the war\nAfter what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord\n'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword\nAnd now that I've seen what I need to see\nPlease take me where I need to be\n\"What have you learned?\" It's better to tell the truth than to lie\n\"What have you learned?\" To love my life until I die\n\"What have you learned?\" Violence isn't always the key\n\"What have you learned?\" You can't always believe what you see\n\"What have you learned?\" It's better to forgive and forget\n\"What have you learned?\" Give as you expect to get\n\"What have you learned?\" That I can't go on without You\n\"What have you learned?\" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white\nWhite hate black, it's right back to the same fight\nThey got us suspectin' a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\nI'm ready to meet him\n\n[Outro]\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to meet him", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
