I might be\nIs you best at it? I think so\n\n[Hook]\nYou niggas think the same, I think the opposite\nPut my trunk in the front, that's the opposite\nAll red guts, but the paint is chocolate\nSteering wheel on the side, that's the opposite\nGucci Mane, Southside, thinking opposite\nLove stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli\nYou gonna pay her, eat the box, I'm the opposite\nI'mma break her, cut her off, that's the opposite\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nI was locked up, no sunshine\nNow I'm out and I'm balling too hard\nGot two scrubs, no b-girl\nMy jewelry game is retard\nLike a six-shot, I'm fully loaded\nAt Magic City, I'm getting loaded\nSmoked so many blunts with your girlfriend\nI thought that her head exploded\nIt's ooh-wop in that new drop\nGot four o's in my soda pop\nI'm so faded, I'm so wasted\nI thought that I had dreadlocks\nMake money at a fast pace\nDon't come out here cause it ain't safe\nRoll orange and I drink grape\nI can't feel my damn face\nIt's Gucci!\n\n[Hook]\nYou niggas think the same, I think the opposite\nPut my trunk in the front, that's the opposite\nAll red guts, but the paint is chocolate\nSteering wheel on the side, that's the opposite\nGucci Mane, Southside, thinking opposite\nLove stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli\nYou gonna pay her, eat the box, I'm the opposite\nI'mma break her, cut her off, that's the opposite", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acd9babb757092a69a2f3c9e7eb4a9ad.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
