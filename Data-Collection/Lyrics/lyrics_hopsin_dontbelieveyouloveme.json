(shit bitch), what you taking me for\nI guess a joke is what it must be\nI call you bitch then I call you ugly\nBecause you don't fucking love me\nThe things I do for you, you don't appreciate it\nEvery night I'm up I keep debatin'\nWhether or not I should call up your phone or leave you alone\nThis type of shit'll stay alive buried deep in my bones\nBut you don't even notice that\nAssuming you don't even know the facts\nFuck you I'm tired of holdin' back\nMy whole life I've been so nice and that's no lie\nGirl yo ass is faking with me and I know why\nCause you don't love me\n\n[Hook 2]\nI can sense that fake in you\nEvery time I look in your eyes (it's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me\nI don't believe that you love me\nI can sense that fake in you\nAnd deep down baby I know why (it's cause you)\nI don't believe that you love me\nI don't believe that you love me\n\n[Bridge]\nLove, love, love, love, love\nOh why ain't you real with me, yea, yea\n\n[Verse 2]\nI really wanna solve this but not with violence\nIt's like if we wanna fix things I gotta be the one who apologizes\nAnd that's not the way it should be, I ain't a rookie\nYou got the game twisted up, take a look and see\nI even made you a song on various albums\nNow I'm like \"Fuck a bitch, I'll do better without one\"\nYou ain't gotta be with Hopsin (why)\nI know I made a hell of a impact upon your life, I'll never be forgotten\nBut you will soon as I finish this song cause you've getting upper hands and that shit is just wrong\nMy feelings were strong, it's time for me to really move on\nThe feelings is gone cause you don't really feel me no mo' (fuck it)\nIt's yo loss so bitch so long\nYou ain't gonna stress my ass oh no\nBe straight with me I'll be straight witchu\nBut since you fake with me I got hate for you\n\n[Hook 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm tired of saying fuck a ho then always being gullible\nIt done happened so much I'm thinking it's uncontrollable\nI'm screaming \"I don't give a fuck\" all the sudden\nI'm driving to pick her up even though this bitch is nuts\nI don't even get a trust ring I just keep gettin' stuck\nBut shit I done seen enough, man fuck I should beat her up\nNah, cause if I did that then I'mma get mad\nAnd wish that I hadn't a did that so I just deal with this crap\nBut I ain't dealing with it ever again\nYour problems only turn me into the cleverest man\nNo settlin' in witchu, rather settle with sins\nFor the rest of my life they go to the devil instead\nThese levels have spread way further than I had imagined it\nI should've blew you off when I had a chance at it\nBut no, I was dumb I had to grab the shit\nTried to show you love and now disaster hit\n\n[Hook 2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec74857b2660ee45e3b1d2e79e99c58d.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
