Labels tryna sign me\nDespite the fact that I'm strapped like I'm in a zombie apocalypse\nUh, nigga, they can score how they wanna score\nI don't always be on the charts but I stay on the boards\nI don't do beef, I just make you wear the shit out of this two-piece\nWhenever I see yo' ass like Paloma Ford\nI don't care if they find you at the game and you on the floor\nYou gon' get this fucking E. Honda, not on your own Accord\nUh, now let's put this all in perspective here\nMe, I'm on the legend tier\nYou, you on the second tier, you definitely scared\nYou move like you borrowed the first letter from the word \"faggot\"\nYou put effort to put the \"F\" in \"fear\"\nMy pen is potentially grimace the penitentiary\nI'm the splitting image of Dempsey\nY'all niggas Ren & Stimpy\nEverything about you new niggas is Mickey D's\nY'all niggas tempt me, but even y'all dudes grimace Mickey\n\n[Chorus]\nThat fo'-fo' goes\nAnywhere with me I solo stroll\nThat power\nYou know when I solo stroll\nYou know that fo'-fo' goes\nThat power", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2627cc5445030d64606928667383564b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
