Blige]\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nI hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain\nA damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name\n\"That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family\"\nWell, let me show you how it affects our whole community\nNow Brenda really never knew her moms\nAnd her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms\nIt's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know\nJust 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow\nBut oh, that's a thought, my own revelation\nDo whatever it takes to resist the temptation\nBrenda got herself a boyfriend\nHer boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end\nShe tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family\nWho really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she\nWent out and had a church of kids\nAs long as when the check came they got first dibs\nNow Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger\nBut no one seems to notice any change in her figure\nShe's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby\nIn love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy\nAnd yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever\nAnd dreams of a world where the two of them are together\nWhatever, he left her and she had the baby solo\nShe had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so\nShe didn't know what to throw away and what to keep\nShe wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap\nI guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries\nShe didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes\nNow the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'\nMomma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'\nBrenda wants to run away\nMomma say you makin' me lose pay\nThere's social workers here every day\nNow Brenda's gotta make her own way\nCan't go to her family, they won't let her stay\nNo money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job\nShe tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed\nSo now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell\nSo she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell\nIt's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain\nProstitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name\nShe's got a baby\n\n[Hook 2X: Mary J. Blige]\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nLittle Erica is eleven years old\nShe's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold\nSo she pops X to get rid of all the pain\nPlus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen\nEmotions run deep as she thinks she's in love\nSo there's no protection, he's usin no glove\nNever thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions\nLivin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction\nThe days go by and her belly gets big\nThe father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid\nKnowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion\nPlus she lives poor so no money for abortion\nErica is stuck up in a world on her own\nForced to think that hell is a place called home\nNothin else to do but get her clothes and pack\nShe says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!\n\n[Mary J. Blige]\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\nRunaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)\nRunaway runaway love\nDon't keep runnin away\nI'll run away with you, if you want me to\nLahhhhhhh\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nYeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies\nSometimes I feel like runnin away myself\nSo do me a favor right now and close your eyes\nAnd picture us runnin away together\nWhen we come back everything gonna be okay\nOpen your eyes {*echoes*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d211edacb8de02968540124c6801063d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
