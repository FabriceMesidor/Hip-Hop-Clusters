Jackson\nCause I'm packing heat\nI got the fucking beat and a fucking lead\nDripping on you motherfuckers all the time\nI bust guts like I bust a rhyme\nI bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes\nAnd I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time\nOn Community\nWhat you do to me?\nFly girls wanna get inside my booty\nOr is it the other way around\nCause I'm skating on a skateboard, driving downtown\nAt Peachtree, Atlanta, Stone Mountain till I die\nE-40 got nothing on this\nHorny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia\nGot something for ya\nYeah that freestyle was torture\n\n[Outro]\nI'm done!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a9c598da4e86fefcb845cbbe74706aa.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
