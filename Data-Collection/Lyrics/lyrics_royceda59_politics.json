wondering, and be what you want to be\nWhoa\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, HO!)\n\n[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9\"]\nSeven years and countin', I've been accounting\nFor unaccountable rap problems\nCause accountant countin' this rap dollars\nThe ice watch on the sleeve of the white collar\nLeanin' like the Pisa tower, he's in power\nStanding on top of the black bottom\nYou should pack up now that the dirty glove is with me\nTake your hat off inside of the mitten when you spittin'\nCause you could get it for sure\nYour whole rap clapped up out you\nIf I don't get you back up\nGot you in a morgue sittin' stiff in a drawer\nNiggas I can't be caught, I can't be bought\nThey call me the anti-corp, anti-talk\nAntsy, when it comes to gettin' the kind of hugs\nThat come from a fake thug\nThat show me a sign of love\nWho am I to judge but you would not out of love\nWalk up if I was washed up like the tsunami floods\nI ain't tryna' to bug\nBut that's why you got to shove\nCome on\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green, Royce da 5'9\"]\nDream me a mountain\nDream me a sea\nPut your mind on wondering, and be what you want to be\nWhoa\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\nExcuse me while I school them on how to pay these dues\nTell whoever jealous and want to slay me, cool\nThe whole game got the old bling and Mercedes blues\nEverybody wanna fill Jay-Z shoes\nI call it the Ferrari sniffs, the Phantom flu\nCause y'all sick, what already exists, can't be you\nI told y'all niggas in '02 that I can't be touched\nYo bitch call me sugar dick with the candy nuts\nBut ain't shit sweet, don't get it twisted\nI'll beat yo ass, I don't need wine, I don't need cash\nI'll stick a sock in any nigga mouth in any market\nIf he talkin', he a target, walk in his apartment\nWhile he drinkin', spark him 'til he leakin', coughin' Remy Martin\nCause if I flip my lid, you'd have to toss him in the garbage\nIt's nothin' to toughen you out, fuck is you frontin' about\nWe cuttin' you in, I'm cuttin' you out\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green, Royce da 5'9\"]\nDream me a mountain\nDream me a sea\nPut your mind on wondering, and be what you want to be\nWhoa\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\n\n[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9\"]\nRoyce five nine is a prophet, in every sense of the word\nSuperb finisher, administer words like ministers\nThe tall tales of the low sales of a poet\nCenturies rolled up in the pen that he holds up\nHe holds it the holy grail, when he sold his soul\nHe was since told his flow's, the Da Vinci code decoded\nSince chosen, he prays harder\nBut every time he spot a rival revolvers inside\nHis bible like, Gregory Hines with the rage of Harlem\nPo-po's call the, team Freon, we so cold\nRed like beam be on sight, we got weed neon green\nWe got A1 yay, Celine Dion white, breathe\nYour last breath, you about Five Heartbeats away from death\nCause you the Leon type, so muahh\nMay you rest in peace\nNo more records bein sold, 'less it's me\nFive nine, unsigned\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green, Royce da 5'9\"]\nDream me a mountain\nDream me a sea\nPut your mind on wondering, and be what you want to be\nWhoa\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\nIt's politics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics my nigga (holla, holla at me)\nPolitics (holla, hoooo!)\n\n[Royce da 5'9\"]\nYeahh, Royce Da 5'9\", my nigga Nottz\nThis is a M.I.C and teams with collaboration\nLadies and gentleman, I would like to introduce to you, Cee-Lo Green\nLet's go\n\n[CeeLo Green & Royce da 5'9\"]\nDream me a mountain (Dream my nigga)\nDream me a sea (All my niggas dealin' with the politics)\nPut your mind on wondering (I smell you my nigga)\nBe what you want to be (Dream my nigga)\n\n[Royce da 5'9\"]\nIt's politics my nigga\nIt's politics my nigga\nIt's politics my nigga\nIt's politics my nigga\nIt's politics my nigga\nIt's politics my
