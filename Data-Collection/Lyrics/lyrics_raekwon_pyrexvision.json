Stab it, tilt and twirl, spit in it\nPlus put a little bit of milk in, fiends love it\nSat back, confident in comfort, the light blew out\nAll I see is all white stuff, suds in it\nFour hundred razors in a bucket, seventy plates\nWe thinking ten mil a man, nigga, fuck it\nIt's on, get the baking soda, dump it\nHow many niggas'll pump to get eighty more? Get it jumping\nLive by the code and we thumping\nNigga take this, fuck around and taste a flake bitch, you drunk it\nIt's all in the eyes of the hungry\nIt's all for the wise and the humbly, their eyes came upon me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2691e582dc2839478e49279288d69cb1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
