Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nEntertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters\nIn the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum\nHoly or unholy, only have one homie\nOnly this gun, lonely \u2018cause don't anyone know me\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)\nI guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great\nOr they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\nLike they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\nTo havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass\nBut then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you\nFans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you\nTo get they hands on every dime you have\nThey want you to lose your mind every time you mad\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me\nStrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously\nSo I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\nThey're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B\nIt's all political, if my music is literal\nAnd I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?\nI couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to\nYou're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)\n\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\n(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThey say music can alter moods and talk to you\nWell, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?\nWell, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude\nJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued\nSee, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols\nAnd they wanna get one \u2018cause they think the shit's cool\nNot knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves\nWe entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales\nYou ignoramus, but music is reflection of self\nWe just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail\nIt's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'\nTo bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\nThat's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)\nWho post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\nSo they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die\n'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe\nWe're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes\nThat's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it\nSqueeze it and hold it \u2018cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits\nLive on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43422b323b7a3bec451523ef588603b3.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
