In the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis, where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame\n\n[Hook]\nHe spares no one\nHe was forgotten, but he was someone\nSo beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah\nSo beware of the stare of the Ghostface Killah\n\n[Verse 1]\nBeware, son, I got the stare of Medusa\nWith the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser\nI might shoot ya, make your ass an example\nYou can't fuck with Tone Starks, and not get trampled\nGet hunted like a rat in a field, I hate rats\nHate fake ass niggas that love to set traps\nMurder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm\nBack to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm\nI want bodies, DeLucas, spread into the waters\nI want mothers and sons, I wanna murder they daughters\nRevenge, all I see is blood in my eyes\nLike the rise of your worst nightmare come alive\nGhostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive\n\n[Hook]\nHe spares no one\nHe's not forgotten, cause he was someone\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer\nMetal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers\nBulletproof robes and wave caps\nRevenge mode, nigga, you know Ghost gon' stay strapped\nHunt 'em down in alphabetical order\nEach person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter\nThe butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker\nI'mma send you right back to your maker\nA few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil\nIt's the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel\nI'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam\nYou tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger\nGFK, the pain prolonger\n\n[Outro]\nHe was a lonely man, they killed him\nCause they didn't understand\nThough his spirit possesses a rhythm\nAs the words on this record unleashes the Ghostface Killah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f7b0bafc337b2a4929ec5af75b670f0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
