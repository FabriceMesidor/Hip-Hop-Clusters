pussies, players and fakes\nLoud mouth bitches who talk too much\nDick teasin bitches who never fuck\nSucka ass nigga fake as hell\nA man or a bitch I really can't tell\nSome of you niggas need to quit\nShow and tell nigga you ain't shit\nSayin I got this and I got that\nBut when it comes to you I got no rap\nCause what I see is good for me\nAnd what I don't know just let it be\nBitches gamin' workin' extensions\nHer hair ain't really but two inches\nBald head girls in the Oakland world\nShort afros and jheri curls\nNappy head niggas like myself\nGet a bald head and say go to hell\nBut your a snake your a worm\nBald head bitch you need a perm\nOakland california is the city of liars\nFresh barbed wires with vouge tires\nNiggas tellin' stories twenty minutes long\nAnd everything in it was smooth wrong\nI said why you wanna tell me I don't wanna know\nAll I want is stereo rock\nHomeboys kick it gettin keyed\nSold that mark some fake weed\nTold that nigga here you go\nA big fat sack and you know it's premo\nA 20-dollar bill went to your hand\nYou rushed that money to the coke man\nTo the coke bottle was the next stop\nBut you broke the bottle and can't smoke rock\nBass rocks bass rocks thats your daddy\nYou better off smokin' on a powdered cabby\nHave a white christmas everyday\nCause cocaine cabby is a too short way\nThats Too S-H-O-R-T\nSmoke more coke than Richard P\nHave more money than Michael Jackson\nOakland, can I get some action?\nHey young tender in the 501's\nI love to see when you work your tongue\nSuckin my dick in the back of the car\nRollin down Skyline boulavard\nI said beeeeeeeyach\nWhat are you smoking?\nA big fat dick in the big East Oakland\nI see my homie, he needs to quit\nHoldin' hands with a bitch who looks like shit\nMaybe I'm wrong by what I say\nMaybe that nigga is gettin paid\nMaybe that nigga ain't bein used\nGettin fucked without collectin' dues\nThat's how I work all the time\nI'm Too Short baby got a fresh new rhyme\nFor Oakland, California, that's the place\nHomies got drugs all in yo face\nWhen the OPD cruise down again\nNiggas goin' half off dubes and tens\nOn any corner anywhere\nBuy your drugs from a Oakland player\nNiggas sell squat callin it top\nCut cocaine get a big nigga rock\nCrime went down murder went up\nAnd some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff\nWho's the leader of the hour\nAnybody livin' if they push power\nM-16, 357\nSendin these niggas to hell, not heaven\nSo much death in the Oakland streets\nYour nothin but a target, sellin weed\nYou know I'm rappin the honest truth\nNiggas roll up shootin' guns at you\nThreatening your life and calling you fake\nTill you take your drugs to another state\nAnd sometimes man it's a pity\nCause a nigga used to roll in the Oakland city\nNiggas who take do you know yourself\nYou must be the nigga with all the wealth\nMaybe one day you can own this town\nIf everybody fucked and you are down\nThat's how you see it I do too\nBut I break bitches and you break crews\nOakland, California is gettin tough\nNiggas got schemes for coming up\nNiggas got ways to make big bank\nHittin' these streets like an army tank\nI'm Too S-H-O-R-T\nSpitin more game than you'll ever speak\n\n(music for 10 seconds)\n\nI got mo bitches wantin me\nCause I'm the best dam rapper from the Oakland streets\nI'm the coldest MC on a microphone\nOakland, California won't leave it alone\nCause I'm on this mic rapping that game\nKnockin off tapes like I'm selling cocaine\nFucking these freaks indefinitely\nI never stop fucking you Oakland freaks\nHigh school bitches really like\nThe way Sir Too Short can rock the mic\nOakland, California that's the place\nFreak freak bitch got a lot of ways\nShe got big fat titties size 38\nImm'a fuck that bitch but I can't wait\nThe young girl makes my body boil\nWhen I fuck that bitch imm'a drill for oil\nImm'a put cocaine all over my dick\nAnd tell that bitch it's time to lick\nEast Oakland that's where I live\nThe city of the freak freak freaky bitch\nI spent the night with her she ain't mine\nI fuck that bitch so many times\nAnd that right there I could never fake\nI thought my goddamn dick would break\nFucking too much makes you hurt\nBut I never stuck a bitch from puttin' in work\nAll you bitches can suck me dry\nSuckin my dick for the rest of your lives\nOk baby here we are\nWere just two young freaks in the back of the car\nYou are one who's the other\nIt's Sir Too Short that rappin' ass brotha\nEverytime I talk to you\nWhatcha wanna know is it still cool\nAnd everytime what do I state\nYour still my bitch that's everyday\nAll you bitches cause I'm a hall\nAnd you baby girl my freaky doll\nI'm too short baby now I'm smokin'\nAnother big cabby and I'm in East Oakland\nNot the west not the north\nIt's the eastside baby I'm Sir Too Short\nI can spit a rap and i'll create\nA sucker MC everyday\nNiggas from Oakland, young and old\nRunnin' round here keep off that dope\nSingin my rap at the skating rink\nSucker MC, do you know what I think?\nYou wanna be me so damn bad\nYou wish that you could make my raps\nWhen I say \"Short\", you say your name\nTellin your homies you rappin' game\nBut I sell tapes and niggas know\nYou singin my rap in stereo\nSome of you niggas ain't really shit\nAnd Tony G. is just a bitch\nWhy does Tony rap like me\nCause he ain't no pass high ?\nJust sleep to the world on what I do\nGrab a mic front you\nTony G., you just can't have it\nNothin' but a little light-skinned old faggot\nTryin to rap on the mic\nBut Too Short baby is what they like", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5596228ae8537847e97db188cbe62640.1000x952x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
