Let us begin there\n\n[KRS-One]\nI'm talkin to the little you but, there is a bigger you\nThe bigger you is spiritual, little you that is physical\nKRS is givin you, somethin more than I get with you\nI'm hittin you, splittin you, rippin you down with me\nYou busted that metaphysical rap, at the pinnacle I'm at\nI'm down here just to deal witchu cats\nI never bleep you, I just remind you that they don't need you\nThey gonna keep you for as long as they can eat you\nBut that mic you speak through goes from here to Mogadishu\nAnd how you represent US is the issue\nI'm not here to diss you, or dismiss you\nBut at any moment we can be hit with missiles\n\n[Hook]\n\n[KRS-One]\nHow many MC's must get dissed\nHow many young men must get frisked\nHow much ice can really go on one wrist\nHow many shots get fired at a target and just miss\nWe gonna live like this?\nI walk the same path that Ma$e do\nBut he went in the church, I stayed out to face you\nThe difference between us is not just man to man\nBut in fact it's fan to fan\nPeople that buy KRS-One goin places\nPeople that buy your shit, they catchin cases\nMy people eat, your people cheat\nSuch is the words you speak and you reap\nYou can pop that shit if you like\nBut people that buy KRS-One, they lookin for the light\nLike NYCE, Jada, Lizzard, B.C\nHarold, Symone, Server yo man see me\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f300314f4b269cd7479d10c0e1cab7e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
