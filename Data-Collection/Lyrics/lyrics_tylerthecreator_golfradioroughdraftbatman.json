Because I don't know where my bike is\nI've lost my mind\nCan somebody page Amanda Bynes and maybe she can help me find it?\nPink and blue all on my neck, fuck I'm blinded\nI'm a nigga bitch, bring that pink pale pussy here and take some nigga dick\nSpitting, get it cracking like some nigga lips\nBad to the bone, I don't know where my appendix is\nI'm kidding it's right here\nIn the pocket of them pants covered in white smears\nEngine to my left, Clipse plays in my right ear\nWhen I steer that third gear, people fear when I drive here\nI'm fast motherfucker in a whole other lightyear, what's up?\n\n[Outro]\nYo, that flow is sick\n(Yeah)\nI'm going to figure out how to do some shit", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2eba602e6c097e0d7e79e052930f346b.499x499x1.png"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
