Can I have your attention? (mhm-hmm)\nThere's just a few things that I've got to mention (mhm-hmm)\nThere's girlies out here that seem appealing\nBut they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings\nI'm telling you, as Rick is my name\nI wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same\n\n[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my first example\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while\nPlans for the future, she's having your child\nCelebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts\nTelling all your friends about your family thoughts\nOne friend was drunk so he starts to act wild\nHe tells the truth about the kid, \"It's not your child\"\nActing like a jerk and on his face was a smirk\nHe said, \"Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work\"\nAnd she led him on and tried to please him\nShe didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him\n\n[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my second example\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow your wife, you buy the tramp jewels and clothes\nYou get sentimental and bring home a rose\nGive her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it\nAll your friends tell you \"The bitch don't deserve it\"\nLove is blind, so there goes your wealth\nUntil one day, you see things for yourself\nCame home from work early Mr. Loverman\nYou had a card and some candy in your right hand\nThere's the mailman, he was short yet stout\nHe went inside your house and didn't come back out, bust it\nJust a friendly stop, come on, is it?\nThe mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?\nThe thought alone makes your temperature boil\nYou say to yourself \"She might still be loyal\"\nYou open up your door and stand in a trance\nYou see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants\nCame home to party, at work had a hard day\nLook around your house and you say \"Where the hell are they?\"\nRun upstairs up to your bedroom\nYou look inside your room, you see something brewin'\nCover your mouth because you almost choke\nYou see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat\n\n[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (mhm-hmm)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my last example\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot\nAnd today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot\nAs you open up the door she says \"Get on the floor\"\nShe wants to try things she's never tried before\nShe takes off your drawers and works you over\nShe calls you Twinkles and you call her Rover\nNext thing you know the ho starts to ill\nShe says \"I love you, Harold\" and your name is Will\nThat's not the half 'til you start to ride her\nTake off your rubber and there's one more inside her\nIt's not yours - who can it be?\nI think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky\n\nTreat 'em like a prostitute\nDon't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well\nTreat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09b48445ade4e1b5e75781bcfa6eb3c6.924x924x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
