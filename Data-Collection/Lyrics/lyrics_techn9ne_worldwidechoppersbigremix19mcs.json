Witness\nWith a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet\nAnd I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet\nSyllable burning, that internal damage\nSwing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock\nUnder an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans\nBut instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich\nPick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a\nMotherfucka from inside a 1987 box\nI'm
