Someone usually does\nTo our fucked up love\nYou get me high, girl, scared to overdose\nI don't sleep much, when I do I'm comatose\nMay I propose a toast? Someone usually does\nTo our fucked up love\n\n[Chorus]\nSomethin' 'bout the pain makes me want more\nDone a lotta drugs, never felt like this before\n*Snorts*\n*Exhales*\nAnd you could have it all, tell me what you need\nBelievin' all them silly things you read\n\n[Outro: Female]\nDon't cry, it's okay\nIt'll all be over soon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5c20c657a063eac69a842fc529269744.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
