I don't know what it is to live out\nJust reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out\nMy life story is written in a prison sentence\nWonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?\nStill I love\n\n[Hook: Syd Tha Kyd]\nIf you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside\nWhen I look in the sky, I see freedom\nIf you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside\nWhen I look in the sky, I see freedom\n\n[Outro: Bilal]\nIt's gonna be you and me\nWhen you're feeling free make you feel alive\nWhat you got inside make you go outside\nThe change in I, it's the realest high\nIt's the realest high\nYeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah\nIt's gonna be you and me\nWhen you're feeling free make you feel alive\nWhat you got inside make you go outside\nThe change in I, it's the realest high\nIt's the realest high\nYeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah\nIt's gonna be you and me\nWhen you're feeling free, make you feel alive\nWhat you got inside make you go outside\nThe change in I, it's the realest high\nIt's the realest high\nYeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah\nIt's gonna be you and me\nWhen you're feeling free, make you feel alive\nWhat you got inside make you go outside\nThe change in I, it's the realest high\nIt's the realest high\nYeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/565646b92582d86f0446dc67906334c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
