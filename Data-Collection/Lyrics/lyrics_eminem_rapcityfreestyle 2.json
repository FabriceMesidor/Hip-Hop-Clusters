What am I on?\nTwo tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon\nEatin' a crayon, settin' fire to rayon\nFlamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', \"Die, blondes\"\nStrike matches on white patches of dry lawns\nAnd I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants\nFive blunts, and you expect me to die once\nWith nine lives, fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?\nSuicidal, my friends tell me to try knives\nYou wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives\nOut of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?\nDoin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries\nIt's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all who see me flee", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
