know not to fuck around with this shit though\nI don't give a fuck how nasty niggas get\" \"Nah son\nLet me tell these niggas something, God\nI don't want niggas sounding like me... on no album\nKeep it real, get your own shit, man, and be original\n\"Word up\" \"That's all, man\" \"Be a better man\"\n\"And you gon', you gon' come out on your own way\nWhatever how you gon' take it, man, fuck it\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\n[Verse 1: Logic]\nAyo, I force MC's to bleed, retreat and recede\nThat's the Young Sinatra creed, killin' a track with incredible speed\nAnd doin' it like it's nothin', no bluffin', gotta kill it everyday though\nSlice MC's like Kato, gotchya head spinnin' like dreidel\nAssassinate 'em so fatal, grip the heat and then tell ya to freeze\nGettin' cheddar at negative thirty degrees\nI'm talkin' mula, money, euro, dollars, that yen\nBlow it, let's spend it again, I'm livin' the life until the end\nCan't comprehend what I got goin', never knowin' when Logic flowin'\n'Cause I'm creepin', like ether the way that I seep in\nSwimmin' in women like the deep end\nChillin' with shorties that smoke reefer and blow like Aretha, uh\nNow, Sinatra said the best revenge is massive success\nI guess that's women and multiple digits in excess\nYa family broke bread, but my family's bread was soggy\nTill my brothers broke bricks like Mr. Miyagi\nNow what the fuck\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]\n\"Bring it on if you think you can hang\"\n\"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"You are watching a master at work\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think\u2014\" (Yeah, uh, yeah) \"Logic\" (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nAll of a sudden I feel the inner killer emergin'\nNever splurgin', bingin' money and never purgin'\nUrgin' women to fuck on the rug 'cause it's imported Persian\nThen bypass matters of the heart like a surgeon\nNow, it's hard to ball when there's problems within the inner circle\nOne moment they cool as Stefan then flip it like Urkel\nOr flip it like keys, yeah, they flip it like ki's\nFrom drug lords overseas that export it with ease\nBitch please, we stack cheese so old, it's mold\nI'm 'bout that money, so excuse me if my heart is cold\nThe magnum deployed, then I destroy mattresses\nLate night love affairs with New York City actresses (\"Rat Pack niggas\")\nI broke in the game and destroyed the first couple stages\nVisionary takin' over regardless of our ages\nMakin' history today to solidify in the pages of tomorrow\nThe industry is fucked, nothin' but sorrow, but I'm\nPlayin' for keeps in other words no need to borrow\nSo you can keep your advances, wack hooks, and pop dances\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all about the mainstream\nAs long as I sign the deal I want and have the same team\nAnd now they trippin' like a flight to Vegas\nTellin' me that I'll never make it and this shit is outrageous\nNow what the fuck...\n\n[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]\n\"Bring it on if you think you can hang\"\n\"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"You are watching a master at work\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think\u2014\" (Yeah)\n(Motherfucker) \"Logic\"\n\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nTherefore you're never mourn like a memory repressed\nMC's digest quicker than bullets shot from a gat with the barrel suppressed\nOne to the dome, two to the chest\nIf by chance they got a vest, however nevertheless\nI'm lookin' for that real deal, shit that make me feel\nPleasure and pain, ain't no way to measure the game\nI got haters in fifty-seven languages, watch me vanquish this\nThe come up, bust quicker than .357 caliber\nSharp as Excalibur, crushin' muthafuckas like Gallagher now\nTime is money, something you can never recoup\nSo stop wastin' mine, hit rewind and then fuckin' regroup\nNever messed with them chicken heads, but catch me in the coup\u00e9 (\"Rat Pack niggas\")\nNever in public 'cause I'm a studio fiend\nRockin' diamonds and gettin' money, we call that ice cream\nNow, allow me to give you the scoop, shit, I'll make it a double\nI came up around more rocks than Barney Rubble\nMurderers and drug dealers, I knew it no rebuttal\nAin't no need to claim it, picked up the heat, but never aimed it\nNow Jay gave us The Blueprint, I lay the foundation\nTell ya what I'm facin', bars like incarceration\n'Cause my mind is always racin', ain't no time for vacations\nI'm never pacin', unless I'm on the phone talkin' business\nGet wit' this, best witness like Christmas, I'm fuckin' rappin'\nWalk in the spot and all these haters go for the dap and\nI never carried 'em, kill 'em with kindness then bury 'em, yeah\nI was born with talent, God gave me the gift\nAnd now I pull more strings than guitar riffs\nWhat the fuck\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Samples (Logic)]\n\"Bring it on if you think you can hang\"\n\"I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang\nAnd if not then let me do my thing\" \"You are watching a master at work\"\n\"Yeah, bring it on if you think\u2014\"\n(Now that's all Sinatra everything)\n\n[Outro: Samples]\n\"Sinatra\"\n\"Rat Pack niggas\"\n\"Young Sinatra\"\n\"East Coast flow at its finest\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cb73fd1e86a44f861bc4ba694c17126.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
