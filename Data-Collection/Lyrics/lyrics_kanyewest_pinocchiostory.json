I ask you tonight\nTo live a real life\n\n[Hook]\nI just wanna be a real boy\nThey always say \"Kanye, he keeps it real boy\"\nPinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy\nPinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's funny\nPinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it\nI tell the truth, and I keep running\nIt's like I'm lookin for something out there, tryna find something\nI turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing\nWhat does it feel like, to live real life, to be real?\nNot some facade on TV that no one can really feel\nDo you really have the stamina?\nFor everybody that sees you that say, \"Where's my camera?\"\nFor everybody that sees you to say, \"Sign a autograph\"\nFor everybody that sees you cryin that say you oughta laugh\nYou oughta laugh\n\n[Hook]\nI just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes\nI just wanna be a real boy, Pinocchio's story goes\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd there is no Gepetto, to guide me\nNo one, right beside me\nThe only one, was behind me\nI can't find her no more, I can't call her no more\nI can't...\nThe only one that come out on the tour and stays\nBack when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream\nAnd the fame will be get got\nAnd the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault\nAll my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream\nChasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen\nAnd when uh, the Benz was left\nAnd the clothes was left, and the hoes was left\nYou talk the hoes to death, thinkin' the money that the-\nYou spend the dough to death\nAnd tell me what be left, for a real boy!\nThey say \"Kanye, you keep it too real boy\"\nPerspective, and wise man say\nOne day, you'll find your way\nThe wise man say, you'll find your way\nThe wise man say, you'll find your way\nWise man say", "image": "https://images.genius.com/faeb303859cd267990780cd14e99cb73.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
