Who do it better, we used to move together\nNow we not together, is this our new forever?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHell nah, I'm waiting on your call\nTold you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls\nIssues that I had\nSome say it comes from not seeing my dad\nKeep moving on\nHard for me to stay away and stay in touch\nGirl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch\nThought I was okay but nights that I stayed up\nAss got me layed up, girl I never gave up\nOn you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough\nI know your young and you gotta live your life ma\nI thought it was the right time for me to wife ya\nI must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest\nSo confusing losing love, I'm saying god bless\nWho do it better, we used to move together\nNow we not together, is this our new forever?\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c8aea6a11c5d9bc44d2a6101d96d5aed.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
