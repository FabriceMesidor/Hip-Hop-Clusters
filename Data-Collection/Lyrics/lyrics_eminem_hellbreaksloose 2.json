Man, you better lay off the blunts\nYou must be smoking something\nYou think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts\nNow hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust\nShake all them cobwebs loose\nLoosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose\nYeah, girl, shake that caboose\nI don't wanna see you try to make no excuse\nD-R-E is on the loose\nA mongoose when it comes to the chronic use\nYou know I can't stand to lose\nMe and my goons are like animals\nWe come through like a pack of wolves\nAnd we came here to retract the roof\nYeah, man, ain't that the truth\nGirl, your man's back in the booth\nDefinitely back up in this bitch\nAnd this is when all hell breaks loose\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on\nAnd hell breaks loose\nTry to restrain us, you can't contain us\nWe're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do\nEverywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse\nTo just cut loose\nSo this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on\nAnd hell breaks loose\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nNow I know you're feeling discouraged\nBut, homie, just mark my words\nI'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow\nAs soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe\nI'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go\nWe're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows\nFerocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho\nWith speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock\nMe and Doc then proceed to drop E\nAnd hop out the vehicle and knock on your door\n\n[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]\nYeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow\nWe ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you\nRevenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet\nYeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat\nLose yourself indubitably\nPass up on that little cute chick right there?\nThat'd be pretty damn stupid to me\nBorn and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets\nThem haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep\nKeep that deuce-deuce in the seat\nDre fall off? That's news to me\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nNow this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on\nAnd hell breaks loose\nTry to restrain us, you can't contain us\nWe're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do\nEverywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse\nTo just cut loose\nSo this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on\nAnd hell breaks loose", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5546c9a9597f9358cefcc9ba44d8bbf0.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
