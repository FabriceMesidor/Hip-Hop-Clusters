About to throw 'em away\nWith the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ\nUsually I take them off with Oil of Olay\nMCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay\nHot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?\nWorking on a way that we can roll away tinted\nSome say the price of holding heat is often too high\nYou either be in a coffin or you be the new guy\nThe one that's too fly to eat shoo pie\nNever too busy when it comes down to you and I\n(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die\nThey need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry\nYou're on the list, if not, pick a number spot\nTen and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat\nI coulda had a V-8\nF-150 quad cab but I'll be straight\nMoney comes and goes like that two bit hussy\nThat night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie\nSo I can calm down so they don't get it twisted\nTake it from the fire side, it won't get blistered\nGot it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit\nThese metal fingers be holding (hot shit)\n\n[Verse 3: Count Bass D]\nWhen I was four, I penned \"God Was Born In New York\"\nBack in '77, still got nan in the crescent\nThe effervescence of God's presence is thick\nUnlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker\nPeace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers\nLooked her up and down said, \"Hmm, too much makeup\"\nPoor music taste, ten years from being grown up\nRappers don't blow up heads do (aww shit)\nMy name is Dwight Spitz, I'mma Sonic addict\nI use to think it was merely a nagging habit\nBorn under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine\nI strive to flip it into fine wine\nBarely born a virgin is what the stars said\nBlack not white, red all over though like Elmo\nTwenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking\nI make music every weekend\nIt's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love\nI get mad love but I detest the labor\nAnd its wages, you know death\nI'm servin' life from this gift of God\nDon't forget your potholders, my niggas (more hot shit)\n\n[Outro]\nA short time later", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f67af5eb94d7101171adfff4ca96a76c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
