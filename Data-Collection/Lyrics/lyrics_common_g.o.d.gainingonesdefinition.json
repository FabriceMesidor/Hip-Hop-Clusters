Who knows?\nAnyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves\nSo bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nYo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn\nBegan, began with time\nBeing my bloodline is one with the divine\nIn time brother, you will discover the light\nSome say that God is Black and the devil's White\nWell, the devil is wrong and God is what's right\nI fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear\nThe rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear\nAs a child, given religion with no answer to why\nJust told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die\nCuriosity killed the catechism\nUnderstanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to\nAnd became a slave to master self\nA rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health\nMy mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons\nQur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital\nAnd got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys\nYou just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief\nBut one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em\nAnd use religion as an emblem\nWhen it should be a natural way of life\nWho am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right\nThat's who got you doing right and got you this far\nWhether you say \"in Jesus name\" or \"Hum do Allah\"\nLong as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you\nYou let that show towards others in the things you do\n'Cause when the trumpets blowin', 24 elders surround the throne\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get home\nOnly 144,000 gon' get it, baby\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me\n\n[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]\nLet me voice my concern\nSo many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn\nOur ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence\nSubconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince\nI've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place\n'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place\nSo I try to find the clue in you\nBut evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do\nWhy're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden\nDamn, something in me wanna know who I am\nSo I began my search, my journey started in church\nIt gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief\nHustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets\nTaught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with\nAnd I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school\nIt almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal\nTakin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran\nSearched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites\nHold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White\nSome leads were granted with insight\nAnd it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand\nHe still created with the imperfection of man\nSo, with following I disagree\nBy no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but\nI do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind\nThat's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas\nYou gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity\nBut one side you gonna have to choose\nAny chance to speak I refuse to misuse\nSo how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession\nBecome an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson\nIf a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\n\n[Hook]\nI've lived and I've learned\nI have taken and I've earned\nI have laughed, I've cried\nI have failed and I have tried\nSunshine, pouring rain\nFound joy through all my pain\nI just wanna be happy with being me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c13069157cf82b06434a58c5005ed904.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
