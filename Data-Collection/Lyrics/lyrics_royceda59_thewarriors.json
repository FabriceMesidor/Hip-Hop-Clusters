He be the best\nComputers rank me number one, blame the BCS, it's they fault\n\n[Verse 6: Joell Ortiz]\nAsk about your boy, I'm nice with my hands\nMaybe that's why, every last thing I write is a jam\nMinus the fans, the flights to Japan, I am the man\nAnyone who feel they could see me is in dire need of a eye exam\nMy mind expands wider than the fanbase of a fire band\nAnd what I release from my diaphragm, sticks to you\nLike the wrists of Spiderman, fool a average listeners\nWhat you liars can do but you will die a scam\nWhen I die they will retire my entire hand\nFor years of scripted whoop-ass, making intruders try a can\nI guess the moral of the story is Joell's victorious\nAnd everything's all gravy like Notorious\n\n[Verse 7: Crooked I]\nI left a nigga dead cause he said he was ready for I\nLet the Beretta give him wings since he said he was fly\nI'm in my Chevy riding to \"Bar Exam\" and \"Mood Muzik\"\nThey the closest to \"Reasonable Doubt\" and \"Ready to Die\"\nCrooked I, watch for snitches and wire devices\nMy 45th, fire in crisis, lift you higher than prices\nAll my ice, and on the mic, I am the nicest\nMe and my bitch ride for life like Osirus and Isis\nYeah, word to Run-D.M.C. I'm Tougher Than Leather-face\nNever threw a gun in the trash but they call me Weapon Waist\nIt's like you moving from the projects to the Hamptons\nThe way my hammers be sending bastards to a better place\n\n[Verse 8: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nLet me set it straight, they fans been led astray\nNiggas keep gassing with guns with unleaded spray\nThey don't know they one flow, one medic away\nFrom being taken away from here in the leaded state\nI handle all of my serious issues with metal\nI stick you so deep in the earth your zipper can tickle the devil\nI'm skipping the pick and the shovel, I'm picking you up\nAnd I'm shoving your head in the mud 'til your kickings is level\nPardon I live for the moment, you rhymin I give the atonement\nLike the Indians, I scalp and I wig the opponent\nBut I'm a chief, matter fact I'm a beast\nI'm a mothafuckin' Slaughterhouse G, boom!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13187be577e518c77f5c6ac278ec366a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
