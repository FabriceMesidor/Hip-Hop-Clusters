But change is inevitable. One reason we don\u2019t like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it\u2019s not perfect we accept it, because it\u2019s familiar. And what happens is, because we\u2019re not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do. Just because God\u2019s blessed you where you are doesn\u2019t mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you\u2019re going to be successful, you have to be willing to change. Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who\u2019s speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever. If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f82de3014729a2e050d1a720e25e7ca1.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
