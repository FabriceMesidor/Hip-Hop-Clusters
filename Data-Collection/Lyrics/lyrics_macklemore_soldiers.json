Just ain't funny\nProving sometimes you gotta take something to make money\nMy man\u2019s homie snitched and said that he planned to hit\nAnd he\u2019ll be out when he\u2019s 46\nNow ain\u2019t the game something\nThe soldiers follow the same orders\nThe generals are Crips folk and south of the border\nNortenos and bloods\nNow is it a kid with a gun or the system he lives in that has his disorder\nIf there\u2019s a fiend on the block, somebody\u2019s serving em\nIf there\u2019s a teen with a Glock, there\u2019s a cop looking to turn 'em in\nIf you have something I want, there\u2019s somebody murdering\nSince 1492, where the fuck do you think we learned it from\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
