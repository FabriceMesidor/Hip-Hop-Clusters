(1, 2, 3)\n\n[Verse]\nThey keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best\nJay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it\nFrom the fact that I'm comin' back\nOr maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that\nMaybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap\nWhile I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques\nI'm still sick, how can I be sick this long\nAnd I'm still alive, Magic Johnson of rhymes\nI thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died\nThat's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there\nDamn I forgot how much money he got\nOn the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay\nIn the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot\nWhen you gonna learn how much money we've earned\nHow does it feel to know I came in this game at 25\nAnd coulda retired at 29 in my 20's still\nAnd Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit\nAnd he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick\nNo more, oh boy, goddamn did he score\nTo go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store\nAnd Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us\nMy ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers\nSo stay the fuck off us, we make pay\nI'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?\nTil I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'\nSmart asses, kiss a smarter ass then\nI'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards\nI'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3b62ea7f32a56878fc057ade949274d.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
