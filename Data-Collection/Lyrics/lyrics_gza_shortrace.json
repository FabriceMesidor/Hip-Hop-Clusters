State, why wait?\nYou trying to get paid by the lake\nIn each state, and do the shit at high pace\n\n[GZA]\nUnder the dirt, there was nothing left but bones\nA lot of tall grass around his tombstone\nHis mother left alone, her heart felt sorrow\nNo time to play with the precious time we borrow\nThey live next door, but he was worlds away\nIn reality, but such a high price to pay\nHe was easy to recognize from his dress code\nNothing but a firework about to explode\nA short fuse, who was bound to lose in the struggle\nHis grandparents went through a great deal of trouble\nTo keep him out of jail, they even put they house on sale\nTo post bail, but the kid still failed\nI remember when he called collect from behind bars\nSuffering from two injuries and nine scars\nHe said he'd give anything to be out the pen\nBut it would be his permanent home until the end\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Rock Marcy]\nWait, I got to get mines\nWith a side of French fries, not kid sized\nSixes fives, I give off a pimp's vibe\nIs it the vines? Watch like a sitcom\nThrowing rocks with my pitching arm\nMore bricks than when the Knicks is on, I'm sitting on\nShitting on your boss, been written off\nShots I'm licking off, the top like a different source\nRipping this raw like a kitchen chore\nThat's a block not chicken broth\nHold the pot with your mittens on\nDicks kicking in the door, and went to pick me off like a lintball\nJumped out the fifth floor it's a pit fall\nWhen I hit the lawn, shit it fell like a jigsaw\nRather get hit at the board, then to get tossed\nWent to court, got shipped off like a brick of soft\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aec3826e892d3ad57deb62e63fed42c5.940x940x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
