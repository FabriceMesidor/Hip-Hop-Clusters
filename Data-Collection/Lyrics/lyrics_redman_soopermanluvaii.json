So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em\nWith they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em\nFifty-four eleven Reeboks bitch which you need not\nTo do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots\nSlow your monkey ass down and hold your horses\nDon't wanna know your name don't wanna know none of your sources\nJust fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki\nSo bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie\nAnd plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong\nWhere the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song\nOooh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya\nSlurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do\nLet's take a journey up in the stars where I live at\nWhere I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah\nGrab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her\nDon't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker\nAnd it's on\n\nVerse Two: Redman\n\nWe landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up\nBought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker\nShe said, \"I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny\nSo I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story.\"\nYou go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure\nWhere you from, the projects? \"Yeahhhh, but I'm single\nYou needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit\nMy pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!\"\nOh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me\nShe lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly\n\"So what you think of that?\" I threw that bitch back on my back\nShit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat\nI lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk\nGot R2-D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work\nSee I got the block sewn \"Oooh baby let's get it on!\"\nAbout time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin\nShe rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire\nShe tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire\nShe took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind\nBut with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind\nSo I broke out the ropes, smacked the ho, then suplexed her\nShe pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S was\n\"Oh shit I'm shot!\" There was blood all over my finger!\nI think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner\nShe gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond\nIt was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms\n\"Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo?\nDid Superman have a gun?\" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do!\nSo I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open\nHad another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit\nAnd I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick\nPa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness\nJob well done I cleaned myself in a hurry\nOops! Gotta catch this blunt session\nWith I Dream of Jeannie and Keith Murray\nAiyyyo-yo-yo Keith aiyyo what's up?\nAiyyo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d90c906f33a174fa71425b4dd339eb96.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
