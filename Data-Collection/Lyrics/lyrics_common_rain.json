Then what am I stressing for?\nWe tight, then why can't I let it go?\nEverything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor\nLet it rain cause it's ancestral\nCleanse my heart so they can see the best in you\nLet it rain and come down visceral\nFor those no longer here in the physical\nLet it rain cause it's like tears from you\nJust like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do\nLet it rain, I know that it's purposeful\nSo that it can service you and return to you\nLet it rain, let the rain surround me\nAnd never drown me, I was lost when it found me\nNow in a dream is where I'll be\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nNow in a dream is where I'll be\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nImperial reign came down to crown me\nNow in a dream, a dream is where I'll be\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nAnd if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain\nLet it rain, let it rain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/565646b92582d86f0446dc67906334c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
