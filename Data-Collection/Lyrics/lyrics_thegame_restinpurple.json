Don't nobody even know yet\nAll I know is I ain't ready to go yet\nSo I jump in that purple Lambo\nThrow in that Bryson Tiller, \"Rambo\"\nAfter that its \"Purple Rain,\" its \"Purple Rain\"\nMan its Purple Rain on repeat\nFirst Michael Jackson, then Whitney Houston\nNow Prince, its a 3 peat\nAnd if you see me in traffic its three beeps\nAnd you know what's crazy? He was 57 with no kids\nSo I'mma hug mine \u2018cause a nigga probably only got 21 more years to live\n21 more years to breathe\n21 more years to feel the sun rays\nTo fill collection pots up on Sundays\nAnd 21 more years to wake my kids up on Monday\nWe all die one day\nEverybody gotta go someday\nNatural causes or the gun play\nSince we was born we all been had it one way\nAin't no time to be askin' God why\nAnd ain't no tears man I'ma let the doves cry\n\n[Hook: Lorine Chia]\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nI see purple in the sky\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nFeelin' purple, might pour some lean today\nWhen God take a star, he make a star, yeah go on, dream today\nIn the red Corvette gettin' cream with the top down\nDiamonds and pearls all around your neck and that rain purple when it drop down\nYeah darling Nikki, I think its our time\nI want to be your lover, then we gon' party like it's 1999\nGet used to the pop life, we gon' live it\nCelebrate it like Pac's life, yeah who else wit' it?\nI remember watching Purple Rain when I was 5\nMy mom and dad fought the same way as yours, I ain't understand why\nAin't nobody perfect, ain't none of us the same\nWe all wanna leave the past behind us, sometimes we change our names\nWell we can't change who we are, can't take the pain away\nSo live your life and love your family, don't take the world in vain\nI'ma light one in your memory, \u2018cause the time has come\nThe world lost a legend, but he up there with his son\nSo I'ma pour up in your memory, \u2018cause the time has come\nThe world lost a legend, but he up there with his son\n\n[Bridge: Lorine Chia]\nUp there with his son\n\u2018Cause you're up there with your son\n\n[Hook: Lorine Chia]\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nEverything is purple, I see purple in the sky\nI got purple in my cup and I smoke purple to get high\nI say live the way you want you never know when you gon' die\nMaybe, maybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nMaybe I'm just like\nI see purple in the sky\n\n[Outro: Lorine Chia]\nPurple in the sky\nMakes me wanna, cry\nPurple rain in your eyes\nI see you up there, shine\nYou shine\nWith the sun you shine\nPurple rain\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine\nWhen it rains purple the sun will shine", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/6bb6fdaf786ead8e467fbb1e4d4f5940.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
