(x2)\n\nVerse 1: Yella\nThere's no measure of the skills that are in his hands\nPeople ask \"Is he machine or man?\"\nPositions what he's called or just Dr Dre\nPeople take a look cos he's your future DJ\nWhen he cuts the beat you all will know\nBecause his records start to smoke and then his turntables glow\nIf you're a sucka DJ then you'll have a comic\nStep to the front if you like embarassment\n\nChorus:\nHe's Bionic! Yes!\nHe's Bionic! So fresh!\n*repeat*\n\nVerse 2: Yella\nAcquired the skill that you must learn\nTo become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn\nAlways seen wit you nurses by his side\nAnd you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied\nHis supersonic speed is his ace in the hole\nOver all the top DJ's, Dr Dre's in control\nHe operates in LA cos it's the place to be\nHe's B-I-O-N-I-C\nChorus\n\nVerse 3: Yella\nNow as the wheels start burnin and the mixer explodes\nThe wax from his discs will make you suckas corrode\nRadiation level rises to degrees unknown\nThe circuits overloaded then your speakers are blown\nNow ya hear a loud thunder that vibrates the ground\nCos his hands are movin faster than the speed of sound\nEverybody runs and they try to avoid\nBut it's too late cos the place is already destroyed\nChorus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf3badae49c33b583126057638078bd8.576x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
