Original Gangster\nSong: The Tower\n\nI'm rollin' up in a big gray bus\nAnd I'm shackled down\nMyself that's who I trust\nThe minute I arrived\nSome sucker got hit\nShanked ten times\nBehind some bullshit\nWord in the pen the fool was a snitch\nSo without hesitatin'\nI made a weapon quick\nIf found a sharp piece of metal\nTaped it to a stick\nThen a bullhorn sounds\nThat means it's time for chow\nMy first prison meal\nThe whole feeling was foul\nIt wasn't quite my style\nBut my stomach growled\nSo I washed the shit down\nAnd hit the weight pile\nThe brothers was swole\nThe attitudes was cold\nFelt the tension on the yard\nFrom the young and the old\nBut I'm a warrior\nI got my ground to hold\nSo I studied the inmates\nTo see who had the power\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower!\n\nIn a blink of an eye, a riot broke out\nBlacks put their backs to the wall\nCause it was north and south\nA gun man shouts\nAnd everybody had doubt\nUntil the bullets started fly'n\nTook two men out\nThen they rushed everybody\nBack to their cells\nDamn the pen is different than\nThe county jail\nI'm in a one man cell\nI know my life's on a scale\nI wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell\nThis is my second day\nI got a ten year stay\nI learned my first lesson\nIn the pen you don't plaay\nI saw a brother kill another\nCause he said he was gay\nBut that's the way it is\nIt been that way for years\nAnd when his body hit the ground\nI heard a couple of cheers\nIt kind of hurt me inside\nThat they were glad he died\nAnd I ask myself\nJust who had the power?\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower!\n\nYou see the Whites got a thing\nThe call White pride\nThe Blacks got the muscle\nMexicans got the knives\nYou better be wise\nYou wanna stay alive\nGo toe to toe with a sucka\nNo matter wht size\nA fool tried to sweat me\nAct'n like he was hard\nI stuck him twice in the neck\nAnd left him dead in the yard\nIt was smooth how I did it\nCause nobody could see\nWith my jacket on my arm\nAnd my knife on the side of me\nBam bam, it was over\nAnother one bites the dust\nI went crazy in the pen\nWith nobody to trust\nBench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat\nUsed a tat gun, and engrved my set\nThey call me a lifer\nCause I'm good as dead\nI live in the hole, so the floor's my bed\nAnd I ask myself again\nWho has the power\nThe Whites? The Blacks?\nOr just the gun tower", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
