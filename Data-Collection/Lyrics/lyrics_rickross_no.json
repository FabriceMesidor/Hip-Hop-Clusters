Everywhere I go, that red A, that navy fitted\nOut in Florida representing... Collins to be specific\nLaFerrari or Bugatti, I ain\u2019t made enough to get it\nSo I\u2019m out here in my civic...\nAnd look at how I\u2019m walkin', you can tell that I be pimpin'\nI don\u2019t sell no drugs but I can get you a prescription\nCall my phone and I will listen for that work\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3dce21029cdd8aab73eb473e015807d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
