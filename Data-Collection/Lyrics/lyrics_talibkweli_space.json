It ain't got to be this way\nWe gon' take charge, make gods out of men\nWe gon' raise bars, show y'all how to win\nHit the rally, hit the riot, get the party started\nRespect the word, you herbs, it's the Kwelity artist\nWho solemnly promise my knowledge will demolish your college\nAnd minus your scholarship acknowledge the dollars\nAnd want me to payola, man I don't even know that broad\nI'm takin' over, keep it fresh like bakin' soda\nIn your fridge, I keep it Brooklyn like Jamaican soda, escovitch\nThat's how it is, and everything is everything\nTime to move on to better things\nKwelity, in the club is probably where Kweli be\nSteadily ignoring all the policies\nNo ID, rockin' shorts and tees\nVIP, puffin' all sorts of trees\nYou must mistake me for one of them soft emcees\nI ain't like the rest you often see, get off of me, yo\n\n[Outro]\nEverybody, gimme my space\nEverybody take four steps back\nSomebody gon' get hurt\nAll fun and games 'til someone lose an eye or something\nI ain't playin' with y'all\nEverybody in the house, back up, back up and gimme my space\nThere's enough room in here for everyone to eat\nEveryone to breathe, everyone to live\nWe can all get it if we get it together\nKnow what I mean, yo?\nCome on, gimme my space\nJust rock to this\nJust rock to that\nEverybody in the house, back up, back up and gimme my space\nCome on, just rock to this...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc343b697be2e7aba4e41bb9d26febdb.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
