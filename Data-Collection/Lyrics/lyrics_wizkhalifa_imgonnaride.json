I. T. T. S. B. U. R. G. H. represent to the fullest\nAnd I'm putting cowards back into place when I'm rapping the taste\nYeah crack in the place, laugh in your face\nLay up and chill after you safe that's a mistake\nCause I'm moving with a gang of ill guys looking like\nThe last of the day but why you say\nCause my nigga I could die today lock down\nAnd never see the light of day\nKidnapped trapped in a hide away\nSo I never get the cat to ride away fire inside of\nMay the kid move with da fools that try to take\nThe game back to the rhyming days payback\nFor the fact that your guys a fake and I can't even believe\nYou can spit shit to the people like it\nChips and just leaves you with kids, that leaves\nYou see through you pricks, hand my shit an overdose\nSo you wrote and sold some coke, move some crack\nHow true is that. Front on my cats and you'll lose shit back\nHaters get stacks when I'm through with rap\nAnd I'm filling my tracks with truth and fact\nKill em on wax and I'm moving cats\nWhen they crew in all black yeah I'm doing that\nI gotta flavor that will flow and taste\nAnd I'm doing it till I'm blue in the face\nI'm thinking bigger then any nigga that think\nHe cool in the place which gives me reason\nTo but a tool to his waist\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0cee9f06adc4b497759c94c781db2600.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
