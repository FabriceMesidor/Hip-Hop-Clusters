There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.\n\n[Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says \u201cthey\u2019re looting.\u201d If you see a white family, it says \u201cthey\u2019re looking for food.\u201d And you know, it\u2019s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I\u2019ve tried to turn away from the TV because it\u2019s too hard to watch. I\u2019ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I\u2019m calling my business manager right now to see what\u2019s\u2026 what is the biggest amount I can give and\u2026 and just to imagine if I was\u2026 if I was down there and those are\u2026 those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help. With\u2026 with the setup, the way America is set up to help the\u2026uh the uh, the poor, the\u2026 the black people, the uh\u2026 the less well-off as slow as possible. I mean, this is, Red Cross is doing everything they can. We\u2026 we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war, right now, fighting another way, and they\u2019ve\u2026 they\u2019ve given them permission to go down and shoot us.\n\n[Mike Myers]: And subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the lasting damage to the survivors\u2019 will to rebuild and remain in the area. The destruction of the spirit of the people of Southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all.\n\n[Kanye West]: George Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people.", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8b5f5a318cd4a4a8b25ed75c79526a22.452x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
