Think hard when you rollin your sack\nWhatever the case my Chi nigga, if it's in my means I got yo' back\nWhat the fuck's really goin on, does the magazine know we on?\nDon't he know I'm already established myself as Twista Corleone?\nWell I'm holdin my city down, ain't goin nowhere, here I stay\nYou know where I am if you hate me {\"Come and get me!\"}\nIf you want me {\"Come and get me!\"} Here I am\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Twista]\nWhat did I do to deserve, all of this madness around me\nFound me in the studio buryin myself in work and was smokin herb\nTried to kick me to the curb\nTo the back to the ditch to the dump to the shack but I sprint in the front\nIn the 'Llac with a fifth and a blunt in the back with a bitch and a pump\nAnd I'm ready to bust at you hoes, ready to dump lames in ditches\nSteady makin fakers bleed, L.B. family handle business\nComin into Twista's realm, journey with me through the pain\nThe hurt just might make you envision drama that could turn you insane\nHow much of my chaos bring tears, how many threaten my career?\nHow many threatenin to murder me but bitch you know where I live\nWho the fuck do you think I is? Y'all ain't comin at wit no shotties\nWhy you think you can hurt like these years, yo all of my peeps can you sawed\nThink you finna bring out my fears? Tell me why my success make you cry\nAnd why my downfalls make you laugh, but I bet my hydro got you high\nNever let hate back me down, stand firm like a man\nIf you want me {\"Come and get me!\"}\nWanna kill me? {\"Come and get me!\"} Here I am\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Twista]\nWe got Geo like Neo, of course we as sourcy as Morpheus\nOr we as sick as sir Marcus Aurelius alias atheist\nAgainst niggas who flow be the achiest, against the aliens\nAnd why they hate me is maybe it's cause I'm controllin this radius\nOf this world and this whole universe, don't believe let me spit you a verse\nJust when you thought you was worst, I come with words that'll make you disperse\nMy allies know I'm too cold, my enemies know I spit fast\nMy Lords know I bust that thang, my gangstas know I whoop some ass\nMobsta family steady ride, L.B. family steady click\nWhile us and other crews collide, choose your weapon take a pick\nLoad up, click-clack, it's on - finna bust, get back, run home\nCome at me bogus, get whacked with a strap to the back of the dome\nIndustry niggas get gone, heard y'all be speaking big words\nI show you some shit that'll blow you now slow you down like you sip syrup\nThe Chi-Town's sacrificial lamb, well here I stand\nFirm if you hate me {\"Come and get me!\"}\nIf you want me {\"Come and get me!\"} Here I am\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43a8d8ea9e82ab31d5a8dc1392088c6a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
