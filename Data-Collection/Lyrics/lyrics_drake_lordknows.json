Lord knows!\n\n[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]\nIt's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here\nAnd this girl right here, who knows what she knows?\nSo I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom\nAnd her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all\nBut that's just the result of me paying attention\nTo all these women that think like men with the same intentions\nTalking strippers and models that try to gain attention\nEven a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention\nBut Weezy and Stunna my only role models\nHaffa and Jordan my only role models\nThat's why I walk around with all this gold on\nAnd every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems\nBottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings\nAll of the little accents that make me a king\nI never hear the disses they try and point out to me\nBut it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing\nI'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August\nDo anything to buy gifts for they daughters\nGet some shake, a brick in the press\nAnd chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch\nI know it so well, I know the hustle so well\nStunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel\nDrug money outfit, record clean\nSpend it all on me and my fuckin' team\nMatchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (woo!)\nPlaces they say they've been, we actually going for real (woo!)\nI'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (woo!)\nI'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (woo!)\nMixtape legend, underground kings\nLookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (huh!)\nWith my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs\nYoung ass nigga, lifelong dreams\nThey take the greats from the past and compare us\nI wonder if they'd ever survive in this era\nIn a time where it's recreation\nTo pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations\nI know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at\nNever the flow though, they know I run that\nFuck you all, I claim that whenever\nI changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah\nYM, I remain that forever\nIn the same place my brother Wayne at forever\nI'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix\nI haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished\nI'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me\nI know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy\nKnow that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy\nSo those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me\nLord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up\nRoberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up\nA lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up\nBut if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?\nBought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky\nVery, very scary like shit you see in the movies\nIn this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy\nThat's why all the real soldiers salute me\nTrill nigga, for real\n\n[Interlude: Rick Ross]\nHuh! You know I love this\nYOLO, you only live once\nI'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie\nEvery day is another opportunity to reach that goal\n(M-M-Maybach Music)\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nI fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink (huh!)\nThe hustle's an art, I painted what I would think\nStill allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper\nDestined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (woo!)\nVilla on the water with the wonderful views (views)\nOnly fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)\nWent and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise\nAnd these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes\nIt's the red bottom boss (huh!), came to buy the bar (huh!)\nEvery bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (woo!)\nMurder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (woo!)\nHeadlights flicking, looking like a falling star\nEveryday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)\nI run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (running game)\nMink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (fornicate)\nRozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great (huh!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50b0608affc94c4dae3d502a65ea390.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
