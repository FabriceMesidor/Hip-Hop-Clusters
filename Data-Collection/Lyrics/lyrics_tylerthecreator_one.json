That's me\nI made that bitch my milk tits\nI was dressed up like Lisa Simpson\nPut her to sleep, quick in my hilton\nNow I'm bout to change your name to Ruth Wilson\nVoices in my head like kill them\nAmityville insanity pill\nI can't swallow my cavities\nThey're strictly from these casualties, that's really good with ham and cheese\nLoad them up on Craigslist\nMy email address is:\nHow-you-doing-my-name-is-Tyler, and you're a dead bitch\n(First)\n\n[Hook]\n(Aye, Aye, Aye,Aye)\nRun bitch, run!\n(Howl)\n(I'm a motherfuckin' wolf)\n\n[Outro]\nYou better run, bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/610384882ca6311db99de4fbfcdf2b46.421x421x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
