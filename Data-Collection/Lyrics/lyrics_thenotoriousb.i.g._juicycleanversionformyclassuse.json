Duh-ha, duh-ha\nYou never thought that hip hop would take it this far\nNow I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight\nTime to get paid, blow up like the World Trade\n\nBorn sinner, the opposite of a winner\nRemember when I used to eat sardines for dinner\nPeace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri\nFunkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky\n\nNow honies play me close like butter played toast\nFrom the Mississippi down to the East Coast\nCondos in Queens, indo for weeks\nSold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak\n\nLivin' life without fear\nPuttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear\nLunches, brunches, interviews by the pool\nConsidered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school\n\nStereotypes of a black male misunderstood\n\nWe used to fuss when the landlord dissed us\nNo heat, wonder why Christmas missed us\nBirthdays was the worst days\nNow we sip champagne when we thirsty\n\nDamn right I like the life I live\n'Cause I went from negative to positive\nAnd it's all, it's all good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/accf2df97375292b16f399ff6ec71e6e.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
