There's a nice hole in your forehead\nOr I'm cold cutting these niggas, like Boar's Head\nGuarantee whenever I spit it, you're gonna love it\nMy delivery is strictly offensive, just like the Nuggets\nAnd my gear is just as expensive as my luggage\nIf you try to shoot it high off the glass, I'm gonna rub it\nYou could whole brick, half of brick, ounce it, or dub it\nIt don't matter, 'cause whatever you want, I got it covered\nAnd they coming steady\nYou know we got them choppers\nAnd we like to dump 'em heavy\nOut the trunk of the Chevy\nSo if you get it how you live, nigga, buy 2\nHe ain't got it, they ain't got it, but I do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/34d1815281afeb502b98075367058136.453x453x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
