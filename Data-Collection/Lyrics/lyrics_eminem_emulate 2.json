Or my molecules just diabolical?\n'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley\nProbably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca\nI'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me\nI'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality\nI'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum\nElephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them\nI pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement\nI need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b4e4107970d86992883eef26d8c871a.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
