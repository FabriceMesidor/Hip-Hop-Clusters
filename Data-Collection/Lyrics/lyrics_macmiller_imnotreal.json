Test this\nThere's a few new rules in effect, bitch\nListen up, go\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nUgh, yeah\nSee this a rather spooky action movie, roll it up and pass it to me\nHash and booty, absolutely, smack a groupie acting bourgie\nSee a creature, ass beauty, need a feature, rather shoot me\nTruly bitches must have them bad jeans and back is Coogi\nHad to do these rapper tunes to let 'em know the trap is booming\nPast the views of Catholic schoolers, fact, but you in fact assuming\nBack to doing cash pursuing, posted up like Patrick Ewing\nRapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two\nThese eloquent irrelevant sentences show my penmanship\nIndefinite boundaries show you the end of it\nDon't forget you infested in nasty crevices\nAllowing birds to fall to their death before they even fly\nHe and I are not the same\nDoctor, doctor, please prescribe me something for the pain\nMoney in machines, those will make you change\nIf I go tomorrow, I just hope it ain't in vain, but I can't complain\n\n[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]\nPoint me to the road, and I'mma run it\nBloodhound with my nose to the money\nAin't fucking with these hoes (never that) getting ducats\n'Til I die, while my foes busy running, fuck it\nMarijuana smoke in my stomach, toasted in public\nHead in the clouds, when my toes in the struggle\nLike who didn't test yet?
