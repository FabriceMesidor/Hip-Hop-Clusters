are\nNot what you got on, what you can do for them\nIf you lucky enough to have some then\nYou know what I'm talkin bout\n\nVerse 1:\nFriends, how many of us have them\nAnd not that many\nThe chances of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny\nBut, it seems there really ain't a damn thing you can do\nCause since the seventies, it seems everybody been rolling with a crew\nA team, a gang, a posse, or some type-a click\nAnd if your firm ain't thick\nThen your squad becomes vixed\nBe extra careful or the ones you call your partna\nCause what they really is, is a busta out to rob ya\nAnd, be weary of strangers bearing your God and gifts\nAnd a wolf in sheeps clothing\nCause some of y'all ain't knowing\nMe and you go back like roaches in the projects\nAnd, we done been through things they still ain't even thought of yet\nA good homie is hard to come by\nBut most times you get done by the ones you trust most\nSo, I gotta raise a toast\nTo my tried and tested, and straight up for real dose\nPour yourself some exol, this ones here for you, loc\n\nChorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):\nI don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nUh, but, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nYou can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)\nThick and thin, nigga\nYou can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)\nIf I got a quarter, then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nAnd, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIf you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga\nYou can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)\n\nVerse 2:\nNow I done met a lot of haters in my lifetime\nThat I would of smoked if i would of had a Tek 9\nBut, here I stand as a man, and I'm free to say\nI'm hella glad that my momma didn't raise me that way\nAnd the homies I grew up with\nLocs I threw up with\nIs the kind of fools that you don't want to buck with\nWhy does it seem that the good brothers die\nAnd the evil brothers live\nAnd prosper and multiply\nPass the Hennessey to the left hand side\nWant some many dirt for the homies that expired\nI hope you rest in peace\nAnd, when it's time for my release\nI'll meet you at the crossroads dippin in the low-low\nBut, until then I'ma keep my rolls slow\nMy flow on tight, and stay rollin with the 4-0\nThis is comin from the one and only\nAnd like MC Shan said, \"I'll never leave you lonely\"\n\nChorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):\nI don't fly on air, walk on water (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nBut, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nYou can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)\nThick and thin, nigga\nYou can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)\nIf I got a quarter then you got a dime (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nAnd, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIf you watch my back, then I'll watch yours, nigga\nYou can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)\n\nVerse 3:\nMe and you is like family\nAnd everybody know that we go back to back\nAnd we go toe to toe\nComin from the west\nWhere the sets run thick\nWhere brothers either bang or try to make a grip\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nI never lie\nI run out on mine\nAnywhere or anytime\nMe and my homies don't get involved with that he say, she say\nBut, if you've lost you'll recieve a ass whippin with your instant replay\nOr, deckin like Tekken\nSo, show some respect when respect is given to you\nAnd, watch out for the forty too\nFake curve\nAnd fools who got the nerve\nTo pretend that they was down\nWhen last month they wadn't even around\nWest coast, East coast, and worldwide\nMy homies in the pen, and my homies that lived and died\nI'm still the same little nappy head brother from the eastside\nAnd, you can call me homeboy\n\nChorus, Coolio, (Montell Jordan):\nI don't fly on air or walk on water (Or walk on water, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nBut, I'm damn sure your partner (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nYou can count on me to the end (Oh-yeah)\nThick and thin, nigga\nYou can call me homeboy (You can call me homeboy)\nIf I got a quarter then you got a dime (If I got a quarter then you got a\nDime)\nAnd, you can call me up no matter what the time (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIf you watch my back, then I'll watch yours (Watch my back, then I'll watch\nYours, yours)\nYou can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)\nI don't fly on air, walk on water (Iiii, don't walk on water, no)\nYou can count on me till the end (Count on me till the end, oh-yeah)\nThick and thin (Thick and thin)\nYou can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)\nIf I got a quarter then you got a dime (If I got a quarter then you got a\nDime)\nAnd, you can call me up no matter what the time (Call me up no matter what\nThe time)\nIf you (If you)\n(Watch my back, I'll watch yours, yours)\nYou can call me homeboy (Call me homeboy)\n(You can call me homeboy, boy, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(I got your back, ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(You can call me homeboy)\n(You can call me homeboy)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b2afc0b2ec12b84597cab495ffdf0e1.600x600x1.jpg"}],
