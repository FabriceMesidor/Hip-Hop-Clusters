It's like funny\nI mack legit and make all the money\nSee my capital T on my diamond ring\nWe hook up the beat and love to swing\nSo while you're out there grooving back and forth\nI want you to scream out \"Sir Too $hort\" (Sir Too $hort!)\nDon't stop that rap (Don't stop that rap!)\nAnd it's just like that\nGet busy girls, while I rap\nI make big money, that ain't no crap\nWhen I grab that mic, and spit my rhyme\nI gotta have an 8 or 909 (BEAT)\nSo I can rock you all night long, (SHE'S)\nOn my tip, she love my song, (HE)\nTried to do it but did it wrong, (FREAKS)\nWant to get my all alone\nBut I'm macking\n\nHit it\n\nI finally got a chance to grab my pen\nAnd make another rhyme so I can make more ends\nIt's a rush production, not the beat\nI rushed it out the studio and hit the streets\nNow I'm rocking one more time\nYoung girls love my Too $hort rhyme\nBut that big fat girl better let that go\nBefore I point right at her say, (\"Ho!\")\nI'm riding drop-top Caddy, I don't dip fake\nI step on the gas then I hit the brake\nDo it again as I catch the beat\nYou're feeling that bass all down the street\nJumped out the car on 9-0\nI was wearing all white Capezio\nHad my 501's, five donkey ropes\nCouldn't be saved by John the Pope\nThe M-A-C and K, from Oakland, Californ-I-A\nI'm Too $hort baby, no I don't play\nI'm macking\n\nFreak nasty, I like your dance\nYou know it looks good in those pants\nSo damn good, I had to glance\nNow I'm macking\nSee this gold? I bought it all\nNow every night you young freaks call\nYou see my car? It's my best friend\nSo if you touch, you'll meet your end\nTime will tell, just keep it cool\nDon't play that game, don't be no fool\nI'll burn rubber all down your block\nYou know what I want so keep the door unlocked\nI'm coming in baby, don't waste no time\nIt's a mack attack, and now you're mine\nDangerous Music is what it seems\nThe reason this floor just met those jeans\nI was running the game all in your ear\nYou're talking bout love to a stone cold player\nGirl look good, wanna have that sex\nTook another look and wanted to break that neck\nIt's a mack attack, coming from way back\nMy name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack\nI'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I know it's true\nThe only thing you'll say about Playboy Too\nIs I'm macking", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cbe54aeda332def6155f0b3b28b1321.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
