Hello)\nOnly once the drugs are done (Hello)\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying (Get lifted)\nOnly once the drugs are done (Yeah, I get lifted)\n(Yeah, yeah, so get lifted, yeah)\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\n\n[Verse 1]\nI am sittin' on the clouds\nI got smoke coming from my seat\nI can play basketball with the moon\nI got the whole world at my feet\nPlayin' touch football on marijuana street\nOr, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleats\nGet high, so high that I feel like lying\nDown in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me\n'Cause (I feel like dying)\n\n[Hook]\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\n\n[Verse 2]\nSwimmin' laps around a bottle of Louis the XIII\nJumping off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine\nI'm at the top of the top, but, still I climb\nAnd if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine\nPop (pop), pop (pop)\nI feel like flying, then I feel like frying\nThen (I feel like dying)\n\n[Hook]\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\n\n[Verse 3]\nPsst! I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars\nI am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars\nI have just boarded a plane without a pilot\nAnd violets are blue, roses are red\nDaisies are yellow, the flowers are dead\nWish I could give you this feeling\nI feel like buying\nAnd if my dealer don't have no more\nThen (I feel like dying)\n\n[Hook]\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done\nDo I feel like dying, I feel like dying", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58abe7b35759cd5e876b36af76e0b072.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
