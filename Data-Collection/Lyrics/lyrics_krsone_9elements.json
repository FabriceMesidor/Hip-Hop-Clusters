No doubt\nHip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out\nIf you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop\nHoly integrated people have it, I'm the present power!\n\n[Hook]\nRap is something you do!\n3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*\nRap is something you do!\nHip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*\n\n[Kris]\nSkaters, BMX-bike riders rock\nDon't you ever stop! You are hip-hop\nYou doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs\nYou know you be packing that black block\nSelling that crackrock and ecstasy\nGettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me\nBut like I told those in the ghettoes\nHere's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that\nSome much more than rap, so much more than beats\nHip-hop is all about victory over the streets\nWhat you see on TV is a lie\nThat's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by\nBut, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?\nYou don't want the entertainment, you wanna be dead on the pavement\nWell, so be it, some of ya'll ain't gonna see it\nOthers wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!\n\n[Hook]\nRap is something you do!\n5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*\n\n\"Oh yea\" *scratched* --- From \"P is dead\"\n\n\"I have spent my whole life livin'\", \"talk to the fullest\", \"no doubt\"\n\n[Kris]\nYou know that's why these rappers can't hang\nCause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thing\nThey so careless, hip-hop is in awareness we give\nRap we do, hip-hop we live\nHow many times I gotta say it? How the radio ain't gonna play it\nAnd you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it\nThink about it! (think about it)\nThe present course of action, we have got to reroute it!\n\n[Hook: repeat 3X]\nHip-Hop is something you live!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2333a9607025ac4cc5a6777157dbce5f.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
