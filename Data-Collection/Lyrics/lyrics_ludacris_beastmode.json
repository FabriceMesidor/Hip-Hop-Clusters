Opponents, I laugh and be gone\nThey handin' in the towels like they work in Bed, Bath & Beyond\nBut in the midst of all the melee, y'all niggas just bitches with dicks like Sheneneh\nYour rap styles are phony, your lines are just dead\nAnd I be on them lines, like a nigga just played\nGuess I'm tryin' to say I'm advanced, you intermediate\nYou wouldn't know the real me, if your bitch Wikipedia'd it\nJust know that I never tried to be hard\nProbably cause Mr. Glock 40's my security guard\nYou'll get chopped like judo\nGangs in my hood make you reverse\nAnd change your color like the block's playin' Uno\nAnd, yes, some of my friends is still sellin' them drugs\nBut I just say they Weight Watchers like Jennifer Hud\nThey show me love\nThat's why I'll always stay reppin' until the death of me\nRappers talk shit, but ain't nobody ever stepped to me\nI hereby command all my fans' to inject it\nOverdose on Red Bull in your veins, if you ever slept on me\n(wake up)\nYeah, my mind is sharper than a guillotine\nAll the nines extended, from the knuckles of Wolverine\nNot a X-Man, but, man, I got that X\nSome of my artists switch labels, but I still get a check\nThe more albums they sell, the more we all win\nAnd I can be seen in thirty rocks like Alec Baldwin\nOr watchin' CBS in a Cadillac DTS\nI plan to reach the world, man, your plan is MetroPCS\n(can you hear me now)\nI changed my music up cause I was gettin' bored\nYou may not like the way I shoot, but my points go on the board\nMy name still engrained and these books will be the outcome\nAnd this one verse is harder than a lot of niggas' albums\n\n[Outro]\nPeace, fuck out of here, rewind that shit\nHa-ha-ha, Luda, ain't shit changed", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/bb65af38cd63499ff8d0dd614d0ef3ae.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
