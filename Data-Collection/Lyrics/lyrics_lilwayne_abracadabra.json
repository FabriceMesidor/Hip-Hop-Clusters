Yeah, look\nI'ma tell you all this last time, don't get involved\nBullets start ripping through the walls\nHit ya baby mama and the house door\nWe making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward\nKnock your ass out if you talk stupid\nGot a big dick so I walk stupid\nShe got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty\nHold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away\nBut all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way\nToo many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays\nI'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades\nSipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate\nGot the Jones soda with the drink in it\nGot a backwood with the dank in it\nParty ain't popping if we ain't in it\nGo Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em\nThat's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are\nThey treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am\nI got your bitch but that's my bitch\nSo that's our bitch and that's all cool\nWhen you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through\nAnd that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews\nVroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do\nPast cool, young Jones\n\n[Verse 2: Euro]\nMy enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee\nI know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly\nMy closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses\nLook, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers\nDon't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it\nThey wrap the body, then rap about it\nSink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it\nFuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it\nIf a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit\nSwerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em\nMy bad, I'm turning my back on 'em\nI fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em\nReal shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em\nTrill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em\nI ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there\nI'm in the club but I'm in the cut\nThey got cameras here like Oprah's here\nSince a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear\nSo I had to \"abracadabra,\" \"voila,\" just to make hope appear\nYoung!\n\n[Bridge: Lil Wayne]\nAbracadabra, abracadabra!\nWe rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened\nCopperfield, I just popped a seal\nYou don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real\nVoila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!\nTold momma, nana, I'm doing my count\nDon't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out\nVoila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!\nMama, nana, I'm doing my count\nDon't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila!\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nMagic dust, yeah that's a rush\nGot her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun\nI'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre\nI'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica\nSatanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar\nI leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou\nImpractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole\nWe back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore\nThat magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water\nI met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook\nI'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave\nI walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face\nI pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell\nDisappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there\nSmoking roadkill, she on coke here\nStash is sticking to her nosehair\nI'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale\nHold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter\nWe rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar\nHammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos\nShoot up the cameras, die in pajamas\nFind you with Sam and your wife and your mamas\nAll in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!\n\n[Bridge: Lil Wayne]\nAbracadabra, abracadabra!\nWe rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened\nCopperfield, I just popped a seal\nYou don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real\nVoila!

Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3622689a5172c789024942436b11dce2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
