It hurt me inside\nI feel guilty walking around outside with false pride\nIf only we could vibe like, one more time\nHear one more line or share one more rhyme\nEven show me one more sign of destiny itself would be fine\nBut there's no turning back the, hands of time\nOr delayin' the plans of your mastermind\nSo I hope you came across of what you had to find\nAnd watch over the ones you once loved\nYou was my nigga when push came to shove\n\n[Outro]\nOne love, one love, one love, one love\nThe sky's the limit\nThat's what they told the fuckin' fool\nI disguised the limit\nNow I'm aiming for the sun and moon\nNow I'm aiming for the sun and moon\nLong Live Steelo\nYo y-yo\nY-yo yo yo\n93 'til infinity, King Capital\nMay your soul Rest in Peace", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccc6b3e099d7f0a3416209e4a5d67fd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
