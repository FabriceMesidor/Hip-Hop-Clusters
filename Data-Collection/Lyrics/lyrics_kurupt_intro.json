Then tell your local promoter\nThis Gotti!\n\n[Outro: Terrace Martin]\nWhat's happening, y'all? It's Terrence Martin and Kurupt\nWell actually, it's Kurupt and Terrence Martin\nSo, I guess they call these things...\nThese first presentations on an album the intro\nI\u2019m gonna call it the beginning of the moment of truth, ya dig?\n'Cause the truth will set you free\nAnd Streetlights will set you free too\nDon't run from it...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48a18f242c2b2fb8c91b44110a454db4.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kurupt"}
