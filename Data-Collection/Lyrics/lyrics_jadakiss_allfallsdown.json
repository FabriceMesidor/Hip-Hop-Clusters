Cross]\nOne thing y'all know about me\nI don't play, so just beware\nYou catch me up in V.I.P\nUp in the club, that's my atmosphere\nBecause I got money to spend -- I keep getting it in\nFrom the hood, so I don't play fair\nAnd I'mma keep living it up, keep getting it up\nKeep throwing it up until it all falls down\n\n[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]\nBreak the P's down to onions, money in abundance\nI'm in the lower millions, I'm trying to get in the hundreds\nNiggas' pants too tight to fight, so they don't want it\nYou pay for somebody to protect you, so where your gun at?\nBeen there, done that; seen the coke come back\nSeen niggas come home from jail, then run back\nSinging the same sad song, my nigga -- one that\nNegative energy stick to him like a thumbtack\nReal hustler, probably sold a million and one packs\nNiggas think they smart and nice, but they dumb wack\nIt's only 'til you crack they skull, give them a mum' wrap\nWhen it's cold, I reside wherever the sun's at\nSon's back, what?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nTop of the league, 3-piece suit or fatigues\nAll I got to do is look a certain way and you'll bleed\n4 words describe me: \"Niggas can't fuck around\"\nFish scale verses: prices go up and down\nPut it out there, see if it taste right\nYoung Jewish bulldog keeping the case right\nApartment on the 4th floor, keeping the base right\nJacksons and Benjamins keeping the safe right\nFirst and the 15th is when we break nights\nBunch of red beams on your head like brake lights\nBitches that fucked everybody turned into fake dykes\nWas biting the whole day -- it's gonna be a great night\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDice hitting the wall, decks getting shuffled\nNines getting wiped down, Tecs getting muffled\nPerico in the plastic stacks in the duffel\nNiggas coming through getting racks on the muscle\nYou asked me for money, I ain't ask you to hustle\nThe industry is hurt, they looking for the next Russell\nThe hip-hop cops outside waiting to cuff you\nThe Bloods is on Rikers Island waiting to cut you\nNiggas on the outside just want to abduct you\nDudes turned they back on you that you look up to\nKeep throwing mine in the air, I got enough to\nAnd I don't like spending my money, nigga...I love to", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b41d24971c1b4f84030e2cf59cb5061e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
