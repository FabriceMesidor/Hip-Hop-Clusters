I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost\n'Cause all the dead rapper's albums are sellin' the most\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nIn this heartless world that I live in\nI have learned that I can't depend on love\nIt hasn't made me a cent\nSo I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard\n(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nSome say the third verse puts niggas in the hearse\nSince I was born Jay, guess I'm The Gift & The Curse\nLot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first\nSpill blood out here that's why I'm up in the church\nStill repenting for my sins, but not all the way\nCause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K\nWhat he 'gon do with it? Prolly 'gon run up on your crew with it\nThat's what I call rap beef, lucky I'm through with it\nNow I just lean back, '72 with it\nSell it to a nigga down south, he act a fool with it\nBack to them haters and them stool pigeons\nYou too busy tryna judge us stars, but how are you livin'?\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nIn this heartless world that I live in\nI have learned that I can't depend on love\nIt hasn't made me a cent\nSo I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard\n(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7e8ae0f47986bad415f5d58fc0b2281.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
