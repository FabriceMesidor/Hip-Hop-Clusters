To the getaway car\nAnd now my drivin' skills gotta be up to par\nThe cops parked the car and sprayed till it was smoked up\nThat's when I woke up\n\n[Hook: Piano hook]\n\n[Jungle]\nYea Nas, nigga\nWord Life Kid\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nThe whole thing was a nightmare\nI fell asleep watchin' Scarface, layin' in the chair\nStandin' on the block, it was flooded with cops\nThrough the parks was the D's and the Narcs\nWatchin' me walkin' out my buildin\nStarin' and hawkin shit, but I as fortunate\nI usually be goin' out with the 9\nInstead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime ...\n... Bag of weed, never cracks, I ain't with that\nI bought Buddha, some Phillies and a Kit-Kat\nNow I'm walkin' back, through the drug infested area\nWhich was filled with hysteria\nWhen a cop yelled, \"Come here, black.\"\nI thought to myself, \"What part of the game is that?\"\nI didn't do no crime for you to be wastin' your time\nWith your antagonistic mind\nHe said that I was bein' smart and I better run\nHe looked like a Klans-man with a gun\nSo, I started floatin'\nPolice in Queensbridge, they don't be jokin'\nI ran up my crib, in the nick of time\nRolled up a Philly and stashed the 9\nPolice later left, I was outta breath and what not\nSomebody got shot, that why it's hot\nI called my man and told him the adventure\nAnd later, I meet him at the community center\nI need a six pack of Beck's\nIt's Just Another Day in the Projects!\n\n[Hook: Piano Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d5180486c5864bcc94ba79789630f59.268x268x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
