This sure hit alone'll bury ya\nAnd even if I got deported, I own America\n\n[Slick Rick]\nHe's so crazy -- I smash rippin up the place\nGive the mack a taste -- I wipe my ass with a rapper face\nCars come to a dead stop\nRain find ways not to drop on my headtop\nTycoon rush at the richest\nEven my complexion is a must-have to bitches\nEven without, car money to budget\nI would have the most elegant apartment in the projects\nKnahmean?  Bitches are in awe * at the lingo\t\t* (pronounced OAR)\nKnow that Rick'll put an end to all rapper income\nAn old-timer, lock up all vagina fills\nFrance nor Italy can fuck with my designer skills\nSaltin inferior, faultin to where we are\nTryin to find fault in superior\nLet me slow it down, that's enough of that\nThis I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats\n\nChorus\n\n[Slick Rick]\nYou lack the taste hook I'm stickin em with\nWhile degenrate like yourself make our race look ignorant (mm)\nAnd your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy\nBout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin\nFeet planted on deep black firmament\nBow -- in the presence of who lead rap permanent\nLike a lion rap rips a chunk of kids\nYou stunk, cause mortals ain't shit to conquer\nSomebody said new pharoahes have appeared\nHow when everything I wore ten years ago you wear now?\nI coulda murder heard a word out quick Rick stomp it kid\nHung to it, you complete bum to Rick\nSource Awards, yeah Rick every seminar\nEven make Sadaam Hussein tell me where the weapon are (mm-hmm)\nLet me slow it down, that's enough of that\nThis I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats\n\nChorus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73539fff4e6ebc470e6cab73853f0ac6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
