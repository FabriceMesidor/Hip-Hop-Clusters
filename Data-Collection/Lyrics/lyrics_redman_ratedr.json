That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill\nFrom a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill\nJust because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit\nWhat's the flavor, Tame? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)\n\n[Chorus: Repeat 4X]\n\"I'm rated R, this is a warning\" --> Rakim\n\"Boy you can't fuck with me!!\" --> Ice Cube\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack to part two of the segment, the Red bend\nMics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends\nAnd if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk\nAnd tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)\nGot Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P\nThe best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!\nPsych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women\n'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin\nI grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip\n(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)\nI had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck\nTried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)\nSnapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it\n'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)\nJason my man slangs rocks like up the block\n143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop\nNorman Bates work the night shift late\nSince he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake\nBust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger\nDreamed about me havin' him scooped up\nHe woke up with his dukes up\nThat caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw\nPlus I got his brain pickled in a jar\nSo let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate\nMy rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate\nAnd rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up\nWith the one-two punch, like serving a customer\nAnd if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him\nThen ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from\nI know, from me, THE original P-Funk\nSee ya next LP, chump!\n\n[Chorus: Repeat 4X]\n\"I'm rated R, this is a warning\" --> Rakim\n\"Boy you can't fuck with me!!\" --> Ice Cube", "image": "https://images.genius.com/851b0a63d63f6c8548a17f295b615296.1000x991x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
