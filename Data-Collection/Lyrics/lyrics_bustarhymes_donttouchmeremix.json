Flip mode. Aftermath. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nReal talk word to mother it be the gutter brother (ah!)\nBack with another banger to set off the summer (huh!)\nBetter get up and come a-round\nCause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet\nYou probably should call the plumber\nYou niggas get dumb and dumber\nThinkin you can come around and test me\nLike these other niggas, well, pick a number\nI''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga\nGet it together, been bodyin shit since mommy named me Trevor\nStellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a\nReaction I attract all the people to come together\nWhether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter\nJust let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that\nWhen I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in\nRemember I'm too hot to touch kid\nCurious, my fire burnin niggas serious\nI gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is\nSee through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal\nI'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)\nI be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest\nAnd kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)\nFront if you want but you know who the top biller\nBounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 2: Reek Da Villian]\nR-double E-K, D-A Villian\nI'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face\nWhen the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo\nRob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo\nBet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue\nOf a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)\nTurn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero\nWhen my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)\n\n[Verse 3: Spliff Star]\nI'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon\nMy goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em\nDead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim\nWith fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em\nNow I got pretty women all around the world\nIf I been in your city probably pound your girl\nHad her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out\nSend her back home set to fire the sex out\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 4: The Game]\nMotherfucker, it's FLIPMODE, when I come up in the club\nThrowin up a dub, liftin up a snub\nFlipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are\nUsed to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar\nEatin on supreme shit, at the round table\nOn some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge\nI talk reckless, the whole world know\nMy style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW\nSo don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs\nAnd come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids\nLike, \"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\n\"Shh, take off the watch\"\nThey said Game in the club with a big ass Glock\nLike boom, guess who stepped in the room\nLAX comin' through JFK real soon\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]\nJump on the track like Michael Jeffrey\nEven the referee say I need an ESPY\nAward just applaud I'm a boar with a broad\nI go hard and my leather so soft and I cough\nAnd the board of health say the boy need help\nI am so hot the AM just melt\nAll aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud\nI'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod\nI'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur\nI'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold\nI'm raw than a temperature rose to five and\nTwo o's that's 500 degrees for those who know\nMy fire's higher than a liars\nWe don't burn rubber, we burn tires\nWe riders, residers, we live in The Carter\nWayne is a flame that could live in the water\nOk now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate\nEither way you on my plate gettin ate after grace\nIf you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner\nI'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners\nI swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture\nBoy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man\nHotter than the Peter pan to a wet bare hand\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 6: Nas]\nMan, listen I spot a square dude from a distance\nThrough the tinted Maybach curtain in partition\nNip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em\nOr pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em\nBring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire\nYou ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler\nCrutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver\nKeep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider\nI ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder\nI used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper\nNo black leather jackets or black berets\nSince my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page\nAnd none of y'all cop what I cop\nForget your excuse if the music ain't hot\nWhere the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes\nSee you on the club, wrist never on froze\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go\n\n[Verse 7: Big Daddy Kane]\nBusta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through\nThis is routine kid it ain't nothin new\nYou bring trouble to me, the untouchable\nMake me have to bring in the troops like George W\nI'll scorch you somethin awful when I fall through\nOf course the raw to be when you could put a broad to\nBetter bring with you your fire extinguisher\nListen, I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya (OK!)\nKid I made it from magazine pages to big stages\nHigh wages through all of the different ages\nThinkin you do it like this is outrageous\nYeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous\nYour hottest thing to me, not a thing\nEvery night my crib is like the Bada Bing\nSo make sure that you youngin's got it right\nKane's who's the fuckin rockstars party like, you heard?\n\n[Hook: Busta Rhymes]\nSo don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nDon't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nWe got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)\nHere we go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54314abfbbbf16253d72455428cc44e6.834x834x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
