Around nine, nah, six, seven\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe ended up on the block with kid scooters and ice cream\nBut in and out of foster homes, until he was 19\nStealing for food and didn't do for enjoyment\nAt the time of lay off, shut down and unemployment\nHe moved into a new world, to seek his fortune\nAnd suited himself to the times with extortions\nA hustle that was ruled by men and murder\nHe earned enough for his daily bread and wanted to move further\nHe knew no good, could come from such a sin\nHad issues as a kid, so he held it all within\nAnd he pursued the game so hotly, on a path of destruction\nEven though the road was rocky\nVery caught up in his own drive for dominance\nAnd to know that he would pay in the end was common sense\nSome say he had a long deserved death\nAnd then he felt relieved when they were told he left\n\n[Interlude: sample (GZA)]\nThese young civilians move to an assault and battery\nPlus, mortal techniques, breaking and entering, burglary\nPurse snatching (on the path of destruction)\nShoplifting, hand graffiti, crash and stolen property\nPossessing and distribution of narcotics\nIllegal possession of weapon, assaulting a police officer\nLarceny (on the path of destruction)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aec3826e892d3ad57deb62e63fed42c5.940x940x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
