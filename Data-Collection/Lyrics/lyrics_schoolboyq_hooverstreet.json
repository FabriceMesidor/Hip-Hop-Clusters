Last night it was a dream\nThis morning a fantasy back when the only fan I had was a fiend\n(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)\nMeet me by the Acura, cause the cops like\nTo get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea\nBut it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula\nSee I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'\nThen rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo\nThe bad guy, never once been a ho's hero\nHe get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\n\n[Beat Change]\n\n[Hook]\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\n[Bridge]\nBut... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga\nBut... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)\nBut... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\n[Verse 2]\nFind a nigga realer than me, my socks stink (yeah)\nEat so much pussy that my mustache pink\nStrapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help\nHoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out\nMy hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep\nI never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame\nOrange-yellow higher than Margielas, since a young nigga\nI admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal\nFrom his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout\nThink about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday\nHe still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick\nSell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips\nCause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much\nTo get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work\nUnless we rewind, and answer my church\nTimes getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt\nAround the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck\nFreeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and\nCheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I\nLeave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well\nAnd my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\n[Hook]\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\n[Bridge]\nBut... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga\nBut... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)\nBut... Meet Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGrandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more\nShe always got me things, that we couldn't afford\nThe new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers\nSega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war\nWe wasn't thinking of getting money then\nNor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz\nCause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down\nI also notice moms be locking doors, when he around\nBut anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us\nMy bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month\nMy uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups\nKnocking on the door telling me to \"Hurry up!\", he in a rush\nI gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it\nMoms used to tell me like, \"Nigga, know who you dealing with.\"\nThem was the good days ,'til I was raised the older ways\nRat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K\nI was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back\nHe called us over like - HEY!\nYAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -\"Daaaaaamn, nigga\"\nThen again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, \"Daaaaaamn, nigga!\"\nHearing him say \"Cuz'\", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!\nLater on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades\nContinue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page\nGangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help\nShe should've never left her gun on the shelf\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\n[Hook]\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\n\n[Bridge]\nBut...
