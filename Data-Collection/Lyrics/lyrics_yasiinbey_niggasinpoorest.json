Little Maurice in the sixth grade\nNo mama, no father, role model the dope game, say\nPoor so hard, bitch behave, standing behind the deuce-deuce-trey\nIce-cold, heat blow, closed casket, cold case\n\n[Hook]\nPoor so hard, that shit cray\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese young bloods is looking scary at the mall\nThey wearing pants, you can still see they drawers\nThey rob a nigga in the bathroom stall\nThey took his life cause he ain't want to take it off\nPoor so hard, that shit cray, ain't it, Bey?
