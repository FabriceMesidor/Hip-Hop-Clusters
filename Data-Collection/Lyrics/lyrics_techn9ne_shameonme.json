I want you to come over\nI left the door unlocked, and... oh my god\"\n\n[Hook]\nIt doesn't have to mean anything (x3)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHurt me once then I'm an idiot if I stay\nCause I'm hoping that twice that ain't no kinda game that I play\nHer knife was jagged but now I have it my way\nI just grabbed it without feelin I stabbed it pipe-lay\nYeah shallow, but I'm hurt-free now though\nBeen suffering silently for so long this is my growl\nNow they sayin I don't feel enough\nCause I don't wanna be wonderin if it's real or what\nBroke up with me once, I came right back like a dunce\nBut then the second was funk, now I'mma be really blunt\nThat really stirred N9ne\nWe lovers in her mind\nBroke up with me twice and you don't get a fucking third time\n\n[Bridge]\nListen to me... you don't have to spend the night\nYou can just come over for a little while\nI'm not gonna tell anybody, I swear to god\n\n[Hook]\nIt doesn't have to mean anything (x6)\n\nOh my god... you look so younger than earlier\nAnd I can still smell you on me\nI just wanna taste you, just for tonight\nIt doesn't have to mean anything (x6)", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/T9EPTHRPY_500.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
