Lewis]\nIt\u2019s all illusions, fixed gear cruising\nFixed reality shrouded from governmental pollution\nI ain\u2019t a saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it\nIt\u2019s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching\nI ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish\nCause I notice I\u2019m slowly becoming way more imbalanced\nA king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice\nSolid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon\nHas told many tales, his flows you could sells\nMastering wind elements, I move with the gales\n\n[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable\nI\u2019m boxing yo dorm, Put my Nikes on the coffee table\nMy tongue\u2019s below her navel, she makes it where her skills in naval\nSeals my hands on her extremities, we\u2019re chopping up these remedies\nCame in between her and I\nWe leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?\nI think not cause all I do is smoke pot\nAnd make beats, and yo ass just want back shots\n\n[Verse 3: Dirty Sanchez]\nSmoker\u2019s club, Michael Jordan how I\u2019m killing 4 quarters\nYou stashing the trash, hoarder\nYo girl starting to bath water, it\u2019s Dirty\nAnd that\u2019s not an introduction, it\u2019s nutching\nDirt on my shoulders, like Hova\nMy niggas turn boulders soft, that\u2019s the shit that me and jovid saw uh\nAnd now its like Pro Era in stores\nAll my niggas opening doors,\nAll my bitches is braless, flawless more or less\nBalance was the key, more action less speaking\nEverybody wants a piece\nPeace\n\nCheck\n(Peace)\nYo\n\n[Verse 4: A la $ole]\nWhen I release the flows I goes over yo dome far\nThe nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars\nI shine further, you sons get in the bogart\nYou gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God\nBetter with the regis my mind, they manifesting\nBeast coast, yea we the pros, you don\u2019t wanna mess with\nWe leave you breathless, don\u2019t second guess the best who blessed it\nLess than yo adolescence when I speak my progression\n\nBring it down baby\nBring it down baby, uh\n\n[Verse 5: Kirk Knight]\nThis is what I asked for, asked for\nChilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts\nConfuse my intelligence, maybe I\u2019m irrelevant\nSo eloquent, being riders with a elephant\nThe higher rank tryna pull a trump card\nWhen I try and do the things, I deserve all respect\nIntricit my amount, boy to any amount\nTo any account, probably I gets em out uh\n\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI must admit, I must admit\n\n[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]\nThe mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great\nFollowing schedules, never scheduled for break\nBut still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace\nRegular days went to getting paid regular\nRespecting the Era where the Era\u2019s been ascending up\nGot all types of fans that\u2019s always sending us love\nAnd ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove\nAnd stayed deeper but still heading above\n\u2018Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above\nRegular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height\nCause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights\nCame with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes\n\nBring it down baby\nBring it down baby, uh\n\n[Verse 7: CJ Fly]\nLooking for who\u2019s in charge, don\u2019t be shocked, I\u2019m the plug\nGet inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant\nEnergy \u2013 I put all in\nI\u2019m learning the flaw things\nIn the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up\nI know how to conduct, feelings electric\nWell we\u2019re connected, your buttons are pressing\nCan test the reception, I sent you a message\nLet me know if you get this, the question\n\n[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]\nSeen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps\nLike it\u2019s \u201993 still, got \u201993 til mic skills\nEven got the ecko check\nLike for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions\nMy professions are not no seconds\nTo no veterans and they minutes of fame\nI\u2019m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame\nMake it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain\nGot my head up in my dreams\nEverything ain't what it be seemin'\nDon\u2019t blame me girl, blame my semen\nYou got good jeans so your inseams made seamless\nAnd off top, you\u2019re ingenious\nWe took a hit of of the greenest\nNow she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us\nBreak her body down to the genus if she leaving\nShe didn\u2019t get the pic and now I see Sophia\nShe get the tone, sorry Bonita but\nSophia got a applebum\nSophia got a applebum\nI\u2019m thinking I should take it home\nWhat you saying?\n\n[Outro]\nWho do you think Bonita Applebum is?\nI think Bonita Applebum is...\nHold on before you even talk, you ever been with a Bada$$ nigga?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccc6b3e099d7f0a3416209e4a5d67fd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
