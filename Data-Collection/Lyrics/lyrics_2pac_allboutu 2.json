Hahaha (Yeah)\nIt's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)\nHaha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house\nWith my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)\nIt's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you\nBut you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nYou probably crooked as the last trick\nWant to laugh 'bout how I got my ass\nCaught up with this bad bitch?\nThinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run\nIt's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one\nWise decisions, based on lies we livin'\nScandalous times, this game's like my religion\nYou could be rollin' with a thug\nInstead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love\nIn every club, I see you starin' like you want it\nWell, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it\nLet the liquor help you get up on it\nI'm still tipsy from last night\nBumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life\nI try to holla, but you tell me you taken\nSayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'\nGuess it's true what they tellin' me\nFresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity\nSo that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it\nFantasies of us kissin', can I hit it?\nAddicted to the things you do\nBut still true what I'm sayin', boo, \u2018cause this is all about you\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\nYeah, nigga\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nI make a promise if you go with me, just let me know\nI'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave\nNobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga\nI only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers\nI love niggas \u2018cause we comin' from the same place\nWitness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes\nHow can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?\nCreep low, weed smoke's in the air\nEverywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes\nWaitin' for niggas at the end of every show\nI just seen you in my friend's video\nCould never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go\nFollow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through\nIt's all about you\nYeah, nigga, it's all about you\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\n\n[Verse 3: Hussein Fatal]\nIs you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?\nIt ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew\nEvery other city we go and every video\nExplain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?\nYou think it's all about you? Well, boo\nI gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too\n\n[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]\nYou couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track\nA lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff\nWhen I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll\nStraight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll\nHold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next\nGold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex\n\n[Verse 5: Hussein Fatal]\nI slide in easily, try a grizzly\nSluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me\nRunnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya\nAt the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia\n(It's all about you)\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho\n\n[Outro: Snoop Doggy Dogg]\nI'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit\nI mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video\nI see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video\nThen I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video\nI see the same bitch that was in my video\nYou know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?\nWhat make that even more fucked up\nI'm watchin' a Million Man March\nAnd I see the same bitch on the Million Man March\nThat was in the homeboy Warren G video!\nI mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go\nI see the same ho\nDon't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0e663efef180da9b5d259005a1919e3.589x589x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
