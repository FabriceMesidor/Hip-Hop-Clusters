Burning up out\nIt took more, than firemen, to put that out\nAnd yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock\nThat I can hit a home run, with my cock\nShe said, \"Let me show you what we do uptown\nI huff and I puff till I blow your balls down\"\nWild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave\nShe said, \"My what a great big ahhh! you have\"\nI started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms\nI know we must save water but that does not include sperm\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch\nFrom a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch\nWhile she's loving part time, she's riding on mine\nShe says, \"I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!\"\nIn her behind, vagina, or heated climax\nThat I would sew, control, finger then wax\nNow she's swingin so low yo she flex like wrecks\nCuz she can set records on oral sex\nThere's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed\nIf she got married, she'd be a worn out newlywed\nAnd if she heard these words yo she would not cry\nBecause sperm, the only damn tears in her eye\nHer drip-drop face is the one I painted\nJust stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted\nAs she choked, goggled, then spit up\n'Cause cream, was flowing, all over her cup\nOn the bathroom floor 'cause her parents were home\nAnd I just couldn't tolerate her moans and groans\n\"Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard!\n'Cause I don't want to stop, I love you God!\"\nBut there's one thing she could never erase\nThat the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face\nSo she regret, she ever swung low before\nBut this little hot bitch comes swinging for more\nIt used to be one, now it's five fingers of death\nThat rips her insides, as she gasp for breath\nTo say, \"I love you! I love you! Forever so!\nI'm getting hot getting hot let me blow let me blow\"\nWhat she thought was love, turned out to be lust\nThat made her live by the laws, in sex we trust", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
