What you headed towards?\nWhat's your name worth when they mention yours?\nWhen you leave here, are you stepping forward?\nCan you remember your intention when they question yours?\nThey're gonna question yours, they're gonna question yours\nI've been to rock bottom and I'm headed North\nIf you don't love yourself, what's the respect for?\nIf you don't love life, the check won't correct yours\nExcavate\n\n[Chorus: Saint Claire]\nFill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away\nCrack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain\nAnd I found peace\nAnd I found peace\nAnd I found peace\n\n[Verse 2: Macklemore]\nI had this vision of my death\nSurrounded by people I love and respect\nIn the baby blue Cadillac hearse\nPullin' me 'round the block that I rep\nThe greatest fear that I've ever kept\nIs dying with regrets\nLike was I just alive for success?\nOr did I leave a better life for the rest?\nMy greatest achievement isn't the dollars\nMy greatest achievement isn't the followers\nMy greatest achievement isn't the accolades\nMy greatest achievement is my daughter\nWakin' up in the morning, bein' a father\nWatchin' the light kiss her eyelids\nHearin' her sing along to Chance\nAnd bein' like, \"Yeah, that's my kid\"\nThe light started to glow\nAnd the saxophone from Coltrane started to blow\nTender, laying in the snow, turn on my headphones\nCouple miles to go before I run out of road\nExcavate\n\n[Chorus: Saint Claire]\nFill my lungs up, pour my heart out, peel my bones away\nCrack my window, shed my shadow, excavate my pain\nAnd I found peace\nAnd I found peace\nAnd I found peace\n\n[Outro: Macklemore]\nHold me up into the light and study every part of me\nI'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read\nJust flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave\nBut who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?\nHold me up into the light and study every part of me\nI'm an open book, no, I don't mind, but sometimes I'm hard to read\nJust flesh and bone, I'm headed home, but this life is so hard to leave\nBut who am I when they cut the lights and nobody's watching me?\nGemini", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ea668c903da567bb7c9de7dda4c7b81.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
