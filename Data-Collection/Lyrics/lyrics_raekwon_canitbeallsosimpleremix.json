What the fuck, yo?\nWe taking you on another chamber\nWord up, son, you know how we be on it\nYeah, it's real\nShow these crabs how to rhyme man\nI think it's time to bless them, word up\nBulletproof\nFirst chamber\nYo, Chef, yo\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nIt started off on the Island aka Shaolin niggas wilding\nOld folks scream stop the violence!\nTrue. laying up yo, watching these crack niggas\nPlaying nuff crap games for what, see\nBack in days, crime pays in mad ways\nSporting Tommy Hil with caves, 360 waves\nAnd no searching for loose ends, now I flex 300 Benz\nMad Timbs with mad diamonds\nNow that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggas act trife\nI paid the price throughout my hood life\nRemember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid\nGod forbid I lay in the casket\nBut now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke\nI wash my mouth out with soap\nAnd got my act together, Lo sweaters and better\nAnd phat leathers, so whatever, bring it on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e336a632db4d1dd7b6d848646b5d5ffc.876x876x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
