EMINEM\n\nI'll sh*t on you\nDa dada da\nI'll sh*t on you\nDa dada da\nI'll sh*t on you\nDa dada da\nI'll sh*t on you\nDa dada da\nI'll sh*t on you\nI will sh*t on you\nI'll sh*t on you\nGirl you

wantin' me\nThe national guard\nThey scared of huntin' me\nI love beef\nI got your h*e duckin' me\nA drug thief\nB**** I'll take your marijuana\nThese slugs will keep\nYour as* away from my corner\nI drown niggas\nIn hundred degree saunas\nYou can act if fool\nIf you wanna b****\nIt's this lyrical piranha\nStrapped with a grenade\nIn a pool with yo' mama\nAttack her by the legs and\nPull her to the bottom\nTwit lettin' up like a condom\nSlappin' if you f***ers got a problem\nWhen I see 'em\nYou h*es endin' up\nIn a f***in' mausoleum\nOr hidden in a trunk\nOf a black and gold BM\nPull in a garage\nWhile you screamin'\nKeep the motor on\nAnd I'm leavin'\nI'll sh*t on you\n\nCHORUS:\n(Eminem:)\nI will sh*t on you\nI don't care\nWho you are\nI'll sh*t on you\nI don't give a f***\nA-bout

alcholic\nWhere's the f***in' toilet\nPass the hot dog\n(Bizarre, aren't you Islamic?)\nB**** shut your f***in' mouth\nI'ma keep eating 'till\nRichard Simmonds comes to my house\nWith a chainsaw to cut me out\n(My house, my house)\nAw f*** your wife\nI had sex since I met her\nToo busy f***in' with\nYour baby sitter (ha ha ha)\nAnd all women ain't sh*t\nOnly good for cooking\nCleaning and sucking d*ck\nAnd that's it\n(I said it)\nI'm responsible for killing John Candy\nGot JonBennet Ramsey\nIn my '98 Camry (she's lost)\nI don't give a f***\nWho you are\nI'll sh*t on anybody\nTruly yours\nThe Idoitic Bizarre\n\n(Eminem:)\nMy adolescent years weren't sh*t\nTo wait I do know\nI never grew up\nI was born grown and grew down\nThe older I get\nThe dumber the sh*t I get in\nThe more ignorant the incident is\nI fit in\nIgnorin' the sh*t?\nHow boring it gets\nWhen there's no one to hit\nI don't know when to\nQuit throwin' a fit (nope)\nI know I'm a bit flaky\nBut they make me\nIt's they who hate me and\nSay they can take (c'mon)\nIt's they whose legs\nI break and make achey\nIt's they who mistake me\nMake me so angry (urgh)\nI'll sh*t on you\nI'll spit on you\nStart pissin' and do\nThe opposite on you\nYou weren't listenin'\nI said I'll cop a squad on you\nStart spillin' my guts like\nChicken cordeu bleu and straight sh*t\nLike Notorious BIG\nDid to that b**** on the\nSkit on his last album\nPull my pants down and\n\nRepeat chorus\n\n(Kon Artis:)\nIs Richard Pryor still alive?\nIf not I'm sicker than\nHe was prior to him dyin'\n(What)\nBorn brainless\nThis steel ain't stainless\nYour blood stains all\nOver this steel god-dangit\nB**** bring it\nThese niggas that I hang\nWith'll hang u up naked\nBy your ankles dangling\nBut need I stay straight\nWhen I don't need your help\nIf you won't gimmie ya pussy\nI'll unloosen my belt and\n(I'll sh*t on you)\nI bet your daddy's not\nYour momma's kinda caught\nYour sister's chin crushed\nYa aunt supply ya rocks\nBuck fifty 'cross your neck\nBlow up your tech\nI'll beat you across your chest\n\n(Kuniva:)\nYo It's only right\nI jack the car keys and run\nSpent all of my advancements\nOn weed and guns\nFor fun when I'm drunk\nI run a truck through\nThe weed house\nJump out and beat your peeps\nDown worse than Steve Stought\nPut you in choke holds\nI learned last week\nFrom the police man\nWho caught me stealing weed\nFrom his jeep\n(Hey, hey, hey)\nI see h*es fightin'\nY'all don't wanna brawl\nThat's like Deebo fightin'\nPeabo Bryson (uh)\nI'll sh*t on you\nF*** what your\nHollerin' and yellin' about\nI'll reach in your mouth and\nPull your f***in' skeleton out\nNiggas get hit with a 2-Peace\nBling bling\nWith a poisonous thing\nI'm such a violent thing\n\nRepeat chorus\n\n(Eminem:)\nOnce I get on two hits of ex\nMy disc slips and disconnects\n'Till I walk around this b****\nWith a twisted neck\nBut still sh*t on the first b****\nThat disrespects\nI'll sh*t on you\nOver reaction is my only reaction\nWhich only sets off a chain reaction\nThat puts five more zany\nActin' maniacs in action\nA rat pack in black jackets\nWho pack 10 9 millimeters\n5 criminals pullin' heaters and\nSpillin' liters of blood like swimmin' pools\nShiesty individuals\nShoot at b****es too\nA lot of people say\nMisogynistic which is true\nI don't deny it\nMatter of fact I stand by it\nSo please stand by\nAt the start of a damn riot\nIf you don't wanna\nGet stampeded then stand quiet\n(That's)\nBoy girl dog woman man child\n\nI'll sh*t on you\nDa da da da", "image":
