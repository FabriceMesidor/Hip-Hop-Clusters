Do you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?\nWanna copy me and do exactly like I did?\nTry 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?\nMy brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight\nBut I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate\nAnd Dr. Dre said \"Slim Shady, you a basehead!\"\nUh-uhhh! \"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!\"\nWell, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else\n\u2018Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt\nGot pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross\nI smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass\nFaster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast\nCome here, slut! \"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!\"\nI don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high\nThe only problem was, my English teacher was a guy\nI smacked him in his face with an eraser\nChased him with a stapler\nStapled his nuts to a stack of papers\nWalked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up\nFlashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup\nExtraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians\nWhile they're screaming, \"Let's just be friends!\"\n99 percent of my life I was lied to\nI just found out my mom does more dope than I do\nI told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper\nMake a record about doing drugs and name it after her\nYou know you blew up when the women rush your stands\nAnd try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans\nThis guy at White Castle asked for my autograph\nSo I signed it: \"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nStop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away!\nDr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!\nI'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die\nI'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive\nAm I coming or going? I can barely decide\nI just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?\nAll my life I was very deprived\nI ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide\nClothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk\nI spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks\nWhen I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits\nHow you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!\nI lay awake and strap myself in the bed\nPut a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head\nI'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad\nTell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
