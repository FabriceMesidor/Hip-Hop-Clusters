Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Y\u2019all don\u2019t want to lose again. A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y\u2019all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it\u2019s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can\u2019t play what they want to play because they\u2019ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I\u2019m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He\u2019s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y\u2019all think?\n\n[crowd shouts \u201cKanye\u201d and other names]\n\nNope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.\n\nRadio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I\u2019m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I\u2019m taking his lead. I\u2019ma just say how I say, be \u2018Ye, and win. I\u2019ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Aye, is it, \u201c'Radio, fuck you?' That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\u201d Exactly.\n\nNot fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they\u2019re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y\u2019all love my show. When I say these names, y\u2019all better scream for me. I don\u2019t give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that\u2019s the future. That\u2019s the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It\u2019s life.\n\nWe\u2019ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times \u201cyou say you wanna play for free?\u201d Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro!\n\nAnd let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I\u2019m on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyonc\u00e9 had the best video. Hey, baby, let\u2019s rock and roll tonight. Y\u2019all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it\u2019s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!\n\nKhaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio\u2019s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn\u2019t make America great because he couldn\u2019t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn\u2019t allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don\u2019t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don\u2019t always change shit, bro!\n\nSo, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyonc\u00e9, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called \u201cFade\u201d and I don\u2019t expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don\u2019t respect you. I will let you know that Beyonc\u00e9 is winning the video tonight for \u201cFormation\u201d over \u201cHotline Bling\u201d and \u201cFamous.\u201d' They told me beforehand so I wouldn\u2019t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y\u2019all ain\u2019t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I\u2019ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyonc\u00e9, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your \u2014hey, nigga, don\u2019t throw no shit while I\u2019m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y\u2019all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \"Hotline Bling.\" In my opinion \u2014 now, don\u2019t go trying to diss Beyonc\u00e9. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!\n\nBut sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I\u2019ve been sitting here to give y\u2019all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I\u2019ve been sitting here to give y\u2019all the truth.\n\nJay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain\u2019t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don\u2019t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I\u2019m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain\u2019t above, below none of y\u2019all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn\u2019t like that! Guess what? Y\u2019all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.\n\nIt\u2019s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it\u2019s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It\u2019s a new world. It\u2019s a new world, Barack! It\u2019s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don\u2019t send killers at my head, bro! This ain\u2019t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let \u2018Ye be \u2018Ye. And wait a second, do y\u2019all agree with that? Let \u2018Ye be \u2018Ye! Wait a second, I ain\u2019t hear enough screams on that. Let \u2018Ye be \u2018Ye!\n\nPeople, I\u2019m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn\u2019t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y\u2019all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y\u2019all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain\u2019t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon\u2019 win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can\u2019t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!\n\nMark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn\u2019t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn\u2019t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!\n\n[to DJ] Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.\n\nShia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.\n\nQ-Tip, I love you, bro. Don\u2019t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don\u2019t tell me how to be me, though. I\u2019ve been me, I am me. There\u2019s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That\u2019s happened with musicians because they\u2019re scared. I\u2019m not scared! I\u2019m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won\u2019t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been blessed with. My vision! I\u2019m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I\u2019m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready! Because the show\u2019s over.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/61bed0c74188e6f897c50931c37a748c.640x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
