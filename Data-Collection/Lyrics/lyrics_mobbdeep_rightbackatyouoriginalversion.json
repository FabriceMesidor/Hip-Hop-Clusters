What the fuck possessed you\nTo come out your face, now I have to wet you\nThrow on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent\nTwist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Hype Da Madman]\nStraight up and down, Imma let you know now\nYou feel the gunshot bloaw from the Red Eye style\nNow pass the owl and let me roll the method\nShit\u2019s hectic while I\u2019m cested, where\u2019s the mic? Let me wreck it, check it\nMy rugged rhyme, lyrical design hit your spine\nEvery time that the Red Eye shine\nBlinds the naked eye cause they can\u2019t see through\nThe smoked screen behind the scene stands the Red Eye crew\nNow it\u2019s true, my spiritual comes through my physical\nBoth connected by the method, therefore I\u2019m lyrical\nSo what you gonna down I come to pursue\nWith my Tec 22 and infra red on you?\nFor real, my laser beam likes to s[???] when I squeeze\nI\u2019m like a sniper when I strike you, steady busting from trees\nMCs, you know my steez, I\u2019m living trifle with the rifle\nPunks I make them st[???] feed they ass to my disciples\n\n[Verse 4: Big Noyd]\nMy little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling\nThe game got him bugging, I trying to tell him slow down cousin\nBut he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects\nBut with no doubt, shortie's out for his respect\nBut is his brain insane from the lye?\nFrom smoking that one eighteen tiny tye\nWhy, a nigga just died last week\nAs he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street\nAnd it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack macs\nHis eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back\nBut I'm stressed and I need to be blessed\nWith a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that\nSlow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?\nYou must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me\nThen he was Swayze...", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/d771033f8687bf7bd175167abb7a040b.619x401x1.png"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
