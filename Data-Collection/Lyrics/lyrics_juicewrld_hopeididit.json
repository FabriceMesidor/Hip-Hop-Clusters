I don't get it, I'm tryna give you my soul, you can see the ugly in it\nYou done killed all my depression, you don't get it\nI hope I killed all your depression, hope I did it (Hope I did it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nDown I fall, Berlin Wall\nPut my heart on the line, risk it all\nGirl you brought me to life, resurrect up\nI'm the ugly duck, that's my confession\nIn love I fall, curtains closed\nBut I open up to you, I am exposed\nEvery day I'm high off you, I overdose\nIf I ain't doin' right by you, let me know\n\n[Chorus]\nI wonder if I'm really enough, really enough\nYou tell me that you're really in love, really in love\nI always seem to mess this up, piss you off\nAnd even when I'm looking out, I fucked that up\nHow?
