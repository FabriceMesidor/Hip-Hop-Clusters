This is a new year\nNigga we got somethin' to do here\n\n[Verse Two]\n0-6\nWe gonna be comin' with mo' shit\nThe most wicked\nWe got something to prove here\nThe coke fix is\nBack like crack\nThe 80's is at ya\nThe only ink that's sicker is maybe the tattoo\nWhen them players is at you/achu\nBlowin' they triggers\nYou gone\nThe only thing stiffer is maybe a statue\nC'mon\nHe deliver like that stork\nHe bring light to your porch\nHe bring night and he ain't lightin' your torch\nHis king sight just seems like Yao Ming's height\nHe sees over\nHe don't need to lean over\nHe don't need to move you to see on\nHe only will do it when he tell you to keep on...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's just me and (who?) Whoo Kid\n\nWith the blue pigs in the rear\n\nView mirror with the two cigs in the ear\n\nLike, Who cares?
