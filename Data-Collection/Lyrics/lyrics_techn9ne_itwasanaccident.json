He said \"Yeah, let me see\"\nI pulled it out and gave it a good squeeze\nI didn't know it didn't have no safety\nNow this man is hit in his chest and he can't breathe\nDevil on my shoulder whispering \"Leave, nigga leave\"\nBut I swear\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nIt was an accident\nHa ha ha, oooooooooo\nIt was an accident\nHa ha ha, oooooooooo\nIt was an accident\nHa ha ha, oooooooooo\nIt was an accident\nHa ha ha, oooooooooo\nIt was an accident\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nI don't be findin' trouble, it be findin' me\nI don't be findin' trouble, it be findin' me\nI don't be findin' trouble, it be findin' me\nI don't be findin' trouble, it be findin' me\nEm 'nidnif eb ti elbuort 'nidnif eb t'nod I\nEm 'nidnif eb ti elbuort 'nidnif eb t'nod I\nEm 'nidnif eb ti elbuort 'nidnif eb t'nod I\nEm 'nidnif eb ti elbuort 'nidnif eb t'nod I\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne & Alan Wayne]\n\u2014 What you scared of?\n\u2014 Shit, nigga I ain't scared of nuttin, what you scared of?\n\u2014 Damn, I ain't really scared of nothing for real man, but it's like I'm scared as hell of lightening aahaha\n\u2014 Ahh\n\u2014 You know I'm saying lightening..
