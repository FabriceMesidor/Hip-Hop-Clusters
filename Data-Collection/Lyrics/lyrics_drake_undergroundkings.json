That's me on some psychic shit\nI can tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts\nBut I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about\nRap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches\nAnd rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear\nIt's been two years since somebody asked me who I was\nI'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was\nThat's what's important, what really happened before this\nWhen me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans\nSinging, \"Walking like a man, finger on the trigger\nI got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah\"\nWith fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves\nI was pushing myself to get something that I deserve\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I need that romance\nSometimes I need that pole dance\nSometimes I need that stripper\nThat's gon' tell me that she don't dance\nTell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good\nDo me like the women from my town would\nLeather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors\nTalking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for\nMemphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back\nAnd Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack\nAnd these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth\nAnd they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south\nAnd every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like\nSo why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like\nSo I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade\nSoon as I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid\nAnd if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball\nI'm counting all day like a clock on the wall, yeah, I need that\nMaking major changes to the life I'm living\nI had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\n'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga\nDo it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50b0608affc94c4dae3d502a65ea390.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
