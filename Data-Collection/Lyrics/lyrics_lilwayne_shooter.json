(yeah)\"\nI turn around, I was staring at chrome (hello!)\nShotgun watches door, got security good (check!)\nJumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink\nHe tell her, \"I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter\" (let's go!)\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nMy hands up (yeah!), my hands up (yeah!)\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, \"Shooter!\"\nMy hands up (yeah!), my hands up (yeah!)\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, \"Shooter!\" (get 'em, yeah!)\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nSo many doubt cause I come from the South\nBut when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out\nBang! Die, bitch-nigga, die! I hope you bleed a lake\nI'mma play x-ray, helping y'all see the fake\nI'm just trying to be the Great, trying to get a piece of cake\nTake it off of your plate, eat it right in your face\nThey got a whole lot to say but I don't listen\nCall me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow!\n\n[Break: Robin Thicke]\nAll these bitches and, all these bitches!\nBut ain't no lovers around\nThey thinking about shooting! Them shooters\nGot the guns, girls. Ladies, them gunners that\nShoot shoot shoot shoot! Shooters!\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nMy hands up, my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, \"shooter!\"\nMy hands up, my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, \"shooter!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nAnd to the radio stations, I'm tired of being patient\nStop being rapper racists, region-haters\nSpectators, dictators, behind door dick-takers\nIt's outrageous! You don't know how sick you make us\nI want to throw it up like chips in Vegas\nBut this is Southern, face it\nIf we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics\n\n[Bridge: Robin Thicke]\nLady walks into a shotgun surprise\nDropped to her knees, saw her life before her eyes\nHe said: \"bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it\nI'm your - shooter!\"\n\n[Hook: Robin Thicke]\nMy hands up, my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, \"shooter!\"\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]\nSocks soaking wet, I been running y'all, I reload\nEvery hundred yards, I'm comin' forward\nYou better know me, Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard\nTake pain like Tylenols, raw, way past par\nFar, I'm some shit you never saw\nI take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw\nAnd then they ask who, when, where, how, and\nMy reply was simply, \"Pow!\" C'mon!\n\n[Outro: Lil Wayne]\nMama, I tink dat, ay!\nMe tink dey want me to surrender!\nNo! No, I'm sayin'\nMama, I tink dey, ay!\nMe tink dey want me to surrender!\nNo, no, me won't surrender\nNo, no, I promise no surrender\nI got my burner\nAnd I'm the shooter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/98c56aa11e01a9c25b7485cc3a25c78f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
