Girl, you like to smoke on the tree?\nAre you a rockstar? Do you like to get gnarly?\nWe 'bout to turn it up and turn it up and turn up some more\nIt feel like they turned the heater on when we walk in the door\nI come to have a good time and vibe out with the hood\nIt's a long line outside the club coming in here\nYou wanna get wasted then wanna get drunk, drunk as you can?\nLet me see you rotate, let me see you pop on a handstand\nYou could just post up in the club if you don't like to dance\nThis a celebration for every street nigga with bands\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/383bdf7e658c81236926af98a9211465.780x780x1.png"}], "artist": "Future"}
