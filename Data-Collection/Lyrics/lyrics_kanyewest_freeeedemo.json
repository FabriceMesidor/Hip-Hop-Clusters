I feel free (Scoop)\nNothin' hurts me anymore\nGuess what, baby? I feel free\n\n[Verse: Kanye West]\nCreated in nah-nah-nah\nGuess what, baby? I feel free\nAnd you know damn well\nAh! I don't feel pain anymore\nGuess what, baby? I feel free\nYou should quit your job to this\nHold up, let 'em drop the mist\nGot on the concert\nOne stunt in yours, don't stunt on us\nThey stunted on, ah\nI don't feel pain anymore\nGuess what, baby? I feel free\nThis like a mix of some Ja Rule shit and some King Krule shit\nDon't assume shit, the news shit\nThis a fool shit, I'm on some bullshit\nI'm on some wildin' out in some new shit\nI'm on somethin', 'bout to lose it\nTake your con and does it, don't double fools it\nLyor come up arguin' saying, \"Don't lose the music\"\nI got none' but cool shit, I been known to lose it\nYou stuck with a bunch of motherfuckers you don't know\nLike a cruise ship\nHottest on new shit, bangin' on that new shit\nPopstar, move it\nMan, he goin' foolish\nMan, he goin' stupid\nMan, he got the movement\nNow they couldn't move it\nTalkin' in jewels, yeah\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nCan't not bump 'em anymore\nGuess what, baby?
