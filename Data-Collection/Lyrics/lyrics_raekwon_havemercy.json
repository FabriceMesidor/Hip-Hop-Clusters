Extra holes right in your derriere\nThe blitzes, the rushes'll touch something, back in the cells\nTwo days later, yup, back in them cuffs again\nOr leaning on the customers, hustlers, my hood illustrious\nMarvelous raps, screw on mufflers (have mercy)\n\n[Hook: Raekwon w/ Blue Raspberry ad-libbing]\nTo all my gun holders, stand up, get it\nCuz when the killas come around, it's on\nBullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast\nSay some back shit, your flagship gone\nCan't play the building no more\nCan't hang around by the store no more\nIt's really on, you a dickhead\nNow you a dead man with no hand\nNow you can't believe you jammed\n\n[Outro: Blue Raspberry]\nAhhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh\nIt hurts my heart, to see what's going on\nYoung men dying now, children going when they're born\nOh no, oh no, oh no, oh whoa\nOh no, oh whoa, where is this world going to?
