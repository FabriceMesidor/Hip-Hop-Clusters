Aight, let's get busy\nRun up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck\nYo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)\nWe on the clock, three minutes until we finished\nFeds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach\nIn and out, duffel bag across the back\nExtra large sports coat to cover up the Mac\nFeds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out\nRun up on a civilian in his car, make him get out\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Verse 3: DMX]\nHigh speed chasin', racin' through the streets\nDeath's in the air, I can taste it through the heat\nMy partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last\nBut if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half\nBut that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'\nI made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens\nWhat can I do, but go on livin'\nFleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon\nLife goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey\nWe all live by the rules of the game we play\nDay to day, death is a possibility\nThe way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me\nIt's too hot to be in the heat 'casue it's on\nToo hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone\nGo back to bein' discreet, live long\n'Til one day either me or the heat is gone\nCome On!\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\n\n[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beats]\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to fly\nThe heat is on\nAre y'all really ready to die\nThe heat is on\nHave your mother ready to cry\nThe heat is on\nHuh\nThe heat is on\nYou know\nThe heat is on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/236ac8cb125196c489579b947c3b2fb8.945x945x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
