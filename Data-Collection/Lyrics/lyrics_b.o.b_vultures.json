(USA)\nAnd I ask you was it an act of valour or a strange reality? (Huh?)\nAnd they make us free thinkers feel like we the radicals (Huh?)\nBut the world is a battlefield\nAnd right now we the Establishment (Woo)\nWhen it comes to war, there's no real parameters\nAmerican pie is the sweet distraction\nFrom what's really happening\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI can see the vultures, fly over me\nWatchin' me all the time\nWith blood on their wings\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI, see the plan is to eradicate the planet\nAnyone who opposes mysteriously will vanish\nThe travesties are endless, the list is gigantic\nThe stakes have been raised, time to wheel in the cannons, it's propaganda\nAnd all they gotta do is turn on the cameras (Lights, camera, action)\nAnd they'll say anything to make it all look random (make it all look random)\nAs they hide the keys to unlock the answers\nLast time I check the double standard is not a standard at all\nAnd we fall, and we struggle just to get right back up and then fall\nBut we climb, and we crawl, and we fight 'til it's off\nAnd we search through the dark\nTrynna make sense of these laws just to figure out that it's flawed\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI can see the vultures, fly over me\nWatching me all the time\nWith blood on their wings\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\nI feel 'em getting closer, closer\n\n[Outro: B.o.B]\nWatching over me, over me\nTrying to get a hand and control of me\nControlling me, controlling me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5c49104d5de1bbfefcb27959d392d8c4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
