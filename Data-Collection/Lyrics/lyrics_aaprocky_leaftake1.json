Most of these niggas been gay or they strange\nThey say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max\nLittle bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\n[Verse 2: Squadda B]\nOnce again, Mister Back Selling Crack\nIt's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map\nStreet raps, new face, sampled with no credits\nDoubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate\nTo my surprise everyone does, so have faith\nHalf of the other side don't live it they push play\nThe young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay\nIt feels good waking up to money in the bank\nCause last year it was shoe box and lint\nI only write raps just to give you niggas hints\nEvery verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney\nMy album coming November, that's 20 years of memory\nAnd that's assuming I'mma live that long\nIf I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong\nJust an artist in a purest form, I live that song\nAn artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\n[Verse 3: Mondre M.A.N]\nWhy fuss? I'd rather fuck\nTreat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust\nSeven deuce, waiting on the bus\nBefore the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust\nTryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks\nPurple and the green got me on stuck\nSo I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing\nAlways bouncing back, got it keep the cushion\nAnd that's something fat, like eating all the pudding\nA$AP we got it slap, bruh good looking\nFuck That, A$AP where I come from\n456, Ice City slums\nWeed in my pocket, coke in his tongues\nBuying swisher sweets, no more honey buns\nFresh white tee, bright like the sun\nOnly nigga round here rocking \u041c\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]\nI'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket\nI'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it\nTake a hit with me, take a hit with me\nAin't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean\nChilling with my niggas, with my team\nCome and take a sip with me, take a sip with me\n\n[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]\n\"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings\nThe little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you\nKeep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you\nI'mma always love you, forever\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fb9bbbba50174ef41a0dd1f68902363.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "A$AP Rocky"}
