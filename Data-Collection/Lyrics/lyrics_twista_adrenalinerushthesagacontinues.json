like two bad nurses\nAnd the pain from these here, motherfuckin' verses\nRidiculous thirstses involving hearses to the dirt, shit\nFirst picks and use 'n autos to work with slugs to the shirt, shit\n(Just to squirt shit)\n\nA wicked hit with an expert kick and burst 'til the earth split\nLeave you hurt bitch, show you how worser than worst\nGet in the zone, see the vein when the pain repel\nAnd then they closin' the curtains, bitch\n(When adrenaline's pumpin')\n\nI don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit\nI'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high\nGot me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit\n\nWhat can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel\nTo make me wanna jump off of the edge\nI'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge\nNo pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head\n(So tell me what it said)\n\nRetaliate with lethal repercussion, I feel the reefer rushing\nTo go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick\nTook the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal\nTo get the kickin' shit for niggas and bitches that I kick it with\n\nI was born to get you pumped up\nIt's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush\nThen yo' head bust when you jumped up\n'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed\n\nFrom smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die\nMake me wanna slip the clip on the side\nAnd if you act like a bitch on the side\nIf we have to then the whole Westside'll\nLet the shit go on and ride when the trigga bust\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\nPullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit\nStart up buryin' some heads like an ostrich\nAnd unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells in the garbage\nThe hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve\nWhat I've accomplished\n\nYungbuck's my accomplice\nLocated his existence with my sixth sense like a compass\nAnd starting on a journey established to stop this\nRushing up the hearts of other niggas to get 'em charged\n\nWhat's the real reason?\nAll you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season\nAnd even though I'm still bleedin'\nI'm comin' after you cause I'm still breathin'\n\nAnd y'all can't trace me\nI bury my victims in the wall like Gacey, too lyrical\nAnd since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical\nMy music is miracle like I'm biblical\n\nKillin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love\nAnd still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up\nAnd speed the fuck up getaway smokin' this blunt\nDump the adrenaline eruptin' my veins I'm pumped up\n\nAnd I'm calibrated at 360 degrees\nSee that's 300 niggas that's gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed\n(Psycho Drama)\nWe too much for the industrialistic fuck\nWith this on the brink of fuckin' up some shit\n\nDismantle, deduct some shit\nIt's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do\n(What niggas got nerves to do)\nSo I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you\n\nThen think what I'm on the verge to do\nAnd I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo curtains fool\nFrom killin' the verses fool, I be one of the worstest dude\n(You, the who?)\nI'm the worstest workin' about 9 millimeters above your surface\nUnleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose, bitch you hurtin'\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh\n\n(Let your adrenaline rush)\nLike when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make a trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass, kick up and bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\nLet your adrenaline rush", "image": "https://images.genius.com/37a0e3023180b834b869e6ad5b51b224.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
