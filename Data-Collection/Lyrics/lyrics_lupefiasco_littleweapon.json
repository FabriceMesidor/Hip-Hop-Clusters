Well, I'm like 10, 11\nBeen fighting since I was like six, or seven\nNow I don't know much about where I'm from\nBut I know I strike fear everywhere I come\nGovernment want me dead so I wear my gun\nI really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young\nThis candy give me courage not to fear no one\nTo feel no pain and hear no tongue\nSo I hear no screams and I shed no tear\nIf I'm in your dreams then your end is near, it's me\n\n[Hook: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use, little weapon\nLittle weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow\n\n[Bridge]\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nNow here comes the march of the boy brigade\nA macabre parade of the toys he made\nIn shemaghs and shades, who look half his age\nAbout half the size of the flags they wave\nAnd camouflage suits made to fit youths\n'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a little loose\nWhere AK47s that they shooting into heaven\nLike they tryna kill a Jetson that struggles little recruits\nCute, smileless, heartless, violent\nChildhood destroyed, devoid of all childish  ways\nCan't write their own names\nOr read the words that's on their own graves\nThink you gangsta, popped a few rounds?\nThese kids'll come through and murder a whole town\nThen sit back and smoke and watch it burn down\nThe grave gets deeper the further we go down\nIt's little weapon\n\n[Hook: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use, little weapon\nLittle weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow\n\n[Verse 3: Bishop G]\nImagine if I had to console\nThe families of those slain I slayed on game consoles\nI aim my hole, right trigger to squeeze\nPress up and Y, one less nigga breathe\nB for the bombs, press pause for your moms\nMake the room silent, she don't approve of violent\nGames; she leave, resume activity\nStart in blue heart, subpar sharp wizardry\nOn next part, I insert code\nTo sweeten up the little person's murder workload\nI tell him he work for CIA with A\nA operative, I operate this game all day\nI hold the controller connected to the soldier\nWith weapons on his shoulder, he's only seconds older\nThan me, we playful but serious\nNow keep that on mind for online experience\n\n[Hook: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon, we're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use, little weapon\nLittle weapon, little weapon, we need you now, pow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f097b99dcc00024d51d3fba2d7b73cf6.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
