New children in the buildin' (step back)\nRide with no limits\nShut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?\nI'm in a bad mood\nI'm in a bad mood\n\n[Verse 2]\nRob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house\nHol' on, you too close\nI keep a classy one for the toast\n'Cause my ghetto one do the most\nMan, I'm so serious\nDon't fucking talk to me\nI'm in a bad mood\nOooh, your skin mahogany\nOooh, let's break the monotony\nGovernment threw us in a maze\nHad me trickin' 40k for some grades\nJust to make 40k for the wage\nDropped out and made that in one day\nI'm in a good mood\n\n[Verse 3]\nOooh, I'm wildin' on 'em\nOooh, back pilin' on 'em\nI never feel the pain, only God can make it rain\nSo I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah\nKid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal\nJumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho\nThey tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty\nAnxiety after the meds, Kris Bobbi", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
