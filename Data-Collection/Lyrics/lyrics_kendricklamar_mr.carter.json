I'm just getting started\nBut you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi\nWeezy, new born baby? and it's my party\nAnd I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri\nLike new cocaine, bright yellow dope?\nBright red flag like a red velvet rope\nOpen for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism\nWhen this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less\nBitch, I be and I been ballin'\n\n[Hook]\nI'm in the studio\nAll day all night\nCookin up the flow\nGettin' my career right\nAs I should\nTryna get my mama up out the hood\nSo don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke\nCause all my life I've been broke\nI'm K-Dot if you didn't know\nAiming straight for the top\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nMmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off\nSend 'em off to the holy one\nPut a hole in one, like miniature golf\nPrice on your head, and they trying to purchase\nNo matter the cost\nHand over the cloth\nCloth over the gun\nGun over your jaw\nBullet over your tongue\nStick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung\nEvery time I get a chance to come over I overcome\nOver the snare drums\nThey say, \"Who fucking with you if you the god MC?\"\nI tell 'em none\nGet it? I tell 'em none\nCatholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums\nIn the back of my True Religions\nNever passed the bar but\nI ain't got to study law\nJust to judge lyrics\nMmm, I should be the judge of lyrics\nBang the gavel, give you a life sentence\n\n[Hook]\nI'm in the studio\nAll day all night\nCookin up the flow\nGettin' my career right\nAs I should\nTryna get my mama up out the hood\nSo don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke\nCause all my life I've been broke\nI'm K-Dot if you didn't know\nAiming straight for the top", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b626036c563b0aefa7a5b83f1fb9302.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
