Rihanna:]\n\n[Chorus: ~Rihanna~]\nYou're gonna be a shining star*\nYour fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars\nAnd then you'll see, you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you a-are\nSo live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nYou instead of chasing at paper\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\nJust live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\n\n[Verse 1: ~T.I.~]\nNever mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away\nAmazing they ungreatful after all the game I gave away\nSafe to say I paid the way for you cats to get paid today\nYou'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day\nConsider them my prot\u00e9g\u00e9, homage I think they should pay\nInstead of being gracious they violate in a major way\nI never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way\nSome say they sold yah and no they couldn't even work on Labor day\nIt ain't that they black or white, their hands in areas the shades of grey\nI'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away\nSome move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid\nI brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away\nI pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away\nLike I once made them spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away\nBeen thugging all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break\nYou would rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna]\nYou're gonna be a shining star\nYour fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars\nAnd then you'll see, you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you a-are\nSo live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nYou instead of chasing at paper\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\nJust live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nI'm the opposite of moderate\nImmaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid\nAllergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics\nArticulate but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick\nWhoever having problems with their record sales just holla 'tip\nIf that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow 'tip\nI got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it\nCould do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comically\nThe hooting and the hollering, back and forth with the arguing\nWhere you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in\nSeems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositing\nThem checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty\nYour values is in disarray, prioritizing horribly\nUnhappy with the riches 'cause you piss poor morally\nIgnoring all prior advice and fore warning\nAnd we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna]\nYou're gonna be a shining star\nYour fancy clothes, your fancy ca-ars\nAnd then you'll see, you're gonna go far\n'Cause everyone knows who you a-are\nSo live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nYou instead of chasing at paper\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\nAin't got no time for no haters\nJust live your life (ay), ay ay ay\nNo telling where it'll take ya\nJust live your life (oh), ay ay ay\n'Cause I'm a paper chaser\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\nJust living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)\n\n[Verse 3: Rihanna]\nGot everybody watching what I do\nCome walk in my shoes\nAnd see the way I'm living if you really want to\nGot my mind on my money and I'm not going nowhere\nSo keep on getting your paper and keep on climbing\nLook in the mirror and keep on shining\n'Till the game ends, 'till the clock stops\nWe gon' post up on the top spot\nLiving the life, the life\nIn a brand new city got my whole team with me\nThe life, my life\nI do what I wanna do\nI'm living my life, my life\nI will never lose\nI'm living my life, my life\nAnd I'm not stopping\nSo live your life!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68262ccdcbffb87427d31b0d6085c2e3.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
