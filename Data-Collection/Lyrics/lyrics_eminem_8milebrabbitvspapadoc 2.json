Look, look...\nNow, while he stands tough\nNotice that this man did not have his hands up\nThis Free World's got you gassed up\nNow, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\nOne, two, three, and to the four\nOne Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four\nFour Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one\nYou're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none\nThis guy ain't no motherfucking MC\nI know everything he's 'bout to say against me\nI am white, I am a fucking bum\nI do live in a trailer with my mom\nMy boy Future is an Uncle Tom\nI do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob\nWho shoots himself in his leg with his own gun\nI did get jumped by all six of you chumps\nAnd Wink did fuck my girl\nI'm still standing here screaming, \"Fuck the Free World!\"\nDon't ever try to judge me, dude\nYou don't know what the fuck I've been through\nBut I know something about you\nYou went to Cranbrook, that's a private school\nWhat's the matter, dawg, you embarrassed?\nThis guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence\nAnd Clarence lives at home with both parents\nAnd Clarence parents have a real good marriage\nThis guy don't wanna battle, he's shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nHe's scared to death, he's scared to look\nAt his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!\nFuck a beat, I'll go a cappella\nFuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer\nFuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!\nI'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly\nAnd fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie\nHere, tell these people something they don't know about me\n\n[Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie)]\nYo...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9725f210095b79fcf03eec18117d701e.1000x563x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
