If so homie, take it slow\nPop a bottle with some dro, let all of your worries go\nConsume yourself within this flow\nWhether your girl is actin' up or your man was cheating on you\nOr you can't pay your bills or you can't take it no mo'\nOr somebody done passed away\nBe strong and live another day\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is Shakespeare's mind state, 808 and heartbreak\nThey feelin' so alone, can someone relate to their heart's ache?\nUsed to walk into a room and that would make their heart race\nBut you ain't seen that person for some time and now your heart aches\nNow do you even know where you really wanna go?\nYou been down that street before, maybe you should take it slow\nThink about the life you livin', but don't think so hard it hurts\nLife is truly a gift but at the same it is a curse\nNow, you gotta persevere, get over any fear\nYou let go of the wheel, but now I think it's time to steer\nSo show 'em that you ready and show 'em that you strong\nBut not tonight cause you gon' get your good time on\n\n[Chorus]\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\nI said, I just wanna smoke and I just wanna drink\nThere's so much on my mind, that I don't even wanna think\n\n[Outro (Sampled)]\nLet me know\nLet me know\nLet me know\nLet me know, let me know\nLet me know, let me know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f21a1e2589d732e4a263527296e9f51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
