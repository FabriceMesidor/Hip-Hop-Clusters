Put your money up\nAll you see is license plates far in front of ya\nI gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life\nShe licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier\nGlass house on the block, five floors in it\nGot a picture on the wall that cost more than it\nYou observing it, I'm absorbing it\nJudge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him\nIgnoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims\nI'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than Ms\nI'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am\nAnd foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films\nMy warrant's clear as day like Doris is\nWhen I ain't trippin then my lawyers is\nSo what the charges is?\nPut it on my tab, baller shit\nI'm from the cell to the mall with this\n\n[Hook]\nNow tell them motherfuckers, I'm\nI'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden, I'm\nI'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden, I'm\n\n[Bridge]\nSoon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley\nAnd I'mma honk the horn, ridin' passed the penitentiary\nAnd I'mma drive slow, ridin' passed the elementary\nThen give it to my whoas, tell 'em \"Don't even mention\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne time\nFor the hustlers and the young moms\nMy presidential said it's crunch time\nLooking in my son's eyes\nOnly time I see a upside\nI tell him he gon' be a tough guy\nNever be a punchline\nTell him never wait in one line\nTell him not even a lunch line\nPray more than sometimes\nWhen the cops come, you tongue-tied\nTake dirt, make a mud pie\nLookin' out the window\nIn the coupe with a bimbo\nTalking 'bout who she resemble\nBitch, you in a Enzo\nStop being so simple\nNow fuck me like we in a limo\nI ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill\nI got ocean views, I got water bills\nI got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal\nI got larger wheels on my automobile\nI lost appeal\nThe bullshit cost me a mill\nIt brought me to tears\nI came home and bought me a crib\nI walk through that bitch\nStrapped when it's dark in that bitch\nAnd through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge\nI got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge\nI started to swig\nBut end up drinking all of that shit\n'Cause I deserve it\nI be working hard for all of this shit\nI step into a Rolls Royce\nWhen I walk out the pen\n\n[Hook]\nMy nigga I'm, I'm post-bail ballin, post-bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'\nPost-bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post-bail ballin'\nFarewell warden, I'm post-bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden I'm post-bail ballin'\nInmate Carter: Post-bail ballin'\n\n[Outro]\nSoon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley\nAnd I'mma honk the horn ridin' past the penitentiary\nAnd I'mma drive slow ridin' past the elementary\nThen give it to my whoas, tell 'em \"Don't even mention\"\nSoon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22c3b68c0f49bb742b34148131ca933d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
