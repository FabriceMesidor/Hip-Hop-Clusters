We were never ever friends\nWhere I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land\nKeep that cannon on my hip like Megaman\nYou either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan\nI pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again\nBut as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win\n\n[Verse 1]\nUhuh, yeah\nSaid that shit, I meant it\nUhuh, yeah\nIt's money over bitches\nUhuh, yeah\nYou niggas don't see the difference\nThat's why you broke and I'm rich\nBecause I see the difference\nI spend 100k in a month, I don't got shit to show for it\nBut I ain't worried bout shit I know I could always make more\nRacks came in, stretch it out the long way\nCame a long way, from wearing Choos up in the hallways, yeah\nI did it by myself, ain't had no company\nEverybody get they hands out now, Fuck do you want from me?\nYou want the secret to my sauce, you a wannabe\nYou will never ever be a boss, employee\n\n[Chorus]\nI pop up like Slenderman\nGucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands\nScooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'\nWho are you? We were never ever friends\nWhere I'm from? I'm from Never Ever Land\nKeep that cannon on my hip like Megaman\nYou either kill or be killed over here, Afghanistan\nI pop a handful of pills, over here won't feel again\nBut as long as you stay real over here, you bound to win\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI pop up like Slenderman\nGucci boots, I don't wear no Timberlands\nScooby Doo, bitches they be Meddlin'\nWho are you?
