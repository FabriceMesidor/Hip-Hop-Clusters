My music truly strong\nBecause I'm different all you cowards wanna shoo me gone\nYes this is Strange year, worldwide fame's near\nBut the game's queer\nSometimes I feel like I'm Rudolph the Reindeer\nAnd the music they said blows is on top and the cred grows\nYou're gonna have to open up the door for the bro with the red nose\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's real, people act a different way with me\nI feel don't nobody wanna play with me\nAnd that's ill 'cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes\nThe industry are my foes, they treat me like I got a red nose\nRed nose, red nose\nThey put me down and treat me like I got a red nose\nRed nose, red nose\nDon't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9a362e190654b8bffa77c4aed9b6a59e.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
