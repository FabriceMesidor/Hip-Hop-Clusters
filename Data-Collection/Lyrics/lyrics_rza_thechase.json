My four hundred horsepower truck\nHigh speed with the Ironman CD turned all the way up\nShots fired in back of me, they practically hit my tire\nYo I smell smoke, I hope my engine ain't on fire\nPulled off the road, hope this damn truck won't explode\nFelt like a scene from the last James Bond episode\nDrivin sixty miles per hour through weed trees and dead flowers\nBust the overdrive, couldn't control the power\nPushin through bushes, mud, bugs\nCovered the front and back windshield like carwash suds\nI couldn't see, I knew these niggas was gainin on me\nI tried to bust a 360, I crashed into a tree\nIt felt like a bulldozer, knocked my ass over\nI fell out the Rover, grabbed the briefcase ran over\nTo a log cabin, had a sign posted DO NOT ENTER\nI bust through the door my body got cut up with splinters\nI ain't give a FUCK, tryin to find somewhere to duck\nAhh, ahh, uhhhhh, ahh\nAnd catch my breath, count how many shots I had left\nMy clip was full, the first nigga walk through I'm gonna pull\nIt was Ivan Korlof, he came through with a sawed off\nBust the cannon shot and tore the rest of the fuckin door off\n\nBurst, break, run, jet, flee, boogey, move, be audi\nSlide, duck, dip, bounce, be ghost, escape, blazini, poof\nThe Genie, disappear, cast out like they ain't seen me\nKiller Bee, fast lamborghini\n(repeat 2X)\n\nJunk turned fragments scattered in all direction\nOne grazed me, on my kneecap but didn't faze me\nCount to three, jumped up, I fired back\nMy four-four snub slug, dug a hole in his head\nLike Dig Dug, partner crashes in\nWith the infrared precision shots, just missin\nNight vision goggles, shit had me boggled\nForty-Four mag, was too much to swallow\nHeld the briefcase in front of my face, jumped through the window\nDaring, got up and went like Dr. Kimball\n\nI burst, broke, ran, jetted, fleed, boogied, moved, was audi\nSlid, ducked, dipped, bounced, ghost, escaped, blazini, poof\nThe Genie, disappear, niggas out like they ain't seen me\nKiller Bee move with the speed of lamborghini\n\nBobby Steels on the track, word up\nBout to escape with the tape\nWord up", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd196cd64024f62198546045ae85968d.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
