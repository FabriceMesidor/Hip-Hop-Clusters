In American Apparel\nStanding down the barrel of the media\nFor the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia\nHis story, His glory\n\u2026and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us\nBut what happens?\nWhen one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen?\nYou know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. Real niggas you know what I mean\n- you know what I mean\n- you know what I mean\n- you know what I mean\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what I thought\nBut when they sayin\u2019 \u201cHey that\u2019s what the real nigga do, right?\u201d\nNaw not right, that\u2019s just mean, that\u2019s just me that\u2019s not, right\nNow how long did it take me to realize?\nAnd open up my fucking eyes!\nThat this shit is just a disguise\nAll the fame!\nAnd the power!\nAnd the hour!\nIn the showers!\nOf the diamonds!\nAnd the jewels!\nAnd the gold!\nEverybody say you cold!\nEverybody screaming at motha ****ing shows\nAnd you know what?\n\nYou wake up in the morning\nAnd in awe you\u2019re a real person\nAnd worse you got the \u2026?...\nGot a little bit harder\nA little bit more insignificant\nYou was the terrific ****\nBuying expensive ****\nLast year worked for Louis or Ford\nToo much for me to even record\nThe only thing I had to do was get my heart out\nThe greatest blessing in the world is the fact you let me get my art out\nThe fact that you accepted me and didn\u2019t neglect me\nEven when I was a \u2026?...\nEven when I went to these meetings straight dolo\nI had to go solo. I used to have a group\nThat group used to wear Adidas and\n\u2026?... and then I got stupid and left them niggas\nAnd said I\u2019m better than ya\u2019ll when it was true\nNow when I finally got the power man what the **** did I do?\n\nAnd I\u2019m so sorry to how every one of ya\u2019ll had to fight for my name\nEvery one of ya\u2019ll a year ago, that all waited for this change\nEveryone who said \u201cKanye is that nigga quit talkin\u2019 names\u201d\nAnd I know! I am the one to blame\nAnd the people that I-I-I, let down\nI want to tell you right here - right here, right now\nThat I\u2019m a new man that understands why people abusing the power\n\n*Crowd erupts drowning out the lyrics*\n\nAnd make more music for the world to love!\nAnd there\u2019s so many people I could thank there\u2019s my Mom and God and above\nSo all ya\u2019ll, and everybody throw your hands in the sky!\nEveryone touch the sky before the day never dies! dies! dies!\n\nNo one man should have all that power!\nThey say no one man should have all that power!\nThey say no one man should have all that power!\nThey say no one man should have all that power!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70c6e506a91f6dabdd23cad304812ce3.533x533x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
