II]\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]\nYeah, yeah\nYoung Egypt\nLook, look\n\n[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]\nI feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged\nOur Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large\nCame in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds\nWhat an accomplishment, broken promises\nKept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence\nThe greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is\nYou niggas fear me like y'all fear God\nYou sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice\nJust know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars\nBefore you poke out your chest, loosen your bra\nBefore you step out of line and dance with the star\nI could never end a career if it never start\nThe murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies\nWith batteries to the head\nThe flattery of watchin' my stock rise\nThe salary, the compensation tripled my cock size\nI run through these stop signs with no brake fluid\nJust premium gas, do it for dolo\nCrash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo\nBlack excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin\nHope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better\nI blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather\nForecastin' my future, this is the future\nThe mastermind until my next album, more power to you\n*Gunshot*\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]\nCome on,
