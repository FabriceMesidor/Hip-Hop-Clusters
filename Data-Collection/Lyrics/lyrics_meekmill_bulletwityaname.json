Jackson\nNiggas throwing money, they don't even own a crib yet\nAnd they ain't send no money to their niggas doing the bid yet\nYou ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet\nBut you making it rain you a fucking lame\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nI got a bullet with ya name on it\nCatch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it\nNiggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit\nYou get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed\nI have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head\nI'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nI hear them pussies talking\nThey talking reckless about me\nBut when I see them niggas I going to catch some wreck a body\nI'm talking shots fired, got a man down\nCoppers walkie talkie, over stand down\nShots still shooting choppers still chopping\nI ain't trap in like a year but the block still popping\nNiggas hating on me they don't got an option\nCause I'm shining perfect timing\nLike a diamond VVS shit\nNiggas can't fuck with me I'm like their ex bitch\nI'm on that homicide ride or die x shit\n44 revolver wild wild west shit\nNiggas talking reckless now they on my wreck list\nDeath wish bullets hit your front back exit\nYa hollow heads just to bobble heads\nAnd if we spot him there then we drop him there\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nI got a bullet with ya name on it\nCatch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it\nNiggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit\nYou get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed\nI have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head\nI'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya\n\n[Verse 3: Manny Wellz]\nMany many men [?]\nBut fuck a vest I keep a tec up on me\nFuck his chest I hit his head hit his face and hit his neck when I squeeze\n[?] fuck it\nLook we really do this here\nWe all shooters here\nThirty rounds in that four pound Ruger ya\nCome through here like you gon' talk shit out\nYou won't be walking out you be walking down\nBullets pounding from front to rear\nDoctors yelling clear and the nigga flatline\nHe been dead shots hit his chest came out his backside\nWe murder and snatch guys\nTake them to their stash spot\nSearch the premises until some money holler jackpot\nI'm on my own, thirty shots in the clip of my chrome\nI'm on your top little niggas is on\nI know some real live street niggas I can hit on the phone\nAnd get you shot broad day in your dome\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nI got a bullet with ya name on it\nCatch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it\nNiggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit\nYou get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed\nI have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head\nI'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/02fee89da0cebb67c2da7a31768e15c2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
