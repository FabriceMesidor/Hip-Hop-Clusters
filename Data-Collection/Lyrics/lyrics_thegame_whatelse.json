Can I breathe? Or will I die with this flag on my sleeve?\nWhat else, what else\nIs it war? Is it pain? Will I survive 'til the end of the game? What else, what else\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm on a suicide mission with pistols, I won't miss you\nYou with me, I'm with you, if not, the slug gon' hit you\nRip through your tissue, I don't think the world gon' miss you\nFull magazine, 15 covers, the next issue\nGhost, not the luxury car, I'm talkin' hollows\nSub-missiles flyin' through the sky\nYou can find me in the shark tank, topped off, loadin' the scars\nTramplin' dead bodies in the field, full of blood\nNo remorse, of course we gon' be lit\nWe soldiers, trained to murder and won't miss\nNo time to piss, the realest in the midst\nLost in foreign land and we eat where we shit\nLong machete arms, get chopped up in the jungle\nToday could be your last, to hard to remain humble\nDie by yourself 'cause you was born on your own\nSome of the greatest kings got murdered on they thrones\n\n[Hook]\nCan I live? Can I breathe? Or will I die with this flag on my sleeve?\nWhat else, what else\nIs it war? Is it pain? Will I survive 'til the end of the game? What else, what else", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ef938baba0c81d078dabbd1c96bd766.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
