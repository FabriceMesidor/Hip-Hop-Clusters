Listen, youth\nIt\u2019s like me holding up the line at the kissing booth\nI took her back to the truck, she was uncouth\nSpitting all out the sunroof through her missing tooth\nBut then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce\nSo I turnt it up faster than a speeding knife\nStrong enough to please a wife, able\nTo drop today\u2019s math in the 48 keys of life\nCut the crap.  Far as rap, touch the mic\nAnd get the same shit a Arab will do to you for stealing\nWhat the Devil?  He on another level\nIt\u2019s a word!  No, a name!
