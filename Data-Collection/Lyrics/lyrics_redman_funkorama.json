Uhh\nThat's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you\nI swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death\nThat's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul\nHot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech\nMy funk speech make words wear sun visors\nI'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks\n\n[Hook 4X: Q-Tip]\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk\n\n[Verse 2]\nAhhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers\nDef Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers\nPunks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice\nI'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight\nThe top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped\nI'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia\nI'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades\nI'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid\nMy grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama\nI never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters\nMy style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef\nDef like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep\nOne, two! Big up to my niggas on one-deuce\nThat cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*\nRrrrrah! With weed for you!\nWho says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?\nI cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up\nYou better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers\n'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam\nWhen I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T. Goose\nHeavily armed\n\n[Hook 8X: Q-Tip]\nComing down the block, man, loud as fuck\nYou would swear Redman was inside the trunk", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d8e65af95ee9832f58d26aa1b84b9ffa.600x607x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
