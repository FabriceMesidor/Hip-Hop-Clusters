I said I feel like a pooh but...\n\n[Hook]\nSometimes things just never go my way you know i, im just feelin like a pooh butt today\n\n[Break]\n(Chaos Kid) \"yo you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M\" (M&M) \"man I had one once check this out\"\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nWoke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning\nGotta get to the recording studio\nI gotta get a take done\nPut all my rhymes together so I can make one\nGet outta bed, fall on my head\nSlipped on the rug, I thought I was dead\nCussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing\nOnly a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground\nLook around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?\nThey were just there last night on the chair\nHad to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere\nGo to the basement might of misplaced em\nGotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry\nGoin' down the stairs what could happen next\nBut, when its this early you can't skip steps;\nFallin head first -- As I fall, I curse\nThings are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;\nAching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly\nWiped all the dirt off memory lapse\nI can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse\nIf you forget the whole thing pause for a second\nWhat was I looking for? Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets\nThey might be on the floor or on the chair\nWait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement\nDamn, how does time fly? Think for a second\nRecord my memory if I were a rhyme sheet where would I be??\nNow I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket\nSo I woulda never lost em\nAlready seven, I've only got an hour to eat breakfast\nGet dressed, plus take a shower got undressed\nGot the zest off the rack\nTurn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;\nCold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower\nAnd said fuck it, I'll smell\nGrabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed\nStill had to eat but my hair was a mess\nI was in a rush, grabbed the brush\nAnd ran into the door on the floor I land\nAlways to fate now; I know I'm cursed\nI think it might help if I open the door first\nTried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist\nBut that's what happens on a day like this...\n\n[Hook]\nSometimes things just never go my way\nYou know I'm just feelin' like a pooh butt today\n\n[Break]\n(Chaos Kid): Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me\n\n(M&M): Now, I'm gonna break it downfor those who don't know what a pooh butt day is\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nNow, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had\nNo particular depression neither mad or sad\nYou couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is\nCause when your feeling like a pooh butt\nThen you're feeling like shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd0f4cddbc4d708981ab71d3eb8e1e7a.640x480x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
