Well fuck it, I'm the high guy\nFrom Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye\nAnd your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing\nAnd when Jake come, I'm leaving\n\n[Biggie smalls]\n(Verse2)\nWhen we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths\nJust in case Dread want to riff\nHe get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very\nNot your ordinary: we watch you get buried\nThat's a real nigga for ya\nGet mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer\nSpit at the DA, cause fuck what she say\nShe don't give a fuck about your ass anyway\nBack up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick\nAnd kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get\nWith the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees\nSmokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's\nHitting buckshots at niggas that open spots\nOn the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you\nPimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos\nFlash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose\nDamn, a nigga's style is unorthodox\nGrip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks\nJust in case a nigga want to act out\nI just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out\nThat's a real nigga for ya\n\n[2pac]\n(Verse3)\nIm stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me\nI'd be out on bail, If I had a good attorney\nWanna label me a criminal and cuff me up\nGot a pocket full of money so they rough me up\nI ain't trippin' in the county and im mad as fuck\nGot a record so they put me with the baddest bunch\nEverybody wanna talk cause im rappin'\nThey asking me what happend\nIs it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?\nI can't sleep they taking polaroids\nAnd im tryna' use the phone but they making noise\nMan I wish I had my Glock cause its major\nIm making shanks out the plastics in razors\nThese motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word\n'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder\nIm making collect calls to my old bitches\nSend mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches\nTo all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up\nBe prepared to be socked up\nCause the game is deep, and the fame is brief\nAnd you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me\nI came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell\nIm a thug I was raised in jail, now im out on bail", "image": "https://images.genius.com/accf2df97375292b16f399ff6ec71e6e.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
