I rely on that constant communication with my higher power, more so than anybody these days. And I realized, that's kinda all I need. And then, of course, y'all appear, right, y'all appear, things appear, and situations appear. And I realize, that's God working through me, if I allow myself to be that vessel.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ea668c903da567bb7c9de7dda4c7b81.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
