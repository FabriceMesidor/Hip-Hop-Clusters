Nigga, no one\nThey bigging you up but you low down\nAnimated acting frozen\nI got porno pics, wish I can post them\nStackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em\nNiggas askin' for the old him\nBut I'm way too young to be the old him\nI'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom\n'Til I climb to the top of the podium\nSo wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga\nNiggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm\nMight gotta rake up a nigga\nI'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic\nI might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish\nWe gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world\nWe gon' rule the world, hmm\nNever gonna stop, never gonna stop\nNever ever gonna stop it\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nLa Flame says \"Let your ambition carry you\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/937ebfe41ce59f14c6ecff9976182911.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
