Scarface]\nGotta be careful who you trusting\nBe aware of your surrounding when you hustling\nThem niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg\nAll the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all\nYou fuck with dude, he your day one\nAlmost had it all then the day comes\nWhen they walking through your house with the strap out\nPointing at your head, got the bread then you black out\n(yeah)\nBright lights down the hallways\nLeft his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)\nThey say that every doors got a day coming\nIt's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing\nEyes wide shut like you looking at me\nWindow pain to the soul say they niggas happy\nBut the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach\nThe homie didn't keep it one hundred\nThe cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect\nFinally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)\nFor money, niggas murder what they close to\n(get this nigga)\nEntire families these mother fuckin' ghost you\nSmoke you, was it worth what the life was?\nJust prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz\nWas it worth what that life was?\nPrepare for the payback when it strikes cuz\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nCuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around\nCold world, cold world\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nYo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable\nHe fuck around jump of a building if you dare him to\nThe greats they done already killed him\nWho you compare him to\nFigure out what he said will take a year or two\nFamily over everything, skills over politics\nHe don't need the accolades\nAs long as you acknowledge it\nJust playing the hand you was dealt, no aces\nBetrayal is worse than death in most cases\nThe world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist\nMultiple shots to the face, No chasers\nMad cause you blew up quick and you excited\nYour man that you grew up with get you indicted\nThis was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go\nFound out at the trial they got audio and video\nShit don't always happen how you plan it\nGet jammed up and really find out who your fam is\nYou could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas\nThat nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas\nYou know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure\nYou front tryna hold it in, it hurts more\nHe was right there back-to-back with me, my first war\nEven had a crack spot together, the first floor\nUsed to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door\nThat was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour\nFriendship was worth more than a couple of ounces\nHe was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers\nInstead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains\nTalking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting\nNothing but old pictures of old sixes\nOld BM's with the kids, old snitches\nTwo sides, both wishes\nKarma is the sister of life, they both bitches\n\n[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]\nSee there's a story in my life\nThere's a story in my pain\nThere's a story in my tears, ohh-ohh ohh\nThere's a story in me\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nYeah, for life\nLord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends\nAnd I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends\nCause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance\nHomie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me\nTake the stand, damn\nSay loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told\nI don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile\nKnew him since a child, man this game so foul\nBut niggas made vows to a code I never break\nRidin' in the heavy weight\nThirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight\nNever on time, when I show up I be ready late\nNiggas got fat while we starved they already ate\nAnd I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full\nIf he got the money we attack him like a pitbull\nWe sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store\nOn my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for\nHah!\n\n[Bridge: Akon]\nMy pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)\nAll the success that I'm suffering from\nCame from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)\nMy family fucks with me\nAnd fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)\nThat's why I don't trust nobody\nAnd I doubt you'll ever see that day\n'Fore I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you\n(surrender)\nSurrender to you, surrender to you\nWhich I will never do\n\n[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]\nCause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around\n(nobody's around)\nCold world (cold world), cold world (mm, yes it is, yeah)\nAnd the ones that you keep close\nAre the ones will take you down (always take you down)\nCold world (coold), a cold cold world\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you\n(surrender)\nSurrender to you, surrender to you\n'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you\n(surrender)\nSurrender to you, surrender to you\nWhich I will never do\nOhh-ohhohhwhooa\nOhh-ohh (ohh-ohh) ohh-ohh\n\n[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & John Legend]\nSee there's a story in my life (Surrender)\nThere's a story in my pain (Surrender)\nThere's a story in my tears (Surrender)\nThere's a story in me\n(I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6929169de7116d41676151bdea5cc773.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist":
