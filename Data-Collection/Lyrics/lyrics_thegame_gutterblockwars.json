Tell her I got plenty\nI'm in that cherry red Chevy right outside Denny's\nYou know me, lowkey\nWindow cracked and he blowin' that Ashton Kutch\nLike he macked Demi\nYou gun talkin'? See that black semi\nBlood spillin' blood on them black pennys nigga that's gutter\n\n[Hook]\nGutter, gutter\nNigga that's gutter\nGutter, gutter\nKeep it gutter\n\n[Verse 2]\nGuess that's my mind frame\nNiggas can't kill me cause they ain't tryna find Game\nEven if they was I'm at the Staples, Louis Vuitton frames\nFeet on the wood, nigga I could trip Lebron James\nI keep it hood\nBandana with that bang bang\nRed rag .45, that's the same thing\nI take the same route home in the same lane\nSame car, same nigga, just the fame changed\nI walk around like I never heard the same Game\nWatch Menace 2 Society became Caine\nThen I became king leader of the chain gang\nStill park my Rolls Royce and hop back on the same train\nThen hop out on the same street\nWhere the dealers and the fiends eat\nWhere the killers and the everything in-between meet\nGet your face covered with that white sheet\nThat nigga died over Twitter beef\nTryna keep it gutter\n\n[Hook]\nTryna keep it gutter\nKeep it gutter\nTryna keep it gutter\nGutter, gutter\nNigga that's gutter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3f4fc097719794050d92c29bcdec825.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
