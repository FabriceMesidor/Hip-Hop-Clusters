What's mine is yours\nWhat's yours is mine and I'm down for, we ridin' for it\nWe wanted this a long time ago, what you waitin' for?\nGoddamn, you let me down again (way to go)\n\n[Bridge: Snoh Aalegra]\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nAnd I ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nThis sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go\nThis the end of the road\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nAnd I ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nThis sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go\nThis the end of the road\nI got pain in my soul, way to go\nTa-ta ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh why-y-y-y\nI ain't prayed in so long, way to go\nSinnin' can't save me no more, no more\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace\n\n[Brief Message]\nMan, think about a little baby girl and a baby boy\nMan makes them happy, to carry, to carry heavy load\nWhoooooa", "image": "https://images.genius.com/895cf32a9779b29f3e18b6c7cb55b3e2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
