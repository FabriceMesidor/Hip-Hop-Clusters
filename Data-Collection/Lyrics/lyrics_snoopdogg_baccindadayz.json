'Cause beef is in the kitchen\nWhat you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission\nHow can you get it if you ain't been through shit?\nI'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless\nMy family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC\nCrybaby, used to C-Walk at the park\nPitbulls on a leash that would never bark\nReal love, real dubs, real 'saniacs\nTrip Locc, kinfolk, and Wayniac\nPeace to the deceased that passed away\n\"Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way\"\nWhat you gon' do\nWhen we pull up in a hood near you?\nYou know\n\n[Chorus]\nI used to come through with the tools and Glocks\nParty don't rock like it used to rock\nBack door, nigga, I refuse to knock\nI beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks\nI used to come through with the tools and Glocks\nParty don't rock like it used to rock\nBack door, nigga, I refuse to knock\nI beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, certified official gangsta shit\nUnfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga\nDetrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls\nIt's either hog status or buster status\nIt ain't no in betweens\nYou can't wake up and put this on, nigga\nEvery breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit\nClappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches\nMansion business and stackin riches\nIt's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow\nGs up, forever\nThe boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side", "image": "https://images.genius.com/60bf707949edab977c5ad8da61ef82a2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
