Why'd you have to take her from me?\nI guess He needed your angel face for all of heaven to see\nYour picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary\nI swear, I still ain't looked at your obituary\nSo now I'm so doped up, I think I'm flyin'\nI hope the spliff'll never finish\nI guess the Mayans wasn't lyin'\n2012, my world ended\nYou used to say that I could see the future\nYou was wrong, 'cause you was in it\nAnd I was just with you the day before\nYou said you loved me, I said I loved you more\nAnd as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu\nAnd fall off a fucking tower tryna find you\nI gotta stay 'cause I remember that day\nI looked you in the face and told you\n\"Nothing can stop me, not even you\"\nStick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot\nIf reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost\nEven if you forget me and everything you left behind\nI never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time\nI close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud\nWe never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about\nI ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme\nSigned, sincerely yours, I live to let you...\n\n[Interlude: BJ The Chicago Kid & Ab-Soul]\nDot-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da\nShine\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nEverything I love the most gets taken away\nMy momma and music is next\nAnd if that happens before I turn 28\nThen I'm going out with Kurt Cobain\nI still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke\nUnless we talkin' symbolically, then I might agree\nBut if you really wanna look at it that way\nThen, ayy, man, God don't like me\nI refuse to believe that, but what's acceptable\nIs anything's possible, but nobody's special\nMy ma took my TV, Clem took my radio\nNow I'm on TV and on the radio\nDon't be dethroned by these systems of control\nJust keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul\nDon't be dethroned by these systems of control\nJust keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul\n\n[Outro]\n(Soul!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36147c3e9b6fcfa747233bb1c340f424.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
