Oh my God\n[Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him\n[Nurse] Oh my God\n\n[Verse 1]\nThese are the results of a thousand electric volts\nA neck with bolts\n(Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse)\nA kid who refused to respect adults\nWore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose\nA corny looking White boy\nScrawny and always ornery\nCause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me\nAnd I might snap, one day just like that\nI decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack\nMy first day in junior high this kid said\nIt's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die\nI looked at my watch it was 1:20\nI already gave you my lunch money\nWhat more do you want from me\nHe said, don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse\nMy palms were sweaty\nAnd I started to shake at first\nSomething told me, try to fake a stomach ache, it works\nI screamed, oww, my appendix feels like they could burst\nTeacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse\n\"What's the matter\"\nI don't know, my leg, it hurts\n\"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy\"\nOh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee\n\"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over\nAnd just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework\"\nBut don't you wanna give me after school detention\n\"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him\"\n\n[Hook x2]\nBrain damage\nEver since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was going\nBut everywhere I go they keep playing my song", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b1c9568017c50ed4a1b0e810ff2a60c.480x360x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
