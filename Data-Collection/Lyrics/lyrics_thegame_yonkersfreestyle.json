But why think about it?\nWhy just knock it off your rocker, fuckin' drink and shout at\nWhat's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet\nSlit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music\nKeep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit\nPiss on the flag that has nurtured you\nOffend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit\nLoose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at\nCause you're the fuckin' gangster you claim to be aren't you?\nToo fuckin' dangerous and harmful for just one statement or lawsuit\nThis money and label's painted across you\nBut that's not gonna make us remorseful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e6b76fdc2635fdc0e9d62ceb9907eb3c.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
