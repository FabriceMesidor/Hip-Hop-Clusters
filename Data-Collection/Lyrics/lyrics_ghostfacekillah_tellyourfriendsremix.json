Wilin' like Stevie J chick, she sniffed a dime off me\nHeated floors, par-quet!!\nI ate her pussy while she drying off, ??? sorbet!\nStarks feeling like James Bond\nI fucked on a hundred thousand green, Draymond!\nPretty dick, back it up, hoes get they gag on\nNosebleeds, honestly, how can they just pass it up?\nI don't cum quick, uh-uh, that's them little niggas\nI fuck like my dick screwed on, go and tell them bitches", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
