Never\n'Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga you reap what you sow\nWhat goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nWhere beef could never end\nAt the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\"), you get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow\nYo it's a small world, watch what you do..
