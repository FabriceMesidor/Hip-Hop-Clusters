I made it with winter in mind\n@streetlights\n\n- Will you be my friend and can we eat Osso buco together?\n- Can you break down some of the beats on Because The Internet?\n- How much influence do you get from Kanye West?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI am def your friend if you\u2019re good with yourself and like to talk about stuff. notero LOVES my osso bucco\n@AKNC17\n\nSorry to get personal right away but people always ask basic ass questions in Q and A\u2019s so here it goes\n\nI know you were raised Jehovah\u2019s Witness but do you still follow any type of religion?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI don\u2019t really believe in religion for myself. i\u2019ve become spiritual, more at peace with things. but i don\u2019t believe in god. not like that\n@goochcrucible\n\nWhat website do you visit the most?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nRap genius\n@TheDarkKnight\n\nWhat was the meaning behind the title of \u201cClapping for the Wrong Reasons\u201d?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nIts a semi famous quote\n@Robertf\n\nDonald, can you explain the greatness of Sade\u2019s debut album \u201cDiamond Life.\u201d I would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why Sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. If you refuse to answer this question I will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of Sade\u2026.and as such you will draw my full ire\n-22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into Sade\u2019s music\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI was literally listening to sade yesterday. she\u2019s a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. I can\u2019t answer a lot of your questions about her, all i can say is she\u2019s a special artist/being\n@MaxGertler\n\nWhat does the ending of the last song symbolize? like that life can end at any second randomly?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nYou should read the \u2018because the internet\u2019 script when it\u2019s released\n@CrookedModerator\n\nIf you could trade hairlines with another person, who would it be?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nThey tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now\n\nI ain\u2019t gon sit around and front like i ain't thought about it\n\nA perfect hairline is more appealing but it\u2019s funny how\n\nMy shit is FUCKED UPPPPPPP but look how far i done got without it\n\nI keep my HALF OF AN OCTAGON hairline fucked up just to show the kids it\u2019s real\n@Kid_Kamikazee\n\nWhat did your followers realize at the end of The Biggest Troll?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nThey realize \u201cthey don\u2019t need a leader\u201d\n@Fran-Soul\n\nDude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring Africa? coz that\u2019s the only way I will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the US\n\nPliz respond\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon\n@WiggityWackWes\n\n1. There were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from Camp to Royalty to Because the Internet, do you see yourself developing a \u201csignature sound\u201d or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds?\n\n2. Your music has helped me through a lot and continues to, so I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. Thank you!\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nThanks\n\nI always wanna experiment. in everything. i\u2019ll always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored\n@RayBeach\n\nDo you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it? Kind of like 3005?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s fine, but i usually just try to touch on something that\u2019s intangible for me\n@BasedGator\n\nQuestion part: What inspires you when it comes to production? I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn\u2019t really do that on Camp. Then you got something like \u2018Zealots of Stockholm\u2019 where it gets Death Grip-ish. Is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things?\n\nSince your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha\n\nStan part: You are my role model, I can identify with your life and lyrics so well it\u2019s crazy. I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E. Cummings line in \u2018Freaks and Geeks\u2019 I was hooked. Anyway, The new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and I can\u2019t wait to see what you do in the future\n\n\n\n\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nHa. thanks\n\nI try not to think to hard about what\u2019s trap drums, what\u2019s influenced by who\u2019s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make\n@SavvyRJA\n\nIt sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nTo be honest, i don\u2019t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene\n@SavvyRJA\n\nWho is your favorite artist outside of Hip-Hop?\n\nPerosnally, Gorillaz or Red Hot Chilli Peppers\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nAnything by sam cooke\n@griffinmahon\n\nDo you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nShort films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn\u2019t take so much time. And if it\u2019s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion\n@Flowmatic\n\nWhats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI love camp. it there\u2019s little things i\u2019d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it\u2019s supposed to do\n@FlyTendencies\n\nHow do you sing so beautifully?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nThat\u2019s what you call it?\n@A1_Day\n\nDid My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus\u2019s sound play a role in Because The Internet? How big of a influence is Kanye to you?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn\u2019t for me. I can\u2019t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless\n@StefanPonce\n\nCAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE SONG TO \u201cBOY BAND\u201d ?!!!???!!!!\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\n\n@MYH\n\nHow can mirrors be real if our eyes aren\u2019t real?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nMirrors aren\u2019t real\n@Metron\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life? Did you explain the abrupt ending on Life: The Biggest Troll?\n\n(I forgot to @ before cuz I was excited)\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve missed any opportunity, honestly\n@GrizzyCreekwater\n\n3 questions :\n\n1) Favourite cartoon , what is your choice ?\n\n2) Would you ever do more stand-up shows or skits for youtube ?\n\n3) Favourite album in 2013 , from any genre ?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI really like China, IL. American Dad has the best jokes. Adventure time. Regular Show. Amazing world of gumball\n@brockemsockemz\n\nIf you were an animal, what would you be?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nKoala\n@SavvyRJA\n\nWho is your favorite philosopher?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nPatrice O'Neal and Louis CK\n@darwin_shameran\n\nYou have Andrew Auernheimer in your song, weev (Andrew) is openly known as a racist and anti-semite, how come you decided to include him?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nVideo\n@Eon2323\n\nHey Donald, big fan here (actually #1 Gambino scholar here, but nbd). I have a couple of questions\n\n1) Do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is it the same one?\n2) Are you thinking about doing another comedy special in the near future?\n3) What was your sister\u2019s reaction to your fame and come up in the rap game?\n4) Has Chevy Chase ever recited any of your lyrics or played any of your songs?\n\nThanks for just taking the time to read the questions. roscoes wetsuit\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nFirst. thanks for doing all this work for me on rap genius\n\n1) i have like 9 of these shirts\n\n2) i honestly don\u2019t know\n\n3) she\u2019s good with it. she\u2019s the best\n\n4) no.
