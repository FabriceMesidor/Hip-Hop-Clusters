You know I'm, the type of nigga that's gonna fuck a ho, send her to the store, pull off on her. You know, bitch said I had a baby on the way, I told her we gon' see on Labor Day. I ain't gonna drop a bitch off unless she stay on the spray away. Ayy, when these hoes gonna pull up for all of us? Yeah, you get what I'm saying, you wanna marry 'em, you gotta marry my niggas, fuck you mean? Tell that bitch I said shut the fuck up, sit down, and pour up\nBitch\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nPop the codeine and pour the porridge\nGot some shorties to pull up on us\nTo walk my orbit and fuck my homies\nIt's quite enormous, my dinosaurus\nYou're my tourist, come be my tourist\nI bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist\n12 at the door, flush it down the toilet\nWith dem boys, whippin' it enormous\nMy dick enormous\n\n[Verse 1: Travis Scott]\nFightin' the mood\nBreakin' the rules, howl at the moon\nYellin' my blues, wanna hit snooze\nChase it with booze\nI'm out in the noon, she out in the nude\nFightin' the fumes, it's hotter than June\nI'm under the moon followin' you\nI'm out of my head, I'm out on the road\nIt's nowhere to go, I gave you my soul\nAm I right, am I wrong?\nTryna get home\nThe love, I'm up in the hill\nMy high's as low as a hill\nHigh's as low as a hill", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
