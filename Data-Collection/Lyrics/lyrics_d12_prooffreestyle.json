Uh\nBig Proof!\n\n[Verse]\nD12, strong arm, with my gun drawn\nWith your step pop's ass in fronting on your mom's lawn\nA sick bandit, trying to kill this planet, die alone\nYou're one tired [?], your blown like a firestone\nI'm a quiet stone, when I'm high and stoned\nTrying to buy a home that makes Mariah moan\nThis battle shit, I mastered it\nSo sign your p-roll\nFor your life, only say half of it\nBastard bitch\nP, picture perfect, pulverise a pagan\nPussy, pills, pencil pass my play pen\nP's punch is powerful, precision me for [?]\nPunish pranks for practice, for P is for Proof\nHa, y'all hustled before, but not grind\nGot holes in my pockets, but never drop dimes\nMy rock sign's an ibis, our ice is deep too\nMy name is Max, and it's so nice to meet you\nI stay at Point Blank range, because I doubt your aim\nBust a $5 ass, and I count the change\nYou ain't got the Malcolm brains, just look at us start\nYou was born with no balls, I was born with no heart\n\n[Outro]\nWhat! Trouble Soon (it's on)...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ad7f2e74e0a3f8350a8e678a37d1a8fa.600x925x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
