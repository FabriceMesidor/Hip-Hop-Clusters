Dot w/ RZA laughing]\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay (Afro!)\n\n[Chorus 2X: P. Dot (RZA)]\nSo many times I had sneak up on them quicker\nWith my finger on the trigger, like\nLike I'm pulling out my sword\nThis is combat, man, this is war (Afro!)\n\n[RZA]\nBrain stained with the harbor, sword stained with the blood of martyrs\nRevenge is a never ending story, Afro who's the author\nTrying to bother, the bare site of my father\nSo I'm living today, like there's no tomorrow\nSword, inside my sheet, my heart is filled with beef\nFor all the dead souls, that I chopped into piece\nReturn, of the Afro sheen, fatal mean guillotine\nSword in my hand, I want the number one headband\n\n[P. Dot]\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay\n\n[Chorus 2X: P. Dot (RZA)]\nSo many times I had sneak up on them quicker\nWith my finger on the trigger, like\nLike I'm pulling out my sword\nThis is combat, man, this is war (Afro!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0050e4b1c52ecca6d63818331b489e2a.683x683x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
