country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nAyo, it's packed on this Rikers bus\nThe tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled\nThe life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso\nOn the streets I was invincible\nCowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew\nWhat my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer\nMother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me\nAll in front of my friends\nIn the street smile with no teeth\nI never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy\nDied in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3\nWhy didn't my folks just die in this society\nWhy wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me\nTwo little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat\nMother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me\nI'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father\nWhether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers\nBlurry visions of dad holdin' me high\nIt comes to me slowly, the words he would cry\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\n\n[Verse 2: Millennium Thug]\nIt is I that step up\nMe that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier\nHummers and Range's through the desert\nFuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water\nTroopers lookin' for manslaughter\nI gotta get back, for what they owe\nShoot 'em in the back for the get back\nLead through shit bag, hold tie gag\nForget the life had, now we all rebels\nEverything burnt down includin' the ghetto\nWe can see 4 miles the land its major rubble\nAnd debris from the earth as we knew crumble\nYo you could see the sea\nAnd the stars look closer to me\nI'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max\nS-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap\nMy mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back, but yo\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\n\n[Verse 3: Nas (Millennium Thug)]\nYo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls\nI got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God\nBrothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape\nSome brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape\nHow is the war\nAnd yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes\nHoldin' machine guns\nClean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on\nAnywhere is better than this\nIt's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit\nYo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares\nI know the warden is readin' the scribe\n(But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business)\nCourts, lawyers and jails\nWe all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel\n\n[Verse 4: Millennium Thug]\nThere's not a bitch in sight\nOr block bench, or black gate\nOr gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President\nI remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent\nNow it's state of the art\nI just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart\nWhat a bloody mess, a slug fest\nI just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'\nYou know I'm spittin' mine\nI ain't goin' out here, we gotta win\nEvery time I hear the wind I think a slug went in\nI'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head\nCatchin' my breath, watchin' my back\nSmokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass\nI don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake\nEveryday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape\nAnd if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\nMy country shitted on me (my country)\nShe wants to get rid of me (naw, never)\n'Cause the things I seen (we know too much)\n'Cause the things I seen (we seen too much)\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nThis goes out to Che Guevara;\nA Revolutionary destroyed by his country\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nThis goes out to Martin, all about peace and destroyed by his own country\nThis goes out to everybody in the whole world\nJust trying to fight for what's real\nTo Patrice Lumumba;\nJust trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people\nThis goes out to my hood niggas\nComing up everyday just trying to survive the only way we know how\nBut see we know too much now, and we seen too much now\nSo ain't nothing gon' to stop us now\nTo my country, to my country, my country, my country...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b568e8d559c7ba98ef485809d81c1d79.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
