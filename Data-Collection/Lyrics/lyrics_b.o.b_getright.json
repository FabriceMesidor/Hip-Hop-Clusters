So what, we drunk?\nAnd if we run out, it's nothin' to get more\nLivin' my life one day at a time\nTryna get right one play at a time\nYou never can predict what I'm gonna do next, No Genre\nI ain't finna stay off in a line\nIf I had it my way, I'd ball everyday\nHit the mall everyday\nGo through 100K, and put it all in the safe\nWhat the hell are celebrations for?\nDrinkin' moonshine out a mason jar\nPatron margaritas, pretty se\u00f1oritas\nBringing me everything I need like, \"Si Se\u00f1or\"\nYou could pull up to the kick back\nBut you better have a six pack or somethin'\nYou don't wanna be the one empty handed\nWhen everybody ask, \"Where the liq at?\"\nGet right\n\n[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07af9b12b2956baf31b88d2ae47697d2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
