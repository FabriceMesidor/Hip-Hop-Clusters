They don't wanna battle\nThey ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)\nListen, listen, listen\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nYour spirit AIN'T READY\nYour church AIN'T READY\nYour bishop AIN'T READY\nYour deacons AIN'T READY\nYour choir AIN'T READY\nYour ushers AIN'T READY\nAt the Temple of Hip-Hop\nWE TEACH MANY!\n\n[KRS-One]\nLook! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin\nWhat we know for sure, God is always workin\nWorkin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin\nWorkin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin\nGod is always workin, workin while you learnin\nWorkin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin\nChrist consciousness, get that, got that\nSpit that, rock that, hip that, hop that\nYou sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back\nGreedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap\nSlangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at\nI don't know that, but Jesus done copped that\nNot that man on the cross, it ain't like that\nYou must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at\nStop readin only and start bein show me\nLike the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[KRS-One]\nOne thing's for sure and believe it hurt\nIt's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church\nThey don't know God's law, and can't see God at work\nSo when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church\nLike fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit\nThey gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot\nHear the truth now, I come to enhance the light\nThey women of God, singin while they pants is tight?\nThey not hot! Really they, regular\nThey clothes they flows, all that, secular\nWhat's the difference I could stay in the world and wild\nIf these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child\nKeep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin\nBut this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian\nStop readin only and start bein show me\nLike the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me\n.. listen, listen, listen\n\n[Hook]\n\n[KRS-One]\nLook! Spiritual minded, you must find it\nFind your spirit and go deep inside it\nThis goes out to the Christians listenin\nThis is the flow that, gospel's missin it's\nUrban inspirational rap\nWe got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack\nWe respect tradition from the start\nBut we now know the true word of God is written in our heart\nWe gotta say something to the streets kid!\nAll these churches surrounding the Devil still ain't defeat it?\nThey the type to get down, I'm the type to get up\nFrom \"Criminal\" to \"Spiritual Minded\", now raise your head up\nLet me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart\nAll they want is quick money and a movie part\nLet me begin, what, where, why or when\nWhat's the use of double platinum if you're living in sin\nHear the truth, how long you think you gonna last\nRockin the mic, without having to go back to class?\nNow you're forced, to listen to the teacher out rap them\nYes there's life after platinum", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d84f73e1b21b8b4dbd679efa191364e4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
