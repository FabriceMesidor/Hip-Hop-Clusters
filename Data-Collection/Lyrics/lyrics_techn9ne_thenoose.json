Dan\nThe war, if you in it, damn, they have no remorse at any minute, Bam!\nThat's fucked off, while we chillin' on tour on the bus getting sucked off\nKnow our families grieving 'cause war is receding\nTheir peeps have been crying their butts off\nThat's why I give so much when I flow bust, why we got it so good?\nCause it's so rough, for the young soldiers who\nDo exactly what they're told to do... damn\nThrough exactly what they told to do\nDefend the country and uphold the crew\nBut give my one and only soul for U (S.A.)?\nThat's a hell of a job description, I don't know if my God's with this one\nBut I guess it's the laws of sick men\nSend out young'ns and they fall the victim\nOf an evil clan's plan, that's why I be saying \"Dwamn\"\nCause on 9/11 I realized our fate is in another man's hands\n\n[Hook]\nWhat a world, what a world\nI'm hanging up the noose now\nWaiting for the end\nWhat a world, what a world\nI'm hanging up the noose now\nWaiting for the end\n\n[Verse 3: Bernz]\nWhen I see how my loved ones have left\nI wonder how long I would fight\nI wonder if I would give in or let the reaper lead me into night?\nSee I got too much pride left, like my grandmother died too earlier\nReaching for moments more but the cancer in her lungs took her from me\nWe drift, naturally, like two ships in the roughest of seas\nThat's why this moment is precious, yet I'm too distant to feel it complete\nSee these days I feel so disconnected, it gets harder to drop to my knees\nI guess that's a side-effect of living in Generation X-Y-Z\nObsessed with pain and greed, man I wish we were kids again\nThings were simple then\n90's incidents got me losing friends to the hands of violent men\nFast, faster than speeding bullets whizzing down alleyways\nAbruptly I'm waking up from this haze\nBut only to realize the world hasn't changed\nSome of y'all not even fazed, y'all think it's the way we've been raised?\nFuck it, I'll stick him right back in his haze\nCause these could turn out to be my last today's\nWith a hope and a prayer put a rope in the air, but I'm just too scared\nChoking from the pressure when I rock this chair\nSwing back and forth and tempt Death with a blank stare\n\n[Hook]\nWhat a world, what a world\nI'm hanging up the noose now\nWaiting for the end\nWhat a world, what a world\nI'm hanging up the noose now\nWaiting for the end", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4392f3223b9e5965e7f76dc529941352.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
