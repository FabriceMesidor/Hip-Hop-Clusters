We got our own\nI'm the Divine Master of the Unknown\nAin't nothing changed, I'm the same as before\nWhen opportunity knocked I just answered the door\nCriminal at heart even though I don't show it\nI was always a winner but I just didn't know it\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/828235dd1b98a4119ad69053ed2e4192.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
