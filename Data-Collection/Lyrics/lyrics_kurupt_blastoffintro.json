You want to take a hit of this shit\nYo what's that?\nMan you want take a hit of this shit or what?\nYeah nigga. What is it?\nHere. Hit this nigga\n(Coughing and music starts)\nDAMN!\nDAMN!\n(Humming)\n\n[Verse]\nFuck you call this shit?\nThe music is different yeah? The vibrations are different. Not like planet earth. Playing\nThe very sound of guns. Anger. Frustration. There was no one to talk to from planet earth\nTo run us down. We set up a colony for black people here. So we they can do on planet on\nTheir own without any white people there. They can drink in the beauty of this planet. It\nWill effect their vibration. For the better of course. Another place in the universe. Up under\nDifferent stars. That would be where the altered destiny would come in. Equation wise\nThe first thing to do is to consider time as officially ended. We work on the other side of\nTime. We bring them here through either isotope teleportation. Transqualecuzation. Or\nBetter still teleport the whole planet here through music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music\nMusic. Music\n\n[Outro]\nSpace pretty", "image": "https://images.genius.com/32f5907a0f69c52bd9d20ec857b3f90c.944x944x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kurupt"}
