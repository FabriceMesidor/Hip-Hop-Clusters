Oh!\nShould I stay should I go? Oh!\nI don't know, I don't know\nLord please let me know\n\n[Hook]\nAnd we probably share a trait or two\nBut I can't see what I can't relate to\nHey Jesus\nWill I ever get to see you through my hazeus?\nAnd we probably share a trait or two\nBut I can't see what I can't relate to\nHey Jesus\nWill I ever get to see you through my hazeus?\n\n[Verse 3]\nEvery thing cool like in the state of mind\nThat this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect\nDeflect the corrupt with intellect\nI talk too much, the jig is up, he has risen up\nFrom a division of most kings\nWith their vision, positioned for precision\nIt's mind splitting and soul uplifting\nBut still feel so trapped in the solar system\n\n[Hook]\nAnd we probably share a trait or two\nBut I can't see what I can't relate to\nHey Jesus\nWill I ever get to see you through my hazeus?\nAnd we probably share a trait or two\nBut I can't see what I can't relate to\nHey Jesus\nWill I ever get to see you through my hazeus?\n\n[Outro]\nWill I see you through my hazeus view?\nWill I see you through my hazeus view?\nIf I see you through my hazeus view\nSee you through my hazeus view\nSee you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus\nMy hazeus, my hazeus view\nAnd I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus\nMy hazeus, my hazeus view", "image": "https://images.genius.com/314e5f2acb3d276d4b374900e64b4c42.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
