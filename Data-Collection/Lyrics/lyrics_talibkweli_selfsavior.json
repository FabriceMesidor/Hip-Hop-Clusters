Dealin with savages is damagin\nSomebody gotta lose although you play to win\nYou know these niggas hate, despite the color of your face\nWhen I say nigga I'm just speakin on your mental state\nLife ain't a game if it is I can't participate\nMaybe I've changed but my mind is in a different state\nCause now it seems more like a plan\nI'm strivin for perfection, so that's where I'll begin\nYour tallies and peaks and valleys can't describe who I am\nThis music is therapeutic, I define who I am\nThrough the actions I portray as a man - in combination\nWith impressions I leave on people through things that I've said\nI've had it up to here with the bullshit\nSo when I rap I sound like I'm in the pulpit\nYeah; they say that I be preachin too much\nBut I know that through the music's how you teach it to us\nIt's all real\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nTrue indeed Chace; they tried to get rid of me (say word)\nBut they can't write me off, I'm not a charity\nThat's a parody right? You kiddin me\nThere really ain't no challenge, my authenticity\nVirtually guarantee me a flawless victory, you kiddin me?\nI'm lethal, I'm from a people who was forced into captivity\nOriginal man, there was often a facsimile\nI give a little more than your metaphors and wack similes\nThousand yard stare, say a prayer for my enemy\nI'm international, half of these rappers laughable\nIt's tragic how the other half so vaginal\nThey put the style over substance, they counsel bother me\nMy style married my substance and now they livin in harmony\nBut any substance can be abused\nEspecially when the style is so seductive the substance consider leaving you\nYou gotta get back to your essence\nUse your gifts and share your presence\nDon't count your dollars 'til you count your blessings\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/195bc58c1487ceee38b62b9e3ae90bdb.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
