But now the only 2 relative questions is\nDo we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?\nEither way, you up out of here for good\nNow when niggas mention you name\nThey knockin' on wood, did I get my point across?\nAnother body on the shotte, another joint I toss\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nThere ain't no sunshine\nWhen the Dark Man comes out\nAnd I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out\nWe got four 9's so niggas run in and run out\nBut I bust mine 'cause I'd like to hear some shots\nGet at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy\nWhen it comes to that flow, I gets busy\nWho is he? Dark Man of the unknown\nOne dog, one bone\nNow who ain't goin' home? Looks like you\nYou hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2\nWon't be a strike 3 'cause I don't play fair\nI'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear\nBe like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'\nThe Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'\nYou was ballin' a minute ago in it for dough\nTill it was, \u00e2\u20ac\u00bdYo, I swear to God, I didn't know\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\nOnly darkness every day\nAin't no sunshine when it's on\n'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone\nEvery time 'cause we don't play\nAnd I know, I know, I know, I know, I know\nWhatchu think you gon get?\nFuck around with my dough\nJust so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show\nOne\n(One)\nTwo\n(Two)\nThree\n(Three)\nHere I go\nYour shit is quick and your shit is sleek\nBut this shit is thick and when you hear this shit\nDamn right I can finish shit\nIf you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine\nBut you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind\nTap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around\nHit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground\nBe like, \"Damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash\"\nLife is good so please enjoy it while it lasts\n'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go\nThe quicker you go depends the stronger the flow\nWhen niggas know I don't give a fuck, right or wrong\nThere ain't no sunshine when it's on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
