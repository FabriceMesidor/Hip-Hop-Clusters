But I don't know what's cookin'\n\nThey say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me\nIf they can't understand it, how can they reach me?\nI guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front\nThat's why I know my life is out of luck, fool\n\nBeen spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\nKeep spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\nBeen spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\nKeep spending most our lives\nLiving in a gangsta's paradise\n\nTell me why are we so blind to see\nThat the ones we hurt are you and me?\nTell me why are we so blind to see\nThat the ones we hurt are you and me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/80e7d4d7290ea57cc76b3c5e101a8d2f.755x755x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
