Ice Cube is here to drop you a note\nCause some of our folk used to hang from ropes\nAnd some of our people used to hang from trees\nNow the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ\nSo, get your mind right, and I'mma rhyme right\nFuck the limelight, and a blind dyke\nI'm the sunlight, too bright to look\nWhen it's all said and done I should write the book\nYou too cool for school, too old to know?\nGet your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow\nI understand, it ain't no love lost\nBut little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nYeah, f'real\nI was born in the mud but I came out clean\nThat's 'til the government tried to intervene\nTried to lock me up when I was only 19\nDon't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream\nI make shit raw that piss off the law\nIf you want some fake shit turn this off\nIf you want some realness I know you can feel this\nMaybe we can heal this just like an illness\nBlack on black, I got'cho back\nPeople don't think that we know how to act\nJust because our neighborhood is filled with crack\nAnd the CIA, won't take it back\nNever on top, always on the bottom\nNever put your trust in Hillary Rodham\nCause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten\nKeep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nStand up, f'real...\nRaise your hand if you sick of this bullshit\nHeh, in the belly of the evil empire {*fades*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/284f4145950de6c7f91a598379e2bb40.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
