Kish, smokin' on that Keisha\nI'ma need that visa\nI'm working on everything that I'm touching man\nI'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves\nBut it's still ain't nothing yo\nIt's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale\nSo fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me, good\nPut that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would\nI say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood\nI'm in my zone though, fucking 'round with that 4-0\nEating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto\nGirl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any\nMan, I'm trying to stay off, readin' 'em makes me angry\nOn the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us\nStacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us\nTrying to make amends, bailing on all my friends\nNiggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead\nMan I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yellin', \"Don't stop\"\nAnd half my crew is always faded on some low top\nStopped drinking for the most part\nMy only vices all our pictures on my laptop\nScreaming at me saying, \"I ain't what you really want\"\nChristina's parents baby all I make is Milians\nWe got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect\nSo tell them haters we ain't quitting yet\nLet 'em know\n\n[Chorus]\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne love, the thing that hasn't changed\nMy parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A\nNow that I'm one percent, I send most of it home\nI want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans\nAnd everybody saying, \"Get it while you hitting man\nWe want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man\"\nDude is so stupid popping anything they hand me\nOn that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami\nIn that home of the D where they sell that cake batter\nHeard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers\nThat I shitted on, shitted on\nShitted on, shitted on\nRap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze\nShow 'em A-Town, East Side, all day\nI put it on, I put it on\nI put it on, I put it on\nLife is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax\nI ain't even started, was it stupid I departed?\nMan, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted\nI'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with\nPlease somebody cum laude me\nGraduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me\nNot a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List\nBut most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress\nJesus\n\n[Chorus]\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nOne love\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out\nYou can let it out, cause\nI shoulda known, shoulda known\nI shoulda known, shoulda known", "image": "https://images.genius.com/587833871590a682c8aed1b739f0cb23.906x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
