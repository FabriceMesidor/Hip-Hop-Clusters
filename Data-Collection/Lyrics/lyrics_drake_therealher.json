Lipstick on the glass\nI know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last; Tunechi\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nYou musta done this before, this can't be your first time\nWe musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind\nYou got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find\nYou musta done this before, this can't be your first time\n\n[Verse 4: Andre 3000]\nShower her with dollar tips\nShawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name\nYou throw the ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote \"bad bitches\" work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in the corner\nLike a lab rat nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind\nCause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in the Boise state\nCan't see her play or the team, cuz\nEverybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't\nSouls will later on say to them \"that ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what y'all can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you baby\nSomeone like you, more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy\nOh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy\nPlease be careful: bitches got the rabies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50b0608affc94c4dae3d502a65ea390.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
