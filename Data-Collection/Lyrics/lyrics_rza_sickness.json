Allah U Akbar\nI turn the most degenerate hood into a pop star\nBless the seed who prays the Most High, without askin' why\nFlicks from ocean shore, kick like Marshall Law\nI might strike with the eagle claw or tiger paw\nOn the shores of African beach, facin' the east\nWhite sands stretched out as far as the eye can see\nFound buried by the sea\nThe heat of Allah son will crack through Antarctica\nWe ride blue whales, you sell Nautica ships on the carpenter\nWe should send all these Devils back to Hell\nYou small as to die in my sentence, I speak with vengeance\nSnatch up 17 million plus 2 million Indians\nYour incorrect retrospect on the situation\nYou didn't know it was a Wu-Tang affiliation\nLegs weak like twigs, you're forbidden like pig\nYou can't fuck with the Zig-Zag-Zig\n\n[Break: RZA]\nRaise your sword, and praise the Lord\nAnd wage war on this wicked society\nRaise your sword, and praise the Lord\nAnd wage war on this wicked society\n\n[RZA]\nThe village must be pillaged\nThe merciless, the Earth is damp from blood spillage\nCursed the ancestors and the seed of the assailant\nDissect his body like an alien\nMy seed must be spread\nI bust sperm cells with Bobsleds\nThen race to the egg and bring forth the\nArm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head\nAll you niggas out there who got money\nBetter watch out for the money hungry\nStraight up...\nThe most beloved from a region undiscovered\nI've been hovered over by black buzzard walkin' through public\nImagine the feelin' of growin' up, ten children\nStuffed inside a shack, in the project buildings\nWomen, infants and coupons, one stole Campbell's soup on\nStressed out with four kids, aborter\nNext door the dope fiend neighbour tryin' to sell his little daughter\nPoisonous, heat from the oven\nThe only way we had to live was survivin' off mommy's lovin'\nDead bodies found in the incinerator\nLights Out, somebody fucked up the generator\nTalkin' welfare, cheese, franks and beans\nMud stains on mock-neck shirts and tainted jeans\nTwisted up, how the fuck we get bended up?\nAnd ended up in this four block radius where they enslaved us\nSweatin' from cheese ravioli with tomato sauce and anchovie\nSpoiled, ah shit, my blood boiled\nBut fuck that, I'm ready for open hand combat\nIt's the tomcat, and my thoughts are unlimited\nInflicted fatal wounds and I'm immune, to your evil society\n\n[Break: RZA]\nSo praise the Lord and and wage war\nAgainst this wicked society, society\nPraise the Lord and raise your sword\nAgainst this wicked society, society\nPraise the Lord and raise your sword\nAgainst this wicked society\n\n[RZA]\nThere was a Legend of a Liquid Sword\nThat was Only Built 4 Niggas with Cuban Linx\nWho +Entered the 36th Chamber+\nAnd keep the true links, inherit +The W+ emblem\nMovin' the muscle changin' and bone tendon bendin'\nScience of 25 thousand year millennium\nThe sinners from the men who exiled the Indians from India\nWho's times can't be measured linear\nIn all tribes on Earth who can't find a friendlier group of people\nWho shunt all evil, treat all men equal\nEven though we see through your wicked intentions\nWe gave you land to experiment with your inventions\nBut you strive for global lynchin', extension\nBut it's yourself that will become extinct\nYou inherit this power to think and build things\nThe free will to love, not hate or kill things\nAnd when you went astray, we sent prophets to reveal things\nAnd left scriptures behind to fulfill things\nBut you still wanna kill things, rob and steal things\nSo don't blame us when it's time to fulfill things and kill Kings\n\n[Break: RZA]\nRaise the sword and praise the Lord\nOn this wicked society, society\nRaise your sword and praise the Lord\nIt's a wicked society, society\nPraise the Lord and raise your sword\nAgainst this wicked society\nWage war\nAgainst this wicked society\n\n[Outro: RZA]\nYo, the +Sickness+\nThat's what I want\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\"Man with no mother\"\nThat's what I want\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\"Man with no mother\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52be3befc1392598c2d27e30b8059858.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
