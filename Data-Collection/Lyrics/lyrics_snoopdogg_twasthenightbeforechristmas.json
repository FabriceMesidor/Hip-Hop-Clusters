Did you bring me some chronic?\"\nAnd Tanqueray gin I can mix with my tonic?\nHe said \"ho, ho, ho\" and opened his sack\nIt was stuffed full of indo, had to take a step back\n\"Is this for the Dogg? Did you bring this for me?\nTo blaze with my hoes and my closest homies?\"\nHe just nodded his head, his eyes about shut\nIt was then that I knew that Saint Nick was fucked up\nHe ate all my motherfuckin' cookies\nI left on the plate\nThen he went to the fridge\nAnd he ate, and he ate, and that fat motherfucka ate\nAnd when he was done\nWhen the cupboard was bare\nHe packed his shit up and got outta there\n\"Good night Doggy Dogg!\" he said from the sky\n\"Merry Christmas to all you motherfuckers\nAnd to all a good high\"\nMerry Christmas\nFrom the Dogg Pound\nAnd everybody have a happy new year, ho ho ho\n(laughter)\n(Why you laugh, dog?)\n(You made a nigga laugh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e00df0a8dfdae29f5a3d1ad41324e546.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
