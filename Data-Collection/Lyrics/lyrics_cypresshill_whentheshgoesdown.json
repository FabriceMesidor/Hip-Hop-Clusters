I think I got one to tha chest\nHot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit\nI still stand tall with tha hill clan y'all better stand back\nNiggas bout ta fall I'm comin' out blastin' like Yosemite\nSam get tha cheese an tha bread for tha ham\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready (when tha shit goes down)\nWhen tha shit goes down ya better be ready (ya better be ready)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2615919eb0bcef9d55421080ab3b10b1.860x860x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
