Drrtt!\u2014that's all that happened\n\n[Hook]\nBlast off, blast off\nBlast off, blast off\nLift off, lift off, lift off\nSaid I'm 'bout to lift off\nLift off, L.A. Leakers lift off\nLift off, said we 'bout to lift off\n\n[Verse 2]\nHol' up! These rap niggas be actin' up\nTalk mad shit, can't back it up\nDon't let me catch you lackin'\nI pack you inside the Maxima\nMark them days on the calendar\nDon't you dare dodge this challenger\nSonics is hedge-hodgin'\nGot heads boppin' way out in Africa\nRadios be lackin' though\nYou can't front on talents so\nI'ma kill like every show and any foe and any flow\nNo flex when I be in the zone\nKnow to watch when I come on\nI check-in in the microphone\nCollect this check then I'm headin' home\nBut it ain't always been like this\n'Member when we was broke as shit\nSavin' L's 'til next week\nMy ashtray still got a roach in it\nI hit it until my finger tips\nGet burnt at the filter tip\n'Fore I learn to take a risk, I ain't even had a pot to piss in\nListen, I'm twistin' the system\nThe mission, the recognition\nI see the future clearly: my premonitions is scary\nPray that they bury me\nWhere my soul has been heavenly sent\nFor the fathers and martyrs of this art that we formin'\nWe call it hip hop\nNigga, guess you must've forgot", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1eec180859a1269f6fae60821ba3df8b.600x576x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
