I see the penitentiary, one day\nAnd runnin from the police, that's right\nMama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside\nAnd even as a crack fiend, mama\nYou always was a black queen, mama\nI finally understand\nFor a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man\nYou always was committed\nA poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it\nThere's no way I can pay you back\nBut the plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n\n[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac]\nDear mama\nDon't you know I love you?\nDear mama\nPlace no one above you\n(Dear mama)\nOh mama, I appreciate you\nAlthough my shadow's gone\nI will never leave you\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nNow ain't nobody tell us it was fair\nNo love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there\nHe passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger\nWouldn't let me feel for a stranger\nThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along\nI was lookin for a father he was gone\nI hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs\nThey showed a young brother love\nI moved out and started really hangin\nI needed money of my own so I started slangin\nI ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks\nIt feels good puttin money in your mailbox\nI love payin rent when the rent's due\nI hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you\nCause when I was low you was there for me\nAnd never left me alone because you cared for me\nAnd I could see you comin home after work late\nYou're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate\nYa just workin with the scraps you was given\nAnd mama made miracles every Thanksgiving\nBut now the road got rough, you're alone\nYou're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n\n[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac]\nDear mama\nDon't you know I love you?\nDear mama\nPlace no one above you\n(And dear mama)\nOh mama, I appreciate you\nAlthough my shadow's gone\nI will never leave you\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nPour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama\nI can always depend on my mama\nAnd when it seems that I'm hopeless\nYou say the words that can get me back in focus\nWhen I was sick as a little kid\nTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did\nAnd all my childhood memories\nAre full of all the sweet things you did for me\nAnd even though I act crazy\nI gotta thank the Lord that you made me\nThere are no words that can express how I feel\nYou never kept a secret, always stayed real\nAnd I appreciate, how you raised me\nAnd all the extra love that you gave me\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\n\n[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & 2Pac]\nDear mama\nDon't you know I love you?\nDear mama\nPlace no one above you\n(Dear mama)\nOh mama, I appreciate you\nAlthough my shadow's gone\nI will never leave you\n\n[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]\nI appreciate you\nI love you\nI need you\nOh mama\nI love you\nAppreciate you\nI need you\nOh mama\n*fading away*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c328858b46d66b811fbf74b664cd14a9.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
