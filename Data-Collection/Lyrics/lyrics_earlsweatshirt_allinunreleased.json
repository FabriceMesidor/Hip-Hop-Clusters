I'm eating regardless\nI had a prayer up with different gods\nI know the tapestry is enormous\nPatchin' a straw in it\nI know the path battle with darkness\nI hold a match up and take it all in\n\n[Hook]\nPatchin' a straw in it\nI know the path battle with darkness\nI hold a match up and take it all in\nI'm all in\nYeah, I'm all in\nAll in\nAll in\nAll in\nYeah, I'm all in\nI hold a match up and take it all in", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abe116b40a921476ff1094726c8d1a8.608x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
