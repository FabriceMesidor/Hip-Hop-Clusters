The freaking has just begun\nWe hit fifty more positions before I got done\nWhen we've got finished, it was no longer dark\nWe had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark\nThen she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye\nAnd said these words to my surprise\nShe said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could\nI came here with you, cause I thought I should\nI tried to freak you, cause I thought I could\nBut oohh baby, you sure are good\nShe said: baby you're one hell of a man\nAin't no better riding than Disney Land\nNow to all you ladies that think you're fly\nAnd can out freak the average guy\nDon't ever come venturing through my door\nI'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more\nYo, please check it out\nAll the ladies in the house come check it out\n'Cause I'm a player with jewels on every hand\nSo deeply in pocket I control demand\nBut we all know how I earn my pay\n'Cause you don't wanna work, when you got to play\n\n[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]\n\n[Verse 6: Ice-T]\nBrothers when you wine and dine a fox\nYou don't take her to McDonalds or to Jack In The Box\nDon't pick her up, in a bus or a cab\nShe needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap\nYou can take her to dine at the finest spot\nOr you take her to a disco that's really hot\nYou can take her home and while you're all alone\nDon't forget to disconnect the phone\nYou can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets\nRock her butt to the rhythm of the beat...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/612b351ffec24338e85a86aa57e094bf.600x598x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
