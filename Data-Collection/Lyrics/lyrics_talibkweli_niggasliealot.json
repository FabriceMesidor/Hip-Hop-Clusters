It's entertainment\nIt's very entertaining, you know what I'm sayin'?\nBut if you just listenin' - if you a fan, a spectator, a tourist\nAnd you just takin' a tour through this world\nDon't rep it like you really doin' it, because it could come back to haunt you, y'know?\nNiggas lie a lot, man\nDo not believe a word these niggas is sayin'\nThey are just cariacatures in the cells\nIt's not really real, it's just television, it's two-dimension\nTalib Kweli, Blacksmith is the revolution\nWe are three-motherfuckin'-D\nYeah", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/talib-pic.png"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
