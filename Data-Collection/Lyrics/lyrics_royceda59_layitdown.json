(Karma side, karma-karma side)\n\n[Royce Da 5'9\"]\nYeah, I done shot a couple tools, I done got a couple fools\nIn a lot of scuffles in war, I got a couple wounds\nI've learned not to play it just to play it just to burn\nI've learned not to say it, just return\nBetter spray it, let the metal blow\nI ain't never scared but I'm way too paranoid to let it go\nThat's why you can find me in your bushes with them blammers\nSeein footsteps from your grandma, ready pullin back them hammers\nI ride cause I'm skinny\nSomebody 'bout to treat me like I'm Santa when I slide down your chimney\nWith them semi-automatics or the Deserts with the heads\nWith the hollows in the bag like a present for the kids\nWith the mask and the beard and the belly, who you red\nLeave you dead, witnesses lookin like it ain't no tellin who it is\nI'mma ride, I ain't tryin other ways\nI'mma kill just to live just to die another day, hey\n\nO.P., I'm from O.P.!

I'm a gangsta for real\nIf I feel you a threat I make you pay me to live\nRoyce hit me on that Nex' I send a gang to your crib\nWith a pack of killer pitts, let 'em play with your kids\nNo slice, no bangs, just bikes and shanks\nHit that red rum down, you won't like the taste\nYou shouldn't be playin all wild when your life at stake\nI get your man gunned down for his shiesty eighth\nMan it's the whole rundown dawg, I'm like a eight\nStreet Lord gorilla fam take your life away\nWhat?
