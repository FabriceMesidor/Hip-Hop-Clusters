Cole J. Cole\nAy, fresher than a day old newborn, bitches blowing kisses\nThat's the same ho that you on\nI knew her back in high-school, but heard she failed college\nShe blew me like she blew her nail polish\nThat's knowledge if I ever seen it\nSay I'mma call her, but don't ever mean it\nSee I'm preoccupied, watch how my stock arise\nShe want the time and that's just something I cannot provide\nCause time is money and I, I ain't no dummy and I\nI'm trying get paid, man I gotta stay brave Atlanta\nI let your misses sip me, I ain't talking David Banner, ain't a planner\nSo if it's random then it's naturally\nName a motherfucker out here matching me\n\n[Outro]\nNigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good\nNigga I'm feeling good, nigga I'm feeling good\nNigga I'm feeling good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cd936e786e1ab454043327d585c7702.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
