(x2)\n\nVerse 4:(Rap)\nHey yo yo yo\nI asked you to calm down\nAsked you who was on the phone\nPut the horn down\nHad a glass of wine\nFrom a 99 yeah a green one\nWhich i bought for you from the cruise you won\nI dun approve of those male friends\nI told you back then when we first got together\nThat i don't trust those men\nAnd you did it again\nI lost my temper\nBlinked out and wrecked the house boo\nThats all i remember i'm sorry (sorry Sorry)\n\nChorus:\nI can't fall down on my knees\nAnd apologize to you\nCause that not in my style(x4)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
