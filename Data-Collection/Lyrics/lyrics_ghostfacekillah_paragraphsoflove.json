Not to be rude\nBut if it means anything, I can get you some food\nCheese crackers, in the back there's saut\u00e9ed shrimp\n\n[Estelle]\nNah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp\nSee my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary\nIt's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married\nAnd I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nTone Starks\n\n[Estelle]\nPeace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waitin'\n\n[Ghostface Killah]\nBut before I go, can I give you one last statement\nYou the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen\nAnd I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care\n\n[Refrain: Vaughn Anthony & Estelle]\nAny other day, I would of just let you, pass me by\nCuz I see you got situations\nAnd I've got mine, but baby its OK\nIt's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by\nCuz this was love at first sight\nCuz this was love at first sight\nIt's OK\n\n[Vaughn Anthony]\nYou can tell he must be on a mission\nBecause my heart has made it's decision\nAs soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision\nI fell in love, sweet love\nAnd no infatuated 3D glasses to see\nThat your the one I need\nAnd the situation don't matter to me\nCuz this is love, it gotta be love\nLove at first sight\n\n[Refrain 2X]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea54fa933d61e534fbf14d9509cc7146.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
