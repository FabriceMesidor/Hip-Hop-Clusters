The teachers and cooks and the drop-outs too. Word on the street is they looking for you\u2026\n\nHey Moneyman they saying whats the score? And how much blood have you spilled on the butcher shop floor? Those numbers keep running but what they running into? The crowd is outside and they asking of you\u2026\n\nHey Moneyman Moneyman the mayors' on the phone. He says he wants to know if all those people went home. Those momma's and poppa's and students and cooks. Those teachers and preachers, one second I'll look\u2026\n\nHey Moneyman Moneyman the tents are still up, the songs are still singing and the coffee's in cups. The nights due to fall and the sun's going down but its still a whole mess of good folks hanging round...\n\nThey eyes are wide and their voices are loud. Its white and black and colorless proud. The signs are big and the smiles are bright. By heaven I reckon its gone be one hell of a night!\n\nHey Moneyman poor Moneyman you should slip out the back. Cuz the forces of greed are under attack. No bombs or bullets or rocks or guns. Just hashtag's and voices at the tops of their lungs!\n\nAnd Moneyman Moneyman I won't need a ride. But if you need me\u2026\n\nYou can find me outside!\n\nBy Wasalu \"Lupe Fiasco\" Jaco\n#OccupyWallStreet", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
