homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nUh, yeah!, my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nWestside, westside\nPart two of the war\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nCross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?\nAin't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here\nMy last foe flashed and I mashed his ass\nBastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass\nSo many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze\nCatch 'em, mimickin' my style tryin' to talk this way\nImpossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders\nNo need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us\nFeelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress\nSmokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death\nDear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus\nParanoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees\nKeep my eyes on my foes, those close to me\nWatchin' niggas catch stray, shake, choke and bleed\nMe, a mercenary for the street, check my pedigree\nBustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me\nNow niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'\nBitch made catchin' feelins\n\n[Hook]\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\n\nYeah, Napoleon!\n\n[Verse 2: Napoleon]\nPicture me sippin' on 1-5-1\nDrunk than a motherfucker droppin' my gun\nOr high as a kite hittin' hoes for fun\nBut that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear\nAnd that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear\nIn the state I, shoot you better hide nigga, chute is near\nAnd you know just as well I do\nYou ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to\nWe might wobble, but we don't fall down\nWe take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around\nHolla \"let's hit\", we gon' taste the power\nWe started the thug trend, the game is ours\nNow we coast together, put our thoughts together\nWon't question when we die together\nCause the hour soon to come\nKadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun\nBring it\n\n[Hook]\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\n\n[Verse 3: EDI-Mean]\nWe yellin' \"M-A-D-E N-I-double G-As\nMotherfuckas, and we here to stay\nFrom curb surfin', we workin' the industry, you kiddin' me\nIt's really nothing to me and my king, you see\nWe in the big things, eat a dick man, if you're hatin'\nWe're gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off, pay attention\nScreamin' \"Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\"\nRide or die niggas, and we huntin' you down\nRepresentin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap\nBangin' out with the po-po, tryin' to get to some more\nStreet life, young strugglers racin' the clock\nAin't no tellin' when it all can end, roll a rock\nThat's the world with feelings, this a man's world youngin\nThe bitches in business, so learn a little something\nHey, stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'\nBitch made catchin' feelins\n\n[Hook]\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\n\n[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]\nEverybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work\nInstead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts\nThese drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse\nAnd the streets ain\u2019t got nothing for me but a hearse\nI can't trust the church or the mobs, I can only trust God\nAnd to tell you the truth I gotta ride\nI only roll with the real\nCause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed\n\n[Hook]\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins\nOutlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?\nMy homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down\nScreamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound\nNiggas hide like hoes when we hit your town\nCatchin' feelins", "image":
