that's down right now\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nNow this one is for my trill niggas\nOn the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas\nTo get this change another chain nigga\nOn the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas\nAnd this one is for my young niggas\nOn the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas\nJust bring your all and get these ones niggas\nNever rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Meek Mill]\nWhen I cry, I cry real tears\nFor all my niggas that died wish I could back years\nAnd bring them back here\nFor all my niggas locked and got life years\nI'm on my grind all the time this the last year\nWe gon' starve flea on dog\nThere's no limit to what I do, I'm Master P on guard\nFor that relish green like the Celtics nigga we ball hard\nOn the block running that rock like a b ball yard\nI ain't trying to be the hottest I'm trying to get my mind straight\nTweety school private, a million dollar bank account\nCruising on the island, tricking bitches\nReminiscing how we used to wild 'em\nPlay the game foulin'\nThe water ain't deep 'til you swimming with piranhas\nWith blood trailing from you and they swimming right behind you\nThe hood no good everybody think they riding\nUntil you catch them slipping put some shit up in they noggin\nThey rather see you shot up before they see you pop up\nThe chain around your neck all fresh pulling that drop up\nI came around the set nothing less where niggas cop up\nSo I had no choice but to grind and get this guap up\nEver since a boy just my moms and my poppa\nThe streets been the old head they raised me as a rider\nI don't really fuck with rap I do it cause I got to\nI do it for my fans and for my mans for the dollars\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nNow this one is for my trill niggas\nOn the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas\nTo get this change another chain nigga\nOn the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas\nAnd this one is for my young niggas\nOn the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas\nJust bring your all and get these ones niggas\nNever rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga\n\n[Verse 2: ]\nI know I bring you pain same time bring you joy\nThrough all the shit we've been through you know I'm still your boy\nYou know I'mma ride we still got each other\nTaking care of lil' brother you my one and only mother\nLook we ain't doing bad in fact we doing good\nI'mma make it with this rap we gon' make it out the hood\nPut his hands on you I wish a nigga would\nComing through strapped up black mac black hood\nWas locked down for a minute I wasn't gone long\nI left you a little [?] I know I was wrong\nYou wrote me back to back letters told me stay strong\nI had rainy days you was with me through the storm\nThat's why I show you love dry your eyes give me hugs\nNineteen years strong I ain't go without the grub\nYou and my pop had up and downs\nEven though y'all separated everyday you used to come around\nThat's why I love you mom, and I love you dad\nYour little soldier gon' go far with this pen and pad\nI know I'm sinning bad but ain't nobody perfect\nIf being broke ain't a joke ain't nobody smirking\nI know I pushed my little dime down time to time\nBut I'm stuck in the hood fuck it I got to grind\nIts gon' be real when I sign the line\nCause I'mma get you paradise my little ain't have to grind\nCause I'm going to to do it for him I know he watching me\nThey way I living hell Lil' [?] couldn't tell\nI give him what he want make him think its all well\nBut he don't see that razor and that work up on that scale\nWinter time grind with the woolrich and the Taurus\nIts [?] but you know you got to take them orders\nYou got to move them quarters that's how you get them o's\nGot to crawl before you walk that's just how the game goes\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nNow this one is for my trill niggas\nOn the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas\nTo get this change another chain nigga\nOn the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas\nAnd this one is for my young niggas\nOn the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas\nJust bring your all and get these ones niggas\nNever rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nI remember days being dead broke\nI got so motherfucking hungry man my head hurt\nI had to get myself together make my head work\nMan at the same time keep my rap career first\nBut everybody know the hood can be the worst distraction\nAnd when a nigga disrespect you gun's your first reaction\nThat's how we living in the struggle all we got is pride\nSo when a nigga take it from you shit you got to ride\nMurder homicide\nSo by all means necessary I'mma strive\nTo get my momma out the hood since my father died\nIf you don't you don't shine shit I got to try\nA made man a brave man nigga I am I\nYou keep your faith in money I keep mine in God\nAnd the only thing that's funny watch as I survive\nOn the road to the riches\nMe and my niggas counting dough\nFucking these hoes getting digits let's go\n\n[Hook: Meek Mill]\nNow this one is for my trill niggas\nOn the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas\nTo get this change another chain nigga\nOn the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas\nAnd this one is for my young niggas\nOn the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas\nJust bring your all and get these ones niggas\nNever rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga\n\n[Outro: Meek Mill]\nYou feel me, real niggas do real thing\nI hold down my set nigga I fuck with real niggas\nWe next up nigga\nGet this money nigga\nGo get this Bloodhoundz nigga\nI let you fuck them boys\nI'm Meek holla at your fucking boy\nMan this shit real man Headshot records\nCome on man",
