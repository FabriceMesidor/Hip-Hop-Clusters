I hear cuts, then I lust to touch\nMicrophones get clutched by the illustrious\nWord spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid\nBorn with three 7's in my head\nIn time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this\nTo find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists\nAstrologists, professors from your smartest colleges\nWith knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this\nSome of the things that I know will be in your next bible\nWhen I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo\nWith the great God from Egypt, manifest was write rhymes\nAlign with the stars, I come back to bless the mic\n\n[Hook]\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\nI control the crowd, you know I hold it down\nWhen it drop, you know it's jiggy\nWhen you hear the sound\nFrom town to town, until it's world-renowned\nAnd I rock New York City all year around\n\n[Outro]\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nWord up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back\nYaknahmean? (Rakim Allah!)\nTil' death do us part, it's on\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)\nOnce again back is the incredible\nThe incredible, the incredible, the incredible\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nRhyme animal, the incredible", "image": "https://images.genius.com/623e8b053d42f096f389fcd0d63e9f2c.950x950x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
