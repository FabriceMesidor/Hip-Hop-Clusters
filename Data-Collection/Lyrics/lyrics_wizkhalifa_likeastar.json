I don't care what it costs\nBlowing hella cake I'm switching states to get my numbers off\nSpin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across\nPhone full of missed calls, keep some bitches on my line\nConscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation\nKeep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple\nGood weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip\nRiding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit\nHoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch\nEverything designer on, diamonds look like Lemonheads\nOn the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads?\nGotta get my bread (bread) so I hardly sleep at night\nI do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight\nYoung but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday\nAnd having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nCruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up\nGucci on my loafers, getting chauffeured now my status up\nPaid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys\nBlowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise\nName well known, ranked at the top\nBad bitch in every city, big face on the watch\nKush on my clothes, big bank in my knot\nSmoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow\nNow I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows(?)\nTo my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints\nMad I found an avenue to get my revenue\nI'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit\nTaylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss\nIn my car blowing smoke signals out the roof\nMoney conversation talking paper then come fuck with me\nI'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/100d0985ce3b8ee4e2364dd7c94351b4.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
