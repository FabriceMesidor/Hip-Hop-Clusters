Your lazy ass don't commit to labor\nYou pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later\nThen you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered\nNow whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater\nYou wanna succeed, you have to try\nOr one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide\nYour friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised\nLook, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo\nBitch that's a fucking lie\nYou always talk about how every man's fake\nAnd you can't take it and you want something real\nShut up tramp, save it\nTwice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets\nAnd head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking\nPulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making\nTill you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station\nOne of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it\nBut you caused it, your actions made a fat statement\nYou want Romeo, then act patient\nAnd stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin'\nIt's the club, where guys put on a new persona\nAfter they get loaded with a few coronas\nThey always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of\nThen they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em\nThen when they leave you, you cry and cry\nTalking 'bout, \"Oh my god I can't find a guy\nI've spent so many years and I've tried and tried\nWhy am I even on Earth? I should die\"\nYou want Romeo, you're not worthy\nYou're cock-thirsty\nYou're nasty and probably got herpes\nSometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching\nTry a new formula, cause your last one's not working\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe term \"real nigga\"'s publicly used\nAnd I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused\nAre you one for always busting your tool\nWith nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew\nIs it because you're selling drugs to get loot\nAnd brag about how you done been shot and stabbed\nLike it's fun to be you\nBut your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through\nNah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop\nMan, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve\nCause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal\nIt's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog\nAnd all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball\nI can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public\nYou gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too\nYou'll get old and be nothing\nLiving life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging\nLook at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool\nGirls used to turn me down for guys who were like you\nTill you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through\nThen they regret it because it wasn't the right move\nYour real nigga talk seems bogus\nA real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it\nAnd his future doesn't seem hopeless\nA real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused\n\n[Verse 4]\nTo all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong\nYou inspired the issue I wrote about in this song\nYou go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums\nSee this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums\nHope the hour's long when I'm rolling out with your tongue\nThe man above is my guide, you know the power is strong\nAll you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese\nAnd the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop\nThey only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see\nThey purposely making the innocent weak\nMy existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me\nYo, we need to make a change while there's still time\nIt is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine\nI can guide you if you feel blind\nI just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/1b25d508104ab31ee5039d11dd849f48.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
