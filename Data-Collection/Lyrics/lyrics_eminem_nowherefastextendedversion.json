That day will never come\n'Til the pine box, bitch fuck you! I'm better than I ever was\n'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does\nBut I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause\nThis world's screwed, it's already fucked\nAnd I'm on top, so everyone's just\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]\nAshes blowin' in the air (so we're\u2026)\nOur world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah\n(We don't give a\u2026\u00a0no, no)\nWasted youth, always on the road\nNever lookin' back and we're never gettin' old\n'Cause the skies are black\nBut our heart's made of gold (golden)\nFuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)\nWe're goin' nowhere fast\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]\n'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no\nGoin' no, goin' no, goin' no\nGoin' nowhere (We're on the run of our lives)\nGoing nowhere fast\n\n[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]\nYou can't tell us nothin'\nHard-headed and we're stubborn\nSo, one ear and out the other\nWhen we're young, we're young\n(We're on the run of our lives)\nWho knows what the future for us could hold\nAnother shooter? Uh-oh\nNo more tomorrows, we're done\nAnd all we are is\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]\nAshes blowin' in the air (so we're\u2026)\nOur world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)\n(We don't give a\u2026\u00a0no, no)\nWasted youth, always on the road\nNever lookin' back and we're never gettin' old\n'Cause the skies are black\nBut our heart's made of gold (golden)\nFuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)\nWe're goin' nowhere fast\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]\n'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no\nGoin' no, goin' no, goin' no\nGoin' nowhere (we're on the run of our lives)\nGoin' nowhere fast", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5009337bcc3bbd60e520622f2fce0715.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
