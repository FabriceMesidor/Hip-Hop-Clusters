I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'\nSpeakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin\nI used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'\nBut that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'\nSee I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you\nWonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude\nBut most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu\nI bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you\nMy daughter isn't living yet, Atwater Village idiot\nTheir flow's dumb, but that royalty's the silliest, now\n\n[Outro: Childish Gambino]\nSomeone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round\nFly them all to Vegas man we hold it down\nLivin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures\nSippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha\nRecession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya\nRio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa\nTalk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest\nI'm tryin' to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas\nBaby mama, I'm your baby, mama\nMan, let your boy drown, they ain't save me, mama\nThey ain't save me, mama\nThey ain't save me, mama\nSilk pillow for that new weave\nSilk pillow for that new weave", "image": "https://images.genius.com/587833871590a682c8aed1b739f0cb23.906x905x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
