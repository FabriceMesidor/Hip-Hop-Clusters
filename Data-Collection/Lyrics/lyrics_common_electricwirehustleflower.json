(yeah)\n\n[Hook: Common & Sonny Sondoval]\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nBlood and magic dripping from me\nTrue thugs and addicts, I grip an entry\nEnter this game with tricks and envy\nI forget game to remain an MC\nRooms in this mind that's still empty\nOnly fufilled through prophecy\nYou stoppin me, you see I'm tryna catch this plane\nYou must be throwed nigga, catch your brain\nIt's fresh, but it is some stress in fame\nGot hoes? Ho nigga, respect the game\nI talked to cab drivers about the fast lane\nAnd Islam, masters and chakras and beyond\nThink about the hustle and somehow I see by\nWrote a letter to the concrete, P.S. we strong\nYou was at your hardest when you didn't even try\nLive like a bitch, to bitch you gon' die\n\n[Hook: Common & Sonny Sondoval]\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nMercury in retrograde\nI'm tryna get niggas in the ghetto paid\nWhile they watch pornos and Escalades\nAway from floats and the dope in sex parades\nSomebody screamin in my mind, I'm tryna find if it's me\nOr voices from the master they designed to be free\nSame revolt, can't be found on TV\nOr radio, it's livin in me\nHey lady, that smoke is bothering me\nIf I put it in your eye, ashes you would cry\nAll this rap talk is blowing my high\nI just came to chill and build with my guy\nI try to walk but I stumble off the humble path\nThis story of a pimp stick that became a staff\nYou got it, you gotta know where to aim the Mag\nArt and opinions are made to clash\n\n[Hook: Common & Sonny Sondoval]\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nOut of body experience, hard to explain\nLike the pyramids and gods, I remain\nI know pain, like Kurt Cobain\nOr A.I. playin, hurt the whole game\nDigging to the Earth's brain for worst gain\nFocused like young blood on his first chain\nI used to write shit, to please niggas\nNow I write shit, to freeze niggas\nWhether iced out or American pie sliced out\nI sit in the room with the lights out\nWhether diced out, or with their hair spiked out\nI sit alone in the room with the lights out screaming\n\n[Hook: Common & Sonny Sondoval]\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!\nElectric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f09b702f3b5aead8b4d73c0bfdb708e.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
