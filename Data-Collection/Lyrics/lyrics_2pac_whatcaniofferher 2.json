Then I\nthink 2 myself \"What can I offer her?\"\nThe tears warm my eyes and blur my\nvision. I stick 2 my stance of bravado\nand give her the same uninterested look\nshe gave me. She was so beautiful\nBut what can I offer her", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06dee150ef8c1c103f898ce76c8a66b5.401x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
