(hundred thousand)\nPretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)\nI don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)\nYou know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)\nI just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)\nMoney comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)\nI'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)\nIt ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLong pipes, big rims, baby that's my life\nWhen I pull up to the club better stash your wife\nHear a lot of haters talkin', they ain't 'bout that life\n2017, nigga I done boost the price\nTwo shows one day, I done switched the ice\nGettin' head on a PJ, it's an all night flight\nCall Forbes, tell them niggas what that list look like\n'Cause if Guwop ain't on that bitch, then that list not right\nI dropped the top so I could show her what the sky look like\nBesides the nigga drivin' there's not a star in sight\nI just might pull up, pop a wheelie on an all-chrome bike\nBought a diamond grill from my dog, told him to bark, don't bite\n\n[Chorus]\nGuwop how much you pay for that Patek Phillipe? (hundred thousand)\nPretty please get them broke niggas way from me (hundred thousand)\nI don't want no bitch to fuck with me for free (what's a thousand?)\nYou know a rich nigga can't fuck no hoe for free (what's a thousand?)\nI just made five hundred thousand in my sleep (five hundred thousand)\nMoney comin', I think it's in love with me (five hundred thousand)\nI'm in the club throwin' money on the freaks (money piling)\nIt ain't 'bout money then no need for us to speak (money piling)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/534da4803c3535014a96c123eed6953a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
