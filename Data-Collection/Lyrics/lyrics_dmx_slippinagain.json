Okay, you don't\nSome of y'all will but most of y'all won't\nI'mma keep livin' life bein' the man\nThat God made me 'cause I know only He can save me\n\n[Hook][x2]\nSlippin' and fallin'\nThis time it got a nigga callin'\nUp to the Lord where I'm crawlin'\nOn my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'\n\n[Outro]\n(Shouting)\nI wish, I wish, ah I wish you knew!\nI wish you fucking knew!\n(Singing)\n*humming* maAHmmaAHH\nYou love me\nI don't wanna fall\nI won't fall\nI don't wanna fall\nPlease help me\nI don't wanna fall\nAhh-ahh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5e36caac869327ad8b5a01792f569aac.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
