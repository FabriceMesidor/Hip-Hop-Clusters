We blowin' up your house killin' your parents\nAnd comin' back to get your foster mommas\nAnd I'm as good at keepin' a promise as Nostradamus\n'Cause I ain't makin' no more threats\nI'm doin' drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets\nI'm more or less sick in the head\nMaybe more 'cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before\nSaboteur, walk the block with a labrador\nStrapped with more corral for war than El Salvador\nFoul style galore, verbal cow manure\nComin' together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!\nMotherfucker!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a4f759aba2e16ec0dc9f29d1577cfede.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
