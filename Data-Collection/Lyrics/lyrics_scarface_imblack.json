I tell 'em fuck no!\nTell me mister officer, what's the problem?\nWhat's the matter?\nWhy you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a\nNigga's doin' a tad bit better than you?\nAnd brutality is all that you crackers can do\nAnd mark me up for resistin' yo ass\nWhen in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn!\nYou overflex your authority too\nPut your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot\nSo I can run it in reverse\nYou can treat me like god, and I can treat you like dirt!\nThe 22 years I been here I saw\nMotherfuckers disrespect god before they disrespect the law\nBut yo I gots ta diss 'em\nCuz I refuse to be mislead by this ungodly system\nMister president I beatin' on yo back do'\nI make yo mind doin' rap but I'm black doe... nigga\n\n\"We are United States of America. You honestly believe\nJust because you wear bags that means you care?\nYou have the right to abuse and treat my people like\nThey're animals on the street?

Somethin' is not right!\"\n\nRollin through my hood in my motherfuckin' dropper\nGettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper\nBut I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads\nCuz y'all was straight hoes back in school nerdy shitheads\nI finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs\nCuz niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats\nYou got a fucken pistol, now you think you're a VIP man\nBut you can get cut becuase you'd be just like the next man\nHoldin' me for nothin'\nRunnin' my fucken license plates\nMy plates come clean\nYou call the DEA\nThe DEA\nSays I'm a known drug dealer\nStraight born killer\nA motherfuckin' wig splitter\nHe don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black\nAs far as he's concerned all niggas push crack\nAnd plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check\nA drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect\nI gotta be doin' long I'm hidin' somethin' from the demons\nHe gotta be stringin' yale, let's play someone that's pregnant\nCuz niggas can't have shit but I'm a motherfuckin' troop\nYou come to us like Luke\nUndercover David Duke\nMister David Duke\nMister officer\nMister mister master\nI'm pickin' out your coffin sir\nDie motherfuckers, I'll send your folks my worst\nA breast of pig in a motherfuckin' hearse\nSo fuck you motherfuckers, punk bitches take that\nCuz I'm real with the shit that I speak cuz I...\n\n(Outro)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c9d70007eb3a5b42d898b73f3ce76f0.936x936x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
