King on guitar\nI'm the true Fist of the North Star!\n\n[Verse 2: Carlton Fisk]\nOoooooooh! What a tangled web we weave\nWhen first we practice to deceive\nGuns be clicking, running with my clan we be sticking\nWhatever, my street family stays together\nRepresent what I invent, Killa Hill resident\nRest in peace to my nigga Two Cent\nThe street life is the only life I know\nI live by the code, style \u2012 it's mad \u2012 P.L.O\nIranian thoughts and cover like an Arabian\nGrab the nigga on the spot and put a nine to his cranium\n\n[Verse 3: Method Man, Carlton Fisk]\nI can't get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lasting\nLong, unless they get protection for real\nStrong, coming with my Clan so what's happening\nCommercial rap, hate it with a passion\nThe M-E-T-H-O-D got me drinking\nO.E. all night in a M.P.V\nJust maxing, looking for hoes, you know relaxing\nBitches know the hour, it be time for some action\nP.L.O., peace to that nigga Berriano\nWhat up, Fisk? Take him to the bridge, Verrazano\n\n[Hook: Carlton Fisk]\nP.L.O. style, Buddha monks with the Owls\nP.L.O. style, Buddha monks with the Owls\nP.L.O. style, Buddha monks with the Owls\nP.L.O. style", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8eea98eab886487258b11bd4e1cca4b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
