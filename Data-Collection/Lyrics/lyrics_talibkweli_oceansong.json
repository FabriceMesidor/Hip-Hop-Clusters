The battle just begun\nBut the only way to win is if me and the ocean one\nWhen I swim against the current I\u2019m showin\u2019 \u2018em my pride\nBut her strength is a deterrent so I\u2019m goin\u2019 with the tide\nI can\u2019t fight it, no, I can\u2019t fight it, no\nI can\u2019t fight it, no, I can\u2019t fight it, no\nI can\u2019t fight it, no, I can\u2019t fight it, no\nI can\u2019t fight it, no, I try to fight it\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nShe get loud at night, way too loud to listen to me\nAnd so I\u2019m out at night, you know there\u2019s other fish in the sea\nNow I\u2019m soundin\u2019 like a stowaway, the ocean overwhelmin\u2019\nI\u2019m so small, surprised she noticed me\nLet\u2019s go away and get a room with a spectacular view\nDon\u2019t be a basic chick, focussed on the bag and the shoes\nI\u2019m playing favourites, you labourin\u2019 so hard that you broke the water\nGot all sorts of memories and cured the remedies that you could show your daughters\nGo with me so we can sow the seeds\nA gem so rare that they should keep her in the booth with the Mona Lisa\nMy poetry lives where the sky and the ocean meet\nThe potency [?] capsizin\u2019 [?]\nSee the ocean spray wetter than a kiss from my lover\u2019s lips\nKiss the mothership, if God the ocean and I\u2019m just a sip\nBecause of this waterless life, let\u2019s have a baby\nYou so wavy, Ii\u2019s crazy, now I\u2019m drownin\u2019 come and save me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Mela Machinko] x2\nNo I can\u2019t fight it\nSo tired it\u2019s like [?]\nAnd it\u2019s winning when his thirst quenchin\u2019\nDon\u2019t fight it, no\nJust let it flow\n\n[Outro: Mela Machinko]\nLike the ocean, just let it flow\nI\u2019m the ocean, just let it flow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ef6dedd7fb7fbfd332ff9ea334d4188f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
