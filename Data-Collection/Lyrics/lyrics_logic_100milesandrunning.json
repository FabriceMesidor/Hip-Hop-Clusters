I don't know what you talkin' 'bout\nWhy nowadays everybody got a palm out?\nPLP, yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout\nI have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout\nRattPack, where you at? (Everywhere worldwide!)\nI know you been waitin' for this world to collide\nB. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin\n'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean\nI am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud\nAll you bitch niggas not allowed?\nI put it on everything, I really want a cop out\nBut I did good for a dropout\nHop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy\nGotta sound swag when the flow get lazy\nWhat up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?\nAnybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on\nBetter hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to\u2014\nHop up on the\u2014hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on\nMixtape Bobby, that's the type of shit I spit on\nWoo!\n\n[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]\nAnd it's on now\nEverybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)\nGet in the zone now\nOhh, no, no,

survive, gotta survive\nGotta survive, I said you gotta survive\nGotta survive, gotta survive (Wale though)\nGotta survive, I said you gotta survive (Yeah, RattPack, Blue Moon)\n\n[Verse 2: Wale]\nUh, smooth criminal, Mike Jack\nThrow a subliminal, put your woman in black dress\nThey was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots\n'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back\nI'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic\nIf I write mine down, I incite my crowd\nI put Solbiato down (wholetime, wholetime!)\nUsed to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me\nGot many flows that any ho would vouch for\nI got many foes cause many hoes be out for\nHad the Penny Foams, remember those was copper\nHad so many homies talkin' 'bout, \"How you got those?\"\nI'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike\nIt's flight club in my house, they not like me\nMore than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me\nIt's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah\nLet me let it breathe\nSaint Laurent level, weather never worry me\nI'm well aware they be wildin\u2019 when they talkin' me\nThey bitches in the ballot but whenever I be on the scene, oh\nHammers in the Uber, I be limousine though\nDiamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow\nAnd I got a juice back around the way though\nMy chain like a penguin's Pellegrino (woo!)\nWe cold, we cold\nUsed to be in LakeForest with the Kobe fro\nEddie Bauer coat, Foams and a load of dope\nBoat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga\nI was tryna survive, tryna survive\nI was tryna survive, yeah, yeah\nI was tryna provide, I was tryna survive\nI put it down every time\nGot some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not\nPour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky\nBeen the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland\nDid it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot\nHoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil\nAnybody can hear me for real give me they props\nHookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us\nThe motto is get your paper and make you a lot\nPulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis\nThe MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks\nAnd the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'\nIt's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it\nI'll be damned\n\n[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]\nAnd it's on now\nEverybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)\nGet in the zone now\nOhh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)\nI said it's on now\nEverybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)\nOhh, get in the zone now\nOhh, no, no, no\n\n[Post-Chorus: Logic & John Lindahl]\nEverybody alive, everybody alive\nEverybody that's listening to this feeling alive\nCome on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe\nCome on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive\nEverybody alive, everybody alive\nEverybody that's listening to this feeling alive\nCome on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe\nCome on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive\nI said you gotta survive, gotta survive\nGotta survive, I said you gotta survive\nGotta survive, gotta survive\nGotta survive, I said you gotta survive\n\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nUh, woo,
