(Fa sho)\nPut your right hand in the air and solemnly swear\nThat you'll never put a bitch before a soldier (Never)\nSo by the power of the game invested in me, I announce $hort Dog officially official\nWith a clear understanding that I'd never give a bitch sweat off my balls if she was choking in the desert on a peanut butter sandwich\nI said he's official like a Shiite Muslim with a nuclear missile\n$hort Dog has earned every aspect of this game to be married to the game\nAnd I accept the honor and the respect that one gangsta to another, from one man to another\nWe are officially bonded, between the game (Biatch)\nMarried, married, married, married, married to the game", "image": "https://images.genius.com/46e22a0f3338d4832cc1464e3d1176d3.680x680x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
