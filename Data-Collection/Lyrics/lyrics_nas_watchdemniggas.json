(Uhh, what?)\nLiving reckless, die for my necklace\nCrime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish\nJetting, checking my message on the speaker\nBopping to \"Mona Lisa\", brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa\nCD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt\nNo seatbelt, drinking and thinking\nMy man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened\nSecret indictments, as on to one seeking enlightenment\nMy Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow\nTraditions started by the school, not far from the Apollo\nMy 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo\nEscobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]\nGotta watch dem niggas that's close to you\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you\nNever personal, nowadays, it's the ways\nWatch dem niggas that's close to you\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking about smoking you\nNever personal, nowadays, it's the ways\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSome niggas watch you (uhh)\nSee you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you\nYou swore to keep it real after you blow\nThree keys, new V's, went to Anguilla with your ho\nStayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough\nThem old timers advise you to them problems that's ahead\nDrama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head\nYour Rollie shining, thinking to yourself 'nobody's taking mine'\nAt the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind\nPut in a van, \"Where's the hundred grand?\", strippin' her hand\nFrom all the ice, wouldn't you know\nYou knew these niggas all your life\nWhat made them mark you victim?\nYou fucked up somewhere down the line\nNow they had to target your Wisdom\nShe took 'em to your place, straight to your safe\nYou doubted it could happen, sick of yapping\nJump in your ride, headed to your side\nPuffin' ganja, get to your crib, can't find her, just a reminder:\nShouldn't have your stash house where you crash out\nCould have passed out, your coke was gone, now you ass out\nDead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Foxy Brown]\nGotta watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah)\n'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh)\nNever personal, nowadays, it's the ways\nWatch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)\nAnd make sure they do what they supposed to do\n'Cause you know they be thinking 'bout smoking you (uh-huh)\nNever personal, nowadays, it's the ways (uhh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/525377dd6bd0f221ead9371b7b53d9a8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
