(*scratching*) It's the longest waited\n(*scratching*) The most an-an-ticipated\n(*scratching*) I got to keep it raw\nThe bitches up on it\nBetta believe that (*scratching*)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy (Friend!), I never leave home without you with me\nHere for the hoes just out to get me\nEven when it's sticky your still wit me\nYou stick wit me, you must be my (Friend!)\nA handy-tool, you never lay around the house\nA family jewel, too priceless to count him out\nThe power to keep you grinnin', a thug mentality like me\n'Cept he only beats wit women\nI need him for the health, I guess I'm a bit abusive\nI choke him up and beat him when he's thinkin' for himself\nSomethin' I really don' love doin, cuz I feel guilty and try to make it up to him\nMy (Friend!), down for him, he's down for me\nAnd even when he's runnin' his mouth, you hear sounds from me\nI speak for the two of us everyday\nWhat's mines is his, we share everyday\nAnd if you wearin' lipstick, wear the same stick\nYou look like a rainbow whenever you change it\nThe power to beg and always were a hat\nAnd a raincoat when it's damp and shower's ahead\nHe adores me, that's all it was\nThat's why he do things without me, like fall in love\nThe Game is ready to test the sharks\nBut he's too vicious, that's why he never left my heart\nIt's too late he grown now\nThe two of them probably wouldn't even get along now\nCuz of the time, ladies wanna get it on now, cuz of the rhyme\nAnd we can take 'em, one at a time, in front of the line\nI can rub it in his face, he'll never rub it in mines\nBesides, it ain't because of the fives, it's because of the nines, my\n(Friend!)\n\n[Chorus]\n(*scratching*) It's the longest waited\nThe most anticipated\n(*scratching*) I gotta keep it raw\nThe bitches up on it\nBetta believe that (*scratching*)\nMy (Friend!) (*scratching*) It's the longest waited\n(*scratching*) The most an-an-ticipated\n(*scratching*) I got to keep it raw\nThe bitches up on it\nBetta believe that (*scratching*)\n\nThe most anticipated\n(*scratching*) I gotta keep it raw\nThe bitches up on it\nBetta believe that (*scratching*)\nMy (Friend!) (*scratching*) It's the longest waited\n(*scratching*) The most an-an-ticipated\n(*scratching*) I got to keep it raw\nThe bitches up on it\nBetta believe that (*scratching*)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/650b7906e590933819584f0edd33d7a6.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
