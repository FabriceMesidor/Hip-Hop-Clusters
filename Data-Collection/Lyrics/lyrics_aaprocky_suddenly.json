Hold up, I'm feeling fine\nLocs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime\nAnother young nigga with a attitude\nI guess that's why the crackers kept me after school\nRoaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser\nEverybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us\nOn the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar\nGirbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors\nWe had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights\nAnd fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds\nAnd one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived\nLeft three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched\nThat's everyday shit, shit we used to that\nAdd it up, do the math with your stupid ass\nDon't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap\nFuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back\nI do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa\nMommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda\nCook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha\nWith the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers\nI'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me\nThe baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me\nI'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking\nYoung and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it\n\n[Bridge]\nI only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion\nThat listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons\nThey try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings\nYou my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack once again\nChilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin\nFinna ask can I pass to her friend\nThen a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again\nGold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin\nThen it's back to the back of the Benz\nLean back in the back with the Henn and a crap\nWhen I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that\nMax on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when\nA mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends\nFriends, just to put a snack up in the fridge\nWhen I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back\nNow the kids all look up to me\nThem bitches wanna fuck with me\nMy idols say what's up to me\nFrom ugly to comfortably, suddenly\n\n[Outro]\nIt all changed man, it was just like yesterday\nTimes was so ugly and now I'm comfortable\nI just only can thank God, suddenly\nEverything changed before my eyes by my surprise\nA$AP", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75621d1119a70043aadbe3fbf4387d88.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "A$AP Rocky"}
