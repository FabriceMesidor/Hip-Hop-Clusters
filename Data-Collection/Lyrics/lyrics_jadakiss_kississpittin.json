(When 'Kiss, is spittin)\n\n[Jadakiss]\nUh, uh, yo, yo\nSinnin or not, I'm grinnin a lot, spendin a knot\nDirty denim and a cinnamon fox\nBitches'll follow, gangsters'll ride, gentlemen watch\nBuy the bar, leave drunk, shoot up the block\nYou might hear 'Kiss spittin, but after the show\nYou might hear clips spittin, we after your glow\nThings'll never be the same again\nWhen your frame get bent, link get worn, change get spent\nConfiscate your whip - you think you a player?\nI could confiscate your bitch, take her and slay her\nIf a nigga nicer than me, then Christ is here\nYou got somethin in the bank? Then the dice is here\nI could show you how to gamble your money, handle a gun\nBut be a family man and go home to your son\nLight a candle where you stand, cause that's where you died\nAnd if you heard 'Kiss spittin, then you know it was won, uh\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Jadakiss]\nYo, yo\nHey yo the voice got a lot of people heated, peep it\nThe flow is like methadone - lot of people need it\nSeen it all happen before\nFeel like I'm still hustlin; cause the way I'm rappin is raw\nYou could put your jewels on it\nYou might just see me in the lightning pickup with the 22's on it\nThe stakes'll cost you; understand one thing\nI do great field work plus I'mma boss too\nLoyalty is hard to come by\nY'all know who the streets is run by, could only be one guy\nAnd that be who but 'Kiss, no security\nThe burner and some niggas that I grew up with\nAnd the brand new 911, fuck a dime\nWith a fine eleven at stop signs I'm revvin\nAnd the flow is just so obnoxious\nAs far as the Double R camp go, dawg I got this, c'mon now\n\n[Hook] w/o Jada {*repeat 2X*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/659c95067dc52688c5cb0888483ceafc.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
