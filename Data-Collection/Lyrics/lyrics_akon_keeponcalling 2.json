(let them keep on calling)\nWe gonna let them just keep on calling baby , just keep calling (so keep on calling)\nAnd for our supporters, you know you can just keep calling as long as you want (keep on calling)\n\nI used to be up on the corner all day, tryin to figure out whats gonna get me out there\nDope dealing and hugging the block, i done found out ain't gonna get me nowhere\nUsed to keep a nine milli for protection, just in case a nigga wanna take my bread\nThen the voice came down from the sky and said...Akon use your head..\n\nI had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what Got me this far,(this far)\nHad to keep a strong faith and believing, know one day I'd be a star (A star)\nBut I knew that it wouldn't come easy(Come easy)\nSeen a whole lotta hate and believe me (believe me)\nDespite all the bullshit we had to still work hard, to get to where we are\n\nSo when you hear them calling out \"Akon\", let them keep on calling\nWhen you hear the world calling out \"P-money\", let them keep on calling\nCause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling\nLet me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling\n\nSenegal West Africa to New Zealand (New Zealand)\nBlessed to have the gift to make music with meaning (With meaning)\nCause i never thought i'd come this far, with a mansion and a fancy car\nNever thought success would come this quick in the beggining ( but I seen it)\n\nAnd all along I'm sitting there thinking that its harder when you came from the hood (Came from the hood)\nWhen all I had to do was put my mind to it, and realise that it was all good (It was all good)\nCause once i got rid of what held me down, best believe I won't be turning back\nI had to keep on moving and to keep on grooving right here on this P-Money track\nAnd so\n\nWhen you hear them calling out \"Akon\" Let them keep on calling\nWhen you hear the world calling out \"P-Money\" Let them keep on calling\nCause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling\nLet me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling\n\nKeep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling\nJust keep on calling, keep on calling, just keep on calling, keep on calling\n\nWhen you hear them calling out \"Akon\" Let them keep on calling\nWhen you hear the world calling out \"P-Money\" Let them keep on calling\nCause we went through hell and back to get here, so keep on calling\nLet me hear you now, let me hear you now, let me hear you just keep on calling", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e5713c3df93191cde1af001fb204a60.455x455x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akon"}
