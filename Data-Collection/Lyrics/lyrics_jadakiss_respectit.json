Quiet money off of loud packs\nWatch out for Kentucky, cause they some wild cats\nKingpins turn to wild rats\nWhen you get that paperwork, that's wild facts\nI was raised on a hard block\nFlipped it twice, get the drop and the hard top\nWhat?\n\n[Hook: Lloyd Banks]\nI get mine by the seconds, nigga\nShining on them out here 24-7, yeah\nDon't trust nothing but your weapon\nGet your dough and don't sleep\nLike the city that I'm repping\nAll the bad bitches check him\nSolo when I step in\nTwo girls when I step out\nThem bottles in my section, yeah\nAin't no time to hear no stressing\nGet it like I got mine\nAnd they all gon' respect it\n\n[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]\nZone as my jewels hit\nDozen bottles when I'm on my cool shit\nHundred thousand on me times two, chick\nWoke up in something, I had to start with her buzzing\nThey never looked just about me, now they react like they love him\nI hate you suckers with a passion\nMan of the ugly, plug me in\nI come to win, kingpin win, I'm mashing\nScreams while I'm stepping through\nSome kind of respect is due\nChief with the spear like the Seminoles, FSU\nCountin' on my higher power, I don't trust a soul\nPut all my enemies together and crush em slow\nFirst I need a statue, then I need it dumped in gold\nFlyer than all that new shit, in something old\nFuck your statement if it ain't about a payment\nIf you see me make mistakes, I'm glad to see you've seen me naked\nTake a look at how I'm living\nLive my days like my last\nLast time I was there\nThere were tables of cash\n\n[Hook: Lloyd Banks]\nI get mine by the seconds, nigga\nShining on them out here 24-7, yeah\nDon't trust nothing but your weapon\nGet your dough and don't sleep\nLike the city that I'm repping\nAll the bad bitches check him\nSolo when I step in\nTwo girls when I step out\nThem bottles in my section, yeah\nAin't no time to hear no stressing\nGet it like I got mine\nAnd they all gon' respect it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ff9a0638eaf18af7b98d2b6e3ad8b21.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
