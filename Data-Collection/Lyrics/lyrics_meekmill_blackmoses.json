Hmmm, break every chain, hmmm\nTake me away from this place and leave me away\n\n[Hook: Priscilla Renea]\nRunnin' like I know they comin' for me\nI'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea\nFear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free\nIf they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nKill 'em all, that's the minimal, only way to fend 'em off\nLeave 'em sittin' at death's door, proper way to send 'em off\nThey'll just beat me 'til the sin is off or my skin is off\nSome tried to run, they got tracked down, now our limit's off\nI'm just tryna find the North, let the stars design the course\nHope the mud can hide my scent, pray the night can slow they horse\nGot me shackled up in chains, even made me change my name\nBut they couldn't trap my mind, this cry for freedom ain't in vain\nSee they taught us half the story, didn't know we came from glory\nYears ago we was kings before the boats came and lured me\nWoo, gotta keep runnin', gotta keep runnin'\nYah, cause they keep gunnin', and they keep comin'\n\n[Hook: Priscilla Renea]\nRunnin' like I know they comin' for me\nI'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea\nFear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free\nIf they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nSlaves, on the North side of Philly\nWhere they serve their mamas\nAnd go spend that money they made on designer\nWe shoot at our brothers but run from the coppas\nIn front of Your Honor, beggin' for freedom\nIf freedom got free in it, why it ain't free then?\nWe go get a lawyer, a liar, that's descent\nTo meet with the District Attorney agreement\nLike \"take it or leave it, leave it or take it\"\nIf we finna take it, I'm finna go straight for the win\n(Winnin', winnin', winnin')\nWe started as slaves, we came up from nothin'\nIf I could live twice, I would do it again\nAgain and again, 'gain and again, huh\nWho gon' love your momma on them drugs\nLittle babies that was never loved\nSo they run into the corner store\nQuarter water only time they get a hug\nGet some coca, only time they get some work\nSay that it be poppin' on the first\nHe was poppin' when he had the money\n'Til they popped him, now he ridin' in a hearse\nThis is real shit, nigga, not a verse\nPeople really, really outta work\nKids starving somethin gotta work\nPreacher even trappin' out the church\nPut them shackles on my arm and leg\nAll them days made my body hurt\nLocked my brothers all up in the cage\nSo we turn to prayer, hoping God will work\n\n[Hook: Priscilla Renea]\nRunnin' like I know they comin' for me\nI'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea\nFear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free\nIf they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now\nBlack Moses, Moses, woah now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ca0953926fcfc4039b6de54033aee74d.763x763x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
