I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things. And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that. See that's what happened with fat boy when he disrespected me in the game. But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma. So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle it\u2019s business 'cause it\u2019s [fair]\"\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nLate night down Sunset, liking the scene\nOn a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win\nDon't know how it begin, every day was a new\nWhen he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth\nAnd if crack had took a part of the homies family tree\nThe lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me\nAnd him to know my life story and we not even meet\nWhen we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing\nWhen the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape\nThat he would later title Makaveli the Great\nSmile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas\nTry to touch money, high on weed and liquor\nHoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix\nDead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him\nWhatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks\nI guarantee that pussy shit'll stop\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\n\n[Hook: Game]\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\nWhen the last time you seen 2Pac?\n\n[Outro: Game]\nLast time I seen him was in the mirror this morning\nRiverside, motherfucker", "image": "https://images.genius.com/72a00bceccb1bffdad5f44c0094145dd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
