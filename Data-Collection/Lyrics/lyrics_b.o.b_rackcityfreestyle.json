Mm\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm from that city\nYup that's that city\nPut Decatur on my back\nGot the whole map with me\nThis kush came from Canada\nCall that immigration\nIts way to loud\nWe gonna need proper ventilation\nTwo ladies perfect symmetry\nAnd I gave them both an A+ for participation\nBack it up for Bobby, pop it on my camo\nIf I was a flat screen, she'd be on my channel\nWhat's up with that toe girl whats up with that camel\nShe want back shots so I hit her with that ammo\nYes I am an animal I will kill a poacher\nCorpses all around me, all I see is vultures\nThat's just for the birds but I'm no ornithologist\nBut I got an eagles eye view of the obvious\nAll the arrows pointed in the right direction\nDots I just give the lines for you to connect them\nNo salary cap, no roof, no ceiling\nI could do this in my sleep, every dream worth a million\nI roll up on your poster, your CD is my coaster\nFool kill yourself take a shower with a toaster\nLife like a movie, wasted like Gucci\nAin't on that white girl but she Susie\nThat Becky, that Bridget, that Kelly at once\nRepetitive, gestures just all in a bunch\nWorld Cup bottoms, trophies on the front\nRoll up a bat I could bunt with my blunt", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3252379f345638f5b880f5055e0ca791.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
