Well ya will, give it up\nStop thinkin and begin to, live it up\nEverytime you think it's one way it's not\nEverytime you wanna start you really stop\nTrust in the inner the outer is for the sinners\nIn fact this whole rap is for beginners\nThose that have talked and walked upon the path\nKnow that they get what they want before they act\nSo why rush, if your respect is due\nWhatever you DON'T have is protectin you\nHere's what you DO have that be bringin the drama\nAsk and it shall be given, with a comma\n\n[Hook]\n\n{*singers*}\nYou trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then\nTrust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends\nYou trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then\nTrust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends\n\n[KRS-One]\nUh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look\nSo when will you be it, when will you see it\nThat thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it\nBut God be lookin out for you\nPuttin a stop to what you're about to do\nIn your life, and in your circumstances\nEverytime you speak you be takin chances\nTalkin bout things that you really don't have to have\nSo when you get 'em, your life turns sad\nYour life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?\nTrust in God, that's where the crown is at\nIt's not in what you get, it's what happens after that\nSo if you think your life is shrinkin\nIt may be cause you keep thinkin\nNot that intellect is wrong\nIt's just the beginning, it might be time to move on\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d84f73e1b21b8b4dbd679efa191364e4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
