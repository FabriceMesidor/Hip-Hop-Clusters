Rock\n\n[Verse 4: Jay Rock]\nLaughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes\nExaggerated shit that we rapped had came true\nThought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose\nI was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup\n\n[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]\nCool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth\nEven when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof\nI came, I saw, I conquered\nNo shame, I blame all of this on Compton\nThinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up\nCold game, full circle, they set up her\nI put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs\nThe fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong\nThe story was short film, the glory of him and them\nThe worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed\nThe trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation\nThe view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it\nThe angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question\nWill you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?\nWill you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/25d8a9c93ab97e9e6d5d1d9d36e64a53.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
