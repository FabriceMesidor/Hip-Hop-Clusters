Is hip hop ready for that?\n\nRick Ross: I feel your personal life is your personal life. In my personal life, you do whatever you do. That's your business. And I stay out of all the other stuff.\n\nHill: Some people are worried that hip hop is becoming less inclusive rather than more inclusive.\n\nRoss: I look at it like that's somebody telling Rozay, \"Your fashion or your music...\" You can't tell nobody which direction to take their art. That's the beauty of being creative in this thing we call art, in this culture of ours. And I'm gonna represent what I do, and my lifestyle, and I feel that everybody else should have that same right.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3dce21029cdd8aab73eb473e015807d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
