Nobody respects you for sittin down\nRespect is to be earned, it's yours for the takin\nClosed mouths don't get fed\nGotta get the wet behind your back\nAttack the storm, when it rains it pours\nStand up\nM.I.C. {*fades out*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd9172649c4be5e25b673a95fee73f73.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
