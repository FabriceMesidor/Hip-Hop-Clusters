Starter coat\n\n[Bridge]\nI grew up with three brothers\nAs soon as I was born my lungs collapsed\nAnd I had to be hooked up to a ventilator\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow a nigga shining though\nGrowing up I gave a lotta niggas shiners though\nI gave a lot of people my respect\nDaddy taught me that one growing up\nHe threw me through a shower door\nI used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo'\nCrawlin' around all on the ground like his heart is broke\nI found out he got a crack problem\nAnd he thought he dropped a couple particles\nWell I'm a fucking alcoholic so, who am I to judge?\nI'm just honorable, I be temporarily in love when I'm inside a ho\nI'm a pure artist, I don't need to see the charts\nTo know the art is under our control\nHighs, lows, problems, pain, drama that's what's optimal\nI guess I'm just the best at thanking God\nAnd feeling awesome though\nCause I survived the era of the Starter coat\nIt all started with the Starter coat\nI lost my virginity aboard the fucking Boblo boat\nI ain't graduate on time, I ain't go to college so\nA couple friends of mine did, other friends of mine dead\nI'm fuckin reminded, just because I made the most money\nThat don't mean I went the farthest though\nI hope my college friends reminded\nYou got degrees that don't mean you the smartest though\nMo' money, mo' problems\nI lost plenty mo' marbles on my marble floor\nThen I left in my Starter coat\nWhat they taught us that was all a joke\nYou may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post\nI'm arguing with Satan screaming \"I don't barter souls!\"\nPlease don't take my memories of me and my Starter coat\n\n[Outro]\nWhat kind of coat is that? Starter coat\nWhat kind of coat is that? Starter coat\nWhat kind of coat is that? Starter coat\nWhat kind of coat is that?
