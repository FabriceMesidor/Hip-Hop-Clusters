(yeah, yeah, yeah)\nBut now when they talk about Tech, will they all take caution? (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nFor the price of fame and what you gain, is it worth what it's costin'? (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAm I gonna be the real deal still 'til I'm laid in the coffin? (yeah, yeah, yeah)\nNueve\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Nav\u00e9 Monjo]\nI've been down that road and I've been thinkin' lately\nThrough it all I made it through the pain, yeah (ayy)\nI been rockin' for a minute, think I'm crazy\nBut they'll never catch me outta line\n\n[Chorus: Nav\u00e9 Monjo]\n'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)\n'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)\n\n[Outro: Nave Monjo]\nI'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away\nI'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away\nI'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away\nI'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9512e7de485fe45a8b0365fd80465887.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
