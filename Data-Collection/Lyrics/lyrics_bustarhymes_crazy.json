[4X]\n\n[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]\nI know you love the way I come and I scorch this\nAin't nothing changed niggas know I'm holding the torch, bitch\nExcessive with the heat see how I'm holding the fort, sick\nI'll twist a nigga's shit just like a fucking contortionist\nIt's bang bully bust rhymes, I'm coming to squash shit\nDemolish every hood, disintegrating the mosh pit\nSpaz, animal rap, they love when the god spit\nI know you wish you could the way I bang them regardless\nIt's the Conglomerate in case I ain't mention\nThere's bitches in this building and they all in this section\nTo dominate this shit has been my every intention\nThese niggas think they sick I come and kill the infection\nAnd when I come through you know I'm blowing the top off\nThe building and the club you niggas know how I pop off\nAnd if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off\nThe way I got police barricading the block off\n\n[Hook]\nSometimes I act like I do because of this voice in my head\n(voice in my head, voice in my head)\nIt tell me just what to do to spend a chunk of this bread\n(chunk of this bread, chunk of this bread)\nYou make them niggas want to say\n(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)\nThem niggas psycho how they ball\n(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)\nThey buying all the alcohol\n(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)\nLike they just buying out the mall\n(them niggas crazy than a motherfucker)\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nBefore I finish counting this bundle\nSo kindly as I welcome niggas (back to the jungle)\nI'm back to run this, bitch, I strive to keeping it humble\nI'm here to shake the building 'till it crackle and crumble\nSo back out bitch, see how we knocking the most hard\nI'm about to split the ocean, get to calling the Coast Guard\nBetter call the ambulance, I'm coming to choke y'all\nI'm smashing every country, bitch I'll send you a postcard\nSee now they acting like they ain't knowing\nBut I know you see exactly where the bottles is going\nA couple box loads see all the money we spending\nWe drink until we stupid and the party is ending\nNow peep the way we coming in we picking shit back up\nThe tunnel two thousand twelve the way the shit packed up\nWe full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up\nWhile I feed you the heat watch how my niggas will act up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nAyy!
