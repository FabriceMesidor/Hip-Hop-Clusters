Nigga, shut the fuck up!\nIn my heart there ain't much love\nSo if you get bashed, then that's tough luck\nFV doin' shit so big, haters\nI'm on your side now, nigga, fuck us!\nIt's Knock Madness, yeah, I'm back up in this\nI'm a real nice nigga, but I rap with vengeance\nOnly got bad intentions\nAnd I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack could fit in\nI look like an idiot to grab attention\nBut my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses\nIt's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses\nIt feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension\nStepped in this bitch to wreck\nSo don't disrespect, I promise that it'd be a big regret\nI'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch\nI chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech\nI got hoes all over that wanna give me (dome)\nThey all yellin': \"Hopsin, you turn me (on!)\"\nBut I feel like it's the Devil tryna get me (whoa!)\nAnd I don't wanna do it, nigga, send me (home!)\nNigga, I'm so cool, but I feel so low\nSee, I got a crew, but I feel solo\nI cruise, but the wheels don't roll\nYou feel what I'm sayin'? Shit, neither do I\nI'ma give you niggas one more album\nAnd after that it's peace out\nAnd I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?\n\n[Hook]\nThe world made me feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf you got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO!!!\nHopson is doomed, locked in a room\nSpaced out like a little pop in the shrooms\nGod lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision\nAnd I don't really know which Hopsin to choose\nI'm a big wreck, did you not get the news?\nI made a million bucks but did not get amused\nHow did I manage to get robbed from the truth?\nMaybe I shoulda never went and dropped outta school\nIt's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!\nBut I got a life that I ain't too sure of\nSwagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura\nCan't look at myself, I might break this mirror\n(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid\nI panic over every little scary noise\nSee, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it\nThey won't answer, 'cause they're annoyed\nI'm like uggghh, I put a porno on\n'Cause my life ain't awesome, man\nJack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again\nThen repeat the cycle\nCan't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on\nYou don't know how many fuckin' demons I know\nMaybe I should go and tell 'em read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)\nI don't even like rap\nThe only thing I wanted was just to be cool\nAnd hang out with a group of friends\nAnd solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo\nBut I got way more than I bargained for\nYou can't chill when your heart is sore\nI'm so mad I could start a war\nSo fuck Hopsin! Man, I don't even know who I are no more\n\n[Hook]\nI feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf you got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan, y'all niggas tryna kill my vibe\nLately don't nobody feel my rhymes\nDizzy blowin' up tryna steal my shine\nI'm all outta ammo, my skills just died\nBut, \"Oh my God, I love 'Ill Mind 5'!\"\nThe one where the dumb skippity bums get high\nThat there changed my whole entire life\nYou make more tings like that? I'll buy!\nWell, I got news for you\nMy screws are loose (I'll tell ya)\nThis rap thing here's what I use to do\nNow I'm movin' to (Australia)\nWhen I go ghost I'ma get a house\nOn the Gold Coast, yellin' YOLO\nOn a couch, feelin' so dope, livin' low pro\nSo these foul niggas don't know\nI'll be struttin' around like (hell yeah!)\nMan, I'm losin' my mind\nY'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme\nSee, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin\nBut I get depressed when the two intertwine\nTruthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be\nNobody cared, so I use the beat\nTo talk to, so I lose the heat\nI'm cut bad and the bruise is deep\nIs there anything you can do for me?\n\n[Hook]\nThe world made me feel like I lost myself\nMy own homies tellin' me that I need help\nIf you got a solution for me you should probably\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nLet me know, let me know, let me know, let me know\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\n\n[Outro]\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!\nHoller at cha boy if you know somebody!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/89f3b594c1d21cb0ced76a0e54600701.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
