Should I cop me some candy?\nI hear voices all in my head, bricks all in my spirit\nFuck you do with that bread, bitches all in my ear\nI done counted a dollar, then I counted a million\nThen I looked up to God like what the fuck is this feeling\nI got a rush for that life, I had a bitch out the projects\nShe used to package the white and bring me back my deposit\nI'm talking 8 grand a piece, I'm on the floor with the Lakers\nI'm talking 8 grand a seat, Louie sneaks with no laces\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross & (French Montana)]\n(I get it) straight off the boat (I need it) straight off the boat\n(I get it) straight off the boat (I need it) straight off the boat\n(I get it) straight off the boat (I need it) straight off the boat\n(I get it) straight off the boat (I need it) straight off the boat\nI get it!
