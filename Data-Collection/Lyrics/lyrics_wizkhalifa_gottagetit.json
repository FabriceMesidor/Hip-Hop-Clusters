(Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nI never thought about falling back\nIt's big change in the game, I need all that\nRoll sticks of Mary Jane like a ball bap\nBig business here, that's what you can call that\nHeard I signed to Warner Bros. yeah that's all facts\nI been hot now the shots I'ma call that\nFlow cray, some say I was born mad\nAnd I came feet first nigga this a rebirth\nMan I got rhymes like a nigga keep work\nTo get paid like the 15th and the 1st\nStuck to my grind and my thing and it worked\nNow all the little bussies wanting me getting work\nI'm either blowin ray, Sour Diesel or purp\nAnd reppin Pittsburgh til I layin in the dirt\nWhat you say could get you murked\nThat's just how it go down here\nAnd that money ain't slow out here\nNiggas bubblin'\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68cfefda5eadd906284dd844e0bf9b61.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
