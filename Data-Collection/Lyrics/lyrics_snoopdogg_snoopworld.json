the slangers at\nWere red and blue equals green, and we probably be black\nIn fact we stack G's for them keys, so when we finished doin' deeds\nYou all can't believe what we did\nProvide an opportunity in the community\nTryin' to spread a lil' unity between you and me\nSince IM the mayor, I think I gotta say-ahh a lil' something\nLets keep it jumpin' playa (playa)\nAin't too many places that you know about\nSo everybody in the world, welcome to the muthafuckin dogg house\n\n[Hook x 2]\nWelcome to my world nigga, and its V.I.P\nAnd the bitches and the bud for free\nWelcome to my world
