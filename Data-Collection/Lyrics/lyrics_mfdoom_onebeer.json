The pack comes in six!\nWhatever happened to two and three?\"\nA herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like, \"What you doing G?\nDon't make me have to get cutting like truancy\nMatter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!\"\nLooser than a pair of Adidas\nI hope you brought your spare tweeters, MC's sound like cheerleaders\nRapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin\nDOOM came do his thing again, no matter who be blingin'\nHe do it for the smelly hubbies\nSeeds know what time it is like it's time for Tellie Tubbies\nFew can do it, even fewer can sell it\nTake it from the dude who wears mask like a 'tarded helmet\nHe plots shows like robberies\nIn and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please\nRun the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt\nThe mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt\nBring heat like your boy done gone to war\nHe came in the door, and \"Everybody on the floor!\"\nA whole string of jobs like we on tour\nEvery night on the score, coming to your corner store\n\n[Skit]\nThere, it is done\nNow that the representative from South Africa has been mind programmed\nAll of the world leaders on earth are under my control\nAnd when they meet tomorrow in special session\nI, Doom, shall be voted: Master of the World\nMy plan is foolproof, but just in case\nAnd what about snow?\n\n[Skit 2]\nNow you keep your eyes open\nWhen I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)\nUh, ladies and gentlemen\nI am risking my life to tell you with great concern that I must warn you\nI, I, you must listen\nMany among you, have, have, have their minds taken over\n(What a story, start snappin\u2019)\nDOOM, gosh, I wish I\u2019d brought my autograph book\n(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right lead head\nYou\u2019re weird\nWhy is everyone staring at us?\n(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)\nRelax masseur, just do your thing\n(Get a good grip on my-)\nWhat? Why I\u2019ll bend your read out meter for ya, you little\n(Knock it off, Ben)\nWhat\u2019s the matter? (Oh, Ben)\nYou\u2019re nothing but a chicken head\n(You overgrown granite head) Hold it\n\n[Produced by Madlib]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f67af5eb94d7101171adfff4ca96a76c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
