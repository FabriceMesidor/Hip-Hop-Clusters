I'm a giant\nNew York defiant, brutal like domestic violence\nSilence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in\nProgram the jams to be fat as Ralph Kramden\nOthers come with shit as silly as Art Carney\nBut my technique tranquilizes more kids than Barney\nRemedy for stress is three bags of sess\nA day at my rest playing chess, yes\nMy thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn\nWhen you ain't looking, I take the queen with the rook then\nI get vexed, laying phat tracks on Ampex\nPuffing skunk, getting drunk off of Triple X\nBallantine, I got more love than valentines\nThe violent mind, I blast with a silent nine\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck & Method Man]\nMy hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short\nBrains get stained like tablecloths when I let off\nPowerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return\nLeaving mics with third-degree burns\nLet me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm\nDrag 'em through the mud then I bag 'em\nWe're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my pores\nAnd I be raw, for four score plus seven more\nI strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage\nLike jail, electrifying like the third rail\nBeats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus\nWu-Tang! Clan ain't nothin' to fuck wit'\n\n[Verse 3: Method Man]\nHot time, summer in the city\nMy people represent, get busy\nThe heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen\nI gets in where I fits in for head-touchin', listen\nEnemy is the industry got me flippin'\nI don't give a fuck tell that bitch and her nigga\nI'm killin', snipin', catchin' murder cases\nDesert Stormin', I be searchin' for oasis\nAs I run a mile with a racist\nPullin', swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet\nPeace to the number seven\nEverybody else get the four nine three eleven\n\n[Chorus: Method Man & Blue Raspberry]\nMr. Sandman bring me a good dream\nI don't know what's going on, if you can take us there\n\n[Verse 4: Streetlife]\nYo, watch me bang the headpiece, there's no survival\nMy flow lights up the block like a homicidal\nMurder, underground beef for the burger\nP.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of\nI switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch\nI shit, runnin' through bitches like Emmitt Smith\nCaution, niggas best to be careful crossin'\nThe street, before they end up layin' in a coffin\nDon't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however\nPeep this \u2014 my nigga Kase lives forever\n\n[Verse 5: Carlton Fisk]\nWhat evil lurks in the heart of men?\nIt be the shadow, street-life, flowing again\nI had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure\nOnly one kick would knock the hinges off the door\nThe dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck\nThirteen pounds on the table plus a tech\nJust when I said, \"Where the fuck's the cream?\"\nAnother dread came out the kitchen with the M-16\nHe tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets\nCrushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket\nMy move for the table was swift, I got my hostage\n(The nigga tried to stab you, God!) but I dodged it\nNiggas said, \"Carlton you'se a ill motherfucker\"\n'Cause I made it look like they both killed each other\nAnd I'm out\n\n[Chorus: Blue Raspberry]\nMr. Sandman bring me a good dream\nMr. Sandman bring me a good dream\n\n[Outro: Method Man & RZA]\nYou know what I'm saying?\nTical", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8eea98eab886487258b11bd4e1cca4b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
