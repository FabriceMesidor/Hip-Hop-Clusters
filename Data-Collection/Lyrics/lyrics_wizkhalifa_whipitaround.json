In the air you can't come up here\nNo bitch, only stunnas can come up here\nReal playas do what ever that they want here\nYou punks scared, rolling down the window gettin air\nReal niggas keep roaches in the ashtray\nI introduce you to the life up in the fast lane\nMoving quicker than Jamaicans at a track race\nI be babysitting don't forget to tell me pass mane\nNow break it down, roll it up\nBreak it down, roll it up\nCalliko, Wiz Khalifa, roll up\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ba15f623d81eda09cdc07f50dde02ad.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
