fittin to come through there\nSo um, leave that back door open so a nigga can come in there real slow\nYeah\n\nYou got a job, I got a life, you got a man, I got a wife\nBaby girl, baby boy, that's the way of the world\nIt ain't got back, can't get back\nYou say it won't get back, shit I hope it don't get back\nI'm creepin with you, sleepin with you\nIt's gettin bad on a nigga, now I'm beepin you too\nAnd meet me at the hot spot and work that skirt\nYou know the blue one, the new one, girl you know the truth hurt\nHeart beatin while I'm cheatin, trying to catch a nut\nBad little bitch got a nigga caught up\nI'm slidin in the rag top Chevorlet\nGot a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A\nI'm tryin to find your granny's house, is your auntie house\nWell um, you know we sorta kinda burn it out\nYou know I turn it out whenever I'm in the mix\nI'm creepin with my secret and that's how I wanna keep it, peep this\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nIf I hit this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, won't tell)\n\n[Warren G]\nI met this thang named Juanika\nShe stayed in Ingelwood and she knew Tamika\nTamika and Juanika was tight like gloves\nI seen em Tuesday night hangin at the club\nI say what's up Tamika boo, what's up with you\nShe said Mauseburg skandelous, nigga so fuck you\nSome bitches be lyin (lyin), most bitches be tryin (tryin)\nTo get a nigga caught up, that's probably why I'm (I'm)\nG'd up, boot up, to hit it and show\nI give it to you real baby, can't (shake em up dogg)\nJump in the Burg, let's swirve on the low key\nWindows tinted cause everybody know me\nYou told on Mause, you told on Snoop\nAnd now you wanna tell on me, well woopty woop\nPut me up on game, your homie\nIt was too much fun, hm, remember what you told me\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nIf I hit this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, won't tell)\n\n[Mausberg]\nNo baby I ain't with the bullshit\nI been fuckin you for two weeks and I ain't seen no cashflow increase\nYou've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you\nWhat I got in my house, the things I don't do for you\nBetter be careful cause your girls wanna come too\nGave Keisha her groove back, now I\u2019m up in you\nAnd did you tell Tamika\nI was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper\nYou's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL\nAnd if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel\nTellin them broads about my furniture and jewels\nWork on my table and how holding my clientel\nDamn do it hit the spot\nAs pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot\nBut I might for the sake of my swipe\nHit it like it's supposed to be hit if the vibe is right tonight\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nIf I hit this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Won't tell, don't tell, don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, won't tell)\n\n[Nate Dogg]\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nAin't no big deal until that ho squeals\nNow I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that ho\nTake a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go\nKeep her from her family cause her cousin know\nShe say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though\nNext time you can't come if you got a loud tongue\nI know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick\nThis time you act like a nigga who just did a crime\nYou got your ass busted now you facing time\nThe money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side\nBut nigga you was with it so when you be quiet\nNow you facin twenty all by yourself\nThe nigga you was with man he rich as hell\nEven though this story is a fairy tail\nAct like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell\n\n[Snoop Dogg]\nIf I hit this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you can't tell on me\n(Won't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell, don't tell, won't tell)\nIf I hit this pussy you goin tell on me\n(Don't tell)\nWhen I get this pussy you goin tell on
