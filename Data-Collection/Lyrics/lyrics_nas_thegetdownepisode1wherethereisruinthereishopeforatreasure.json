The most dangerous city\nLet's take a trip back, back into time\n1977, it was maximum crime\nThe President neglected us, him and 6 masterminds\n6 powerful men put New York through some drastic times\nThe rich and selfish ones, feed off the welfare ones\nAnd which borough suffered the worst? Hmm, where I'm from\nThe Bronx\nWe had to rumble with rivals on the rubble\nWhile buildings around us would crumble\nI dreamed right but it seemed like nothin' found me but trouble\nI see the light, it's right there at the end of the tunnel\nHad to find my rope, to pull me up\nCause I needed some kind of hope, to fill me up\n'Til I met one guy, took me under the wing\nI could have died if this man ain't intervene\nHe was an orphan, my savior, free spirited\nNo man braver, he was honored and gifted\nHis name was Shaolin Fantastic, the lady-killin' romantic\nCan't forget the day we met, and this story recants it\nBut yo my life began last year, sophomore of high school\nThat summer I saw her, said to myself, \"She'll be my wife soon\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0b99235142e9f90620adeb6e5ac627e.512x512x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
