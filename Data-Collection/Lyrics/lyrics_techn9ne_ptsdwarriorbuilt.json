Whatever\nDon't try to talk to me like you know what this is\nYeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this\nThanks anyway..\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nDon't let this eat me alive\nI only can see this world from the inside\nAnd I'm holding it inside\nFeel like I can cock it back and let it go\nAnd nothing's making sense\nAnd I have no patience for anything\nSo I'm going on everything\nSomebody get me out of here\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nYou don't see what I see\nSo how the hell you gonna stop these voices\nIn my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?\nTraumatized much, from homicide, what?\nDon't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one that I trust\nI ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin\nBut I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in\nWhen I stop souls in Iraq, hold, I'ma drop those sins\nIn a box so slim\nInside of my nog' grows grim\nMy hurt, it goes deep\nI serve and go weep\nA vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep\nWas a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace\nInside of my third it's so bleak\nDone so much dirt I grow leaf to chief\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nDon't let this eat me alive\nI only can see this world from the inside\nAnd I'm holding it inside\nFeel like I can cock it back and let it go\nAnd nothing's making sense\nAnd I have no patience for anything\nSo I'm going on everything\nSomebody get me out of here\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI'm thinkin' about my lady, is she doin' something shady?\nLike havin' dudes around my baby, situations got me crazy\nBrainiac in subjects, but a maniac in public\nWhere they train me at is insane we sat with no zany act\nWe in thuggish - mode, feelin' my love is - cold\nIn about a minute I'ma flip my top, gonna watch my mug ex-plode\nWhat I need right now from a lady is a kiss and a hug at -shows\nGot a grudge, it - holds\nGod bless my rugged - soul\nBut I got it, I'm stable, I'm for real I'm willin' and able\nGot you feelin' I'm ill and I'm crazed go\nGet the manic depressant pill on the table\nWhat'll keep me cool is a good birthday for my baby girl\n'Till that time I'm dealin' with my mind and trippin' up with the crime in this crazy world\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nDon't let this eat me alive\nI only can see this world from the inside\nAnd I'm holding it inside\nFeel like I can cock it back and let it go\nAnd nothing's making sense\nAnd I have no patience for anything\nSo I'm going on everything\nSomebody get me out of here\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Trilogy]\nLook in my eyes\nYou can probably see the crazy feats of danger that I've survived\nDon't wanna relive 'em\nIf you make me, then I get livid\nI might just go commit a crime\nI can feel 'em starin' at me all crazy\nLike they don't understand what I be s-sayin'\nBut you ain't seen death\nMan I been awake for seven days and I just cannot stop shakin'\nSo now I'm bout to take another shot and try to battle all my demons, can't let 'em win\nI'ma take a semi automatic into my dream and pop shots until they all drop to the end\nAnd that was goin' fine\nUntil I had a small flashback and they all started risin' from the dead\nAnd now they start to double and double, and this shit's overwhelming but I gotta find a exit quick\nMy psychiatrist told me I ain't got no hope\nI ain't got no pills that I can pop to cope\nJust need to buckle down, and try to battle it out\nAnd try to dodge the shit that they about to throw\nI know I put in the hours\nBut it still feels like I got a loose grip on my skill set\nBut fuck it\nI know I gotta get a grip on my head if I'm really bout to do this\nAll or nothin' man I gotta give it all I got\nOne shot gotta make this shit count I'm on the clock\nWatch, my shit tockin'\nSweat drippin' from the top of my head fallin' to my eyes, so God\nPlease help me do my best\nThen pop, there's a hole in my bullet-proof vest\nShot to the chest man, I'm runnin' out of breath\nBut I can't leave this world till I lay this shit to rest, ahh!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nDon't let this eat me alive\nI only can see this world from the inside\nAnd I'm holding it inside\nFeel like I can cock it back and let it go\nAnd nothing's making sense\nAnd I have no patience for anything\nSo I'm going on everything\nSomebody get me out of here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09b35bb8dd90f6a4c4e030e970363bce.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
