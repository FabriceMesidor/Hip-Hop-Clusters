Hell no\nBitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough\nI'm known for yoking jacks\nAnd beatin them with smoking gats\nLeavin token blacks with broken backs and open caps\nSo with that bullshit, step to the rear son\nThe last thing you want with Big L is a fair one\nCause in a street brawl, I strike men like lightning\nYou see what happened in my last fight friend?\nAight then\nI beat kids with lead pipes\nI leave a trail of dead mic's\nWhere I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights\nOld folks get mugged and raided\nCrimes are drug related\nAnd we live by the street rules that thugs created\nClowns get smoked about a thousand volts\nFor selling pounds of coke\nFront in this town and get a tech stuck down your throat\nI'm tellin you shit is about to get drastic soon\nI'm quick to blast a goon\nAnd break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon\nI got the looks that make your hotty stare\nI keep a shotty near\nIt's the nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear\nTracks I'm know to roast\nUntil the microphone is ghost\nProps I own the most\nI'm leaving niggas comatose\nFront and get your brain pinched\nBig L will have your whole gang lynched\nI started smoking dust and been insane since\nThis rap shit was a great gift\nThe other night some snake riffed\nAnd got a hot lead face lift\nAll through high school I had braids\nI kept mad blades\nStabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades\nI cook the mic like a beef steak\nCause my techniques great\nAnd I'm the nigga police hate in each state\nCause I'm the neighborhood lamper\nPunk brother vamper\nFuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper\nCops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound\nI'm from a whyle town\nYou know my style clown, so bow down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
