throwback (Y)\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, 'cause I am a soldier (C)\nYou shoulda been told that (E) 'cause I am a throwback\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, you feelin' the soldier\nYou niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5)\nWhoever wanna get it, then you can come and get it\nI'm spillin' these cold raps (9) you feelin' the soldier\n'Cause I'mma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it\n'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback\nBut if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone\n\n[Verse 1: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nRap's wolf is back to attack hooks\nIs back to slap snares and clap at the track's foot (yeah)\nI'm too vicious for him, too vicious for you\nAnd my kitchen is huge, we do dishes with dudes\nColdest flow of the summer, I see 'em come and they go\nSee 'em fumble the flow, it's more goers then comers\nPut the piece to ya dome, then you at piece with the chrome\nPeel your cap and eat you, and pick my teeth with ya bones\nI'm from the city of Gators, haters I dealt with them dudes\nIf you don't like me then likely I'll make a belt with ya shoes\nPut a hole in ya soul, it trickles badder than good\nFlow is sold, before any nickle bag in your hood\nI'm not a hip hop nigga, don't confuse me with them\nTruest at the beginnin', and truer when the studio end\nI'm just sellin' my game for cheddar forever\nMy intelligent brain is clever when spellin' my name\n\n[Chorus: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d & Ingrid Smalls]\n(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, 'cause I am a soldier (C)\nYou shoulda been told that (E) 'cause I am a throwback\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, you feelin' the soldier\nYou niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback (5)\nWhoever wanna get it, then you can come and get it\nI'm spillin' these cold raps (9) you feelin' the soldier\n'Cause I'mma bring it up, and give it to whoever want it\n'Cause you niggas could hold that, 'cause I am a throwback\nBut if you wanna get it, then you can come and get it\nI'm spillin' these cold raps, I am a soldier, aah, we gone\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nI'm back to call the advantage, have you [?] bananas\nEnhanced rep, rap grand theft auto mechanic\nI'm 'bout to tighten my plugs, 'bout to be fightin' in clubs\nYour blood might give me love, and likely highten my buzz\nYour type is simply a bitch, and fightin' with me's a risk\nI might empty my clip, if the hype will get me my niche\nI'm out in front of ya, guns out\n'Bout to knock ya fronts out, boxin' about to drop without Columbia\nI spit this venom myself, my independence is felt\nFinished with Slim and his help, long as he winnin' I'm good\nLong as I'm known as one of the most vicious\nMCs spittin' from the \"D\", low and behold the mitten\nThis is how I rose you bitches, Rock City chosen niggas\nWe stole this on a road to riches\nI'll show you the golden picture, globe locked\nProduct is fizz, I'm soda pop like Hova, Pac, and Big\n\n[Chorus: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d & Ingrid Smalls]\n(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)\nI'm spillin'

beyond bootleggers, they slow me down, but hey\nI'm holdin' my ground, long as the stolen sound should play\nFive nine is a winner, I speak to keep the progression\nMy views take you to school, my piece'll teach you a lesson\nNever been deep in the streets, I can't be somethin' I'm not\nTest me and get to know me, I'll put you inside of a box\nChalked and signin' off and put ya hands on me now\nLater they lay on ya chest, crossed inside a coffin\nThe .30 caliber shot, who wanna take on\nWhere they give you wounds, you goons couldn't put a stake on\nAll them ho ass niggas could do is cry with your children and pray\nIf I was a civilian for a day\nI'd take a glance at my daddy \u2012 another me\nRaise my hand on the stand like Shaggy: \"It wasn't me\" (Yeah!)\nI will melt you, smell the aroma of a coma\nI'm comin' to get you, I will help you spell!\n\n[Chorus: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d & Ingrid Smalls]\n(R) You niggas can hold that (O) 'cause I am a throwback (Y)\nI'm spillin'
