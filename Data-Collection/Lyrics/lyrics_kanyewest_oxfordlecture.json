{"songs": [{"title": "Oxford Lecture", "album": null, "year": "2015-03-02", "lyrics": "I\u2019ll take one question. I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that\u2026they said I\u2019ve got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer\n\nOK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it\u2019ll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that\u2019s when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off\n\nToday was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure this will end up online, so I don\u2019t want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that\u2019s a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at.  Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label\n\nMy goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater\n\nThat always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you\u2019re not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That\u2019s a mentality that suppresses humanity\n\nSome of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet\n\nWe have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we\u2019re led by the most greedy and the least noble\n\nWhat I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!\n\nWe\u2019re all creatives here, we\u2019re all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition\n\nWe were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas \u2013 that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way\n\nThere\u2019s a Bible saying, \u2018No weapon formed against me shall prosper\u2019. Recently I\u2019ve been doing interviews and I\u2019ve had to go back to this verse because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions\n\nI was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it\u2019s completely different to the Brit awards\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t get taken out of context, I\u2019m going to use the word \u2018like\u2019. I\u2019m not saying it is, I\u2019m using it as a comparison. So people that want to say \u2018Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah\u2019. And I\u2019m not telling you this. I\u2019m telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private\n\nWhat I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age\n\nI compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that\u2019s perception, that\u2019s tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion\n\nIt\u2019s still February, right? (security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs)\n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is\n\nWe\u2019d just look at each other and say, it\u2019s still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don\u2019t have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that\u2019s incorrect also\n\nThis humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about\u2026it can only happen through collaboration\n\nI love Steve Jobs, he\u2019s my favorite person, but there\u2019s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn\u2019t give the ideas up. That\u2019s kinda selfish. You know that Elon\u2019s like \u2018yeah, take these ideas\u2019. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won\u2019t like that, the stock holders wouldn\u2019t like that idea, but ideas are free and you can\u2019t be selfish with them\n\nI think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake (laughs, smirks, crowd laughs) you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney [laughs]\n\nI understand that I\u2019m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue\u2026he calls the home phone, by the way\n\nWith that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? [he never answered this]\n\nI work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys\n\nI\u2019d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I\u2019d say this toy isn\u2019t quality. I don\u2019t want my daughter playing with this. There\u2019s not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration\n\nVanessa is very focused, she\u2019s like my eyes, she\u2019s a piece of my brain. She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it\u2019d play with the song Wolves, and based on this concept. And when my daughter saw these wolves, I\u2019ve never seen her so happy. She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one\u2026I\u2019ve never seen her happier than this moment. That level of happiness seems to be the thing that we\u2019re fighting for every day, that we\u2019re trying to buy back, trying to work for, especially in America\n\nIn America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like \u2018oh dude, it\u2019s a $3000 shirt\u2019\n\nI\u2019m assuming I\u2019m probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so\n\nWe\u2019ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising, through car advertising, through fashion branding. It\u2019s not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that. It was somehow sold to us through a Gucci bag or something\n\nTime is the only luxury. It\u2019s the only thing you can\u2019t get back. If you lose your luggage \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I\u2019d normally say because I\u2019ve got a meeting with them soon \u2013 if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back. You can\u2019t get the time back\n\nIt feels like people do everything in life to get this BMW, this Benz, to get this townhome, to get 2.5 kids exactly. One of them has to be small, y\u2019know!\n\nAnd you\u2019re looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW after all the work you\u2019ve done and all the accolades you get, and you somehow think you\u2019re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves. And when you\u2019re sitting in traffic in your BMW, it\u2019s something that feels empty. To everyone who reaches that point. This concept of the selfish human, this idea of separation by race, or gender, or religion, or age, or my favourite thing to hate, class\n\nPeople say it takes a village to raise a child. People ask me how my daughter is doing. She\u2019s only doing good if your daughter\u2019s doing good. We\u2019re all one family\n\nWe have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs\n\nThis is a generation that is far less racist \u2013 yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur\n\nWhite people that listen to rap say \u2018nigger\u2019\u2026in the privacy of their own home\n\nThat idea [racism], has passed. We\u2019ve had The Cosby Show, Obama\u2019s president, Beyonce\u2019s great\u2026that\u2019s passed. But there\u2019s still something you\u2019re taught every day, especially in the UK, and that\u2019s division by class. Our main focus, in my opinion\u2026Imagine a world with no war, and imagine if everyone\u2019s main focus, more so than going out to a club, their main focus was to help someone else\n\nI was joking with an interviewer earlier today\u2026people talk about the number of viewers the Brits get, or the number of viewers the Grammys get. They need to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn\u2019t sell as many MasterCard commercials. Oh, I mentioned a brand! [looks disappointed]\u2026I had two things\u2026I was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech! No offence to MasterCard\u2026but that was a big fucking logo in the middle!\n\nYou guys have been taught, without you knowing, ways to separate yourselves from each other. If you\u2019re separated, you can be easily controlled. If you\u2019re too busy pointing fingers at each other, rather than holding hands, you can\u2019t get anything done\n\nYou know, Chris Rock called my album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2026well, Chris Rock and everyone else at every single media publication called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of the last 25 years. This only came through collaboration\n\nOne of the most memorable things about MBDTF was Nicki Minaj, and the fact that she kicked my ass, on my own song, on one of the best albums\u2026the best album \u2013 I\u2019m just saying what the critics said \u2013 of the last 25 years. The best album of the past 25 years that I spent a year and a half making, out there. I was exiled from my country, it was a personal exile, but exile. To come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work, and to be outshined\u2026to be beat by a girl, basically\n\nThis was necessary. I think it was one of the most important points of working on that album, was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is. Just think of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the new Yeezys to come out? Why did I have to leave one group and go to another group? Why did that group not want to speak to me? I think the Yeezys I was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse. Because these guys were like \u2018we\u2019re worrying about this shoe, we\u2019re gonna put it on this celebrity\u2019. And the head\u2019s son would come and say \u2018my favourite shoe is the Yeezy\u2019. And it\u2019s like \u2018ahhh, I can\u2019t hear about these YEEZYS anymore!\u2019. Like everyone talking about Nicki\u2019s verse, \u2018I can\u2019t hear about this verse anymore!\u2019. It was gonna work for her anyway, but let\u2019s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure. She was able to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide. And it was not locked because of my career\n\nOne of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there\u2019s hope for everyone\n\nWhen I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins\n\nI\u2019m proud of the consistency of the performances I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been out here. And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together. The best lighting guy on the planet, the best staging guy, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason\u2026To be able to deliver, back to back to back, extremely successful, inspiring, groundbreaking, visual, visceral, creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged. And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a row. I\u2019ve had to pull that card out a few times. Not particularly screaming, but remember, I will scream\n\nMy momma taught me that if I was in a grocery store and I\u2019m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand, scream at the top of your fucking lungs. If I\u2019m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we\u2019re going to use these moving lights, or we\u2019re gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we\u2019re gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way. I\u2019ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs\n\nPeople say I have a bad reputation. I think I\u2019ve got the best reputation in the building. They want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class, and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favourite ones\u2026to be called crazy\n\nI remember when I was young and saw my dad working on computers. And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy. And the guys that helped him, that he had the voice to find, didn\u2019t have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his vision, to his dream, for it to be considered to be a success. But the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime. You could say \"But you are successful?\" i\u2019m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it\u2019s something that is beating out of my chest. \u2018Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn\u2019t get to see none of this shit!\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to not wear clothes, and also possibly too cold. That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do! Clothing should be like food. There should never be a $5000 sweater. You know what should cost $5000? A car should be $5000. And you know who should work on the car? The people that work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people. And I am so fucking serious about this concept that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it. Because I was 14 and middle class. I know what it felt like to not get what I have\n\nPeople say to me \u2018you\u2019re successful, what are you crying about?\u2019. I\u2019m crying about the people. I\u2019m crying about their daughters. Our daughters, as one family. What good is it? What good is anything that everyone can\u2019t have? Every ism. They think we\u2019re done with racism. What about elitism, what about separatism, what about classism? That\u2019s all", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/e6490c4f47f4a41ea345d3609d29d4c2.800x495x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
