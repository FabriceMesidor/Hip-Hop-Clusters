Why do we die?\nAnd why do the people\nWho go against everything you ever said always get ahead?\nI've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right\nBut tonight, I am in this church\nAsking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me\nBecause I'm tired and I don't know what else to do\nSo black I'm blue, so brown I'm down\nI done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up\nI am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame\nAnd all I wanna do is believe in you\nThe darker you are, the closer you are to dirt\nAnd they make sure it hurts\nAnd I am tired of hurtin', man\nI'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared\nSo if you out there, do something about this\n'Cause I can't take it no more\nHelp me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a2c364a06d2844fd9e294ee0ea798ff.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
