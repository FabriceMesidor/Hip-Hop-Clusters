What is my destiny?\nYou tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?\nWhat have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nI, knock on the door, hope isn't home\nFate's not around, the luck's all gone\nDon't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right\nAnd I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know\nI lost everything? But I ain't the only the one\nFirst came the hurricane, then the morning sun\nExcuse me if I'm on one\nAnd don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one\nThey tryna tell me keep my eyes open\nMy whole city underwater, some people still floating\nAnd they wonder why black people still voting\nCause your president still choking\nTake away the football team, the basketball team\nAnd all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit\nNo governor, no help from the mayor\nJust a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer\nLet's pray\n\n[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]\nThese friends they come and go\nBut I got family, family\nThese kids so fast they grow\nThey learn so quickly now\nThat there's nowhere to go\nThat there's no future, future\nDon't make this here so low\nAnd we can't overcome, no\n\n[Chorus: Robin Thicke]\nYou tie my hands, what am I gonna be?\nWhat have I done so bad? What is my destiny?\nYou tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?\nWhat have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air\nJust breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare\nYes I know the process is so much stress\nBut it's the progress that feels the best\nCause I came from the projects straight to success\nAnd you're next, so try they can't steal your pride, it's inside\nThen find it and keep on grinding\nCause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know\n\n[Interlude: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nSee right now we just riding on love\nA shot in the dark\nWe ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart\nWe need love\nThat's all y'all, that's all\n\n[Chorus: Robin Thicke]\nYou tie my hands, what am I gonna be?\nWhat have I done so bad? What is my destiny?\nYou tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?\nWhat have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?\nYou tie my hands, what am I gonna be?\nWhat have I done so bad? What is my destiny?\nYou tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?\nWhat have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?\n\n[Outro: Lil Wayne]\nYeah, born right here in the USA\nBut due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee\nSo accept my emotion\nDo not take it as an offensive gesture\nIt's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me\nWe got spirit y'all, we got spirit\nWe got soul y'all, we got soul\nThey don't want us to see, but we already know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70a7ef69242915a9cd1c3f68031e4c0a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
