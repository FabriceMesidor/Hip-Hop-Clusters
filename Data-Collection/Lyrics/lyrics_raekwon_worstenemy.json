Dreads want a piece of my spot\nThis my crib, I pay here to live, fuck the pap\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nRidin' with the gun cocked, sweatin', musty tee on\nBlack Timb Bs, 10, 10 degrees [?]\nCouple Ks, some had charms\nI'm strictly Eagles, few suedes on\nNext Friday I'm [?]\nI gotta kill this nigga's head\nHe'll prolly do mine when nobody's there\nCause the only way to score, leave no witness\nA thug on my shit list, pay him to slugs back\nThe slickest and remember that I built two graves\nI wasn't stupid, I was ruthless\nCheck the bazooka crew, they bookoos\nBroke the glass slammin' my rings down\nThat's doofus, don't mess up, you got the longest clip, use it\nYo you see 'em in the lobby, they right there\nHeadshots only, kill him, he right there\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b9cf0aa51ef52878688776969ae84d35.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
