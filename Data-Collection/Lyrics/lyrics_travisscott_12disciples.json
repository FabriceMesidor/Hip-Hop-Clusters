I'm drunk as hell\nFuck work today, I wanna get some tail\nDamn my little nigga graduated, man, I wish him well Now there's no more breaking them pies\nAnd making that bail for them scales\nStep across that fence and that's your life\nWhen I run that town, that whip about town size\nFour chains, they hang on my neck, was dipped in that brown rice\nYou think something wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright\nBut ain't nothing wrong 'cause your shit don't shine bright\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm floatin' high, don't talk to me\nI'm rollin' high, don't bother me\nSo follow me, yeah, come and follow me\nIn the night streets, dim the lights, please\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was Friday, what a night, what a situation\nMy nigga Chase momma called cause he missed that graduation\nHe told her, \"Momma please, have a drink, have a little bit patience\n'Cause soon we would be riding in a car with a little ventilation\"\nPastor said that we gotta move to congregation\nI'm looking for salvation, but I'm drowning in the revelations\nXX revolution, this inauguration to the whole nation\nIf it ain't no head, no sex, then it's masturbation\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm floatin' high, don't talk to me\nI'm rollin' high, don't bother me\nSo follow me, yeah, come and follow me\nIn the night streets, dim the lights, please", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
