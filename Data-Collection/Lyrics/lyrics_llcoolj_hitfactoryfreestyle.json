awards\nFuck the fantasies, yo I got all four\nAnd 2001'll be mine, by law\nWhy name me Greatest Of All Times?\nBecause for fifteen years I kept y'all standin in line\nLovin the way I shine and my lyrics combine\nWith the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find\nFuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits\nMy hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch\nBack in the days it was the M

machine\nMake copies of your kitten with my chin in between\nThen I take you to the window so the world can see\nBaby I'm down on my knees, let your world be free\nCurl tongue come get up on this desk with me\nMultiple orgasms is your destiny\n\n[LL and LeShaun]\nYo, I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\nImagine That\nIt ain't my fault that my broads collide\nImagine That\nKnock your
