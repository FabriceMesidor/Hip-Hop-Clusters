Students converted to 'caine users\nAs soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it\nWhat's your name?\n\n[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]\nJudas\nGot my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this\nI got niggas that shoots to static. You don't understand\nHow I'm all up in you niggas' TVs like Carole Anne\nI'm a poltergeist: lyrically, I'm supposed to strike\nTry to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice\n(Swifty get your own woman!) I want his wife\nI'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice\nI rob casinos. Slugs, eat those\nYou'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalapenos\nNow you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes\nMy fo'-fo', prone to make you niggas breathe wrong\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)\n\n[Verse 3: Kon Artis]\nIt's like I'm on the john, trying to shit and get no response\nConstipated, bitch; tell these pigs to back off\nThe mind of a rapist, Denaun never changes\nBeat up strangers without a reason; I'm a anus\nWalk the street in a \"Beat It\" jacket with a glove to match it\nDrop the hat shit; I put my head on opposite and step backwards\nA walking zombie that's ornery\nPulling armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie\n\n[Verse 4: Kuniva]\nI can concoct the nine slot, plus I run with the best\nHop on a motorcycle, busting wheelies over your chest\nBystanders standing by, thinking 'oh, what a mess'\nBlast through every hickie that them bitches put on your neck\nWhat the fuck do you expect, when the slugs get dealt\nAnd make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz had felt\nA deranged team, smoking ganja greens\nThis carbine'll make your fucking head shake like tambourines\nI pledge allegiance to the streets of the D\nAnd if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat\nAnd when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your [niece]\nFrom her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)\n\n[Verse 5: Bizarre]\n(Stop taking drugs!) I'm trying\nMy little boy is dying, he losing too much iron\nAnd if I die, it won't be because I got shot:\nIt'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock\nTaking drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em\nShoot 'em up my ass; let your little brother try 'em\nTen years is what I'm facing\nPolice breakin' in my house, Lil' Bow Wow in the basement (Jermaine!)\nA rapist that'll bust in your mouth\nI'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking album comes out\nI'm eighteen years old, still shitting the bed\nBeaten 'til I'm red; fed nothing but water and bread\nIt's me again, fucking dirty jinn\nSo what if it burns, bitch, when I stick it in?\nNo medication; I'm out of Percocet\nI lost my weed plus my fucking diaper's wet\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)\nIt's Devil's Night, it's Devil's Night, it's Devil Night\nCause I came back to rule this time (it's Devil Night)\nCause I came back to take what's mine (it's Devil's Night)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/591360993ef93e1c0a2402279fb90319.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
