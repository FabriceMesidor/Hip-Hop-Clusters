(Kiss!)\nPick up my cell, spaz out and yell?\nCould\u2019ve been a business call, oh well\nTaught you wild shit \u2018cause you was a wild chick\nScared when the Feds hit the trail in South Click\nKnow me, ma, shit, I\u2019m in and out quick\nMight get knocked with paper, never with wild bricks\nEnd of the day, you\u2019ll say that you ate right\nSkull in the morn\u2019, fistful on a late night\nKeys to the Benz and you know where the Hummer at\nCombo to the safe?
