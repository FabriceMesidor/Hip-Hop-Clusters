That's where I went to school at\nAll the black kids said I was white-washed\nAnd the white kids said I was too black\nWhen I skateboarded I got booed at\nAt lunchtime I was who they threw food at\nI was tryin' so hard to cope with it\nI really wanted to run up on campus with two gats\nAnd just (ahh) let loose\nPut some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard\nWhere the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far\nMomma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude\nPicked up a mic, that's a hell of an avenue\nHe gon' take yo' ass to hell and then back with you\nLife is a class you can tell I've been absent to\nMy massive doubt has got me wrapped around\nAnd then it drags me down a bit\nI don't know how to cast it out\nI try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit\nTruth is, yo, I never laughed\nI'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at\nThe black sheep, they won't let him past\nThey would rather get together\nTie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad\nListen!\n\n[Pre-Hook: Hopsin]\nDo you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?\nLike the world is never gon' need you?\nI always do, every day is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me\n\n[Hook: Hopsin & Eric Tucker]\nAnd I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck\nAnd I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up\nMaybe I'm thinkin' too much and I'm caught in my feelings\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nOh, I'm the black sheep\n\n[Verse 2: Hopsin]\nThat nigga whose brain is off, I am that\nMy train of thought left on Amtrak\nI take the loss and I stand back\nI can't play the cards with no hand clap\nI can't recall when this damn crap\nBecame so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'\nI hate as all as I stand at\nNever got no love from my niggas\nAnd no love from no hoes, pinned up in a hole\nTryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed\nI don't ever leave the house much\nI never really thought this would be the outcome\nWish I had a window I was leapin' out from\nMy family is yellin', \"Please, Jesus, help him!\"\nWhen I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me\nWhat if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?\nSee, this cold heart isn't cozy\nAm I below par and I don't see?\nI'm so disconnected from Earth\nMy hands are out so far but they won't reach\nShould I get in a coffin?\nNot many niggas would wanna kick it with me\nUnless they would gonna benefit off it\nMotherfuckers never interested in knowin' me\nThey just be just itchin' for Hopsin\nI'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem\nI done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room\nIsn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)\n\n[Pre-Hook: Hopsin]\nDo you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?\nLike the world is never gon' need you?\nI always do, every day is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for me\n\n[Hook: Hopsin & Eric Tucker]\nAnd I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck\nAnd I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up\nMaybe I'm thinkin' too much and I'm caught in my feelings\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nIt's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with\nI'm the black sheep (the black sheep)\nThe black sheep (the black sheep)\nAre the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?\nOh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/538c208e6d573914c37ce0417736d005.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
