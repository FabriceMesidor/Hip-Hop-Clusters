Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)\nWho really has the time at all?\n(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is It?)\nIt ain't perfect but I don't mind\n'Cause on the surface I look so fine\nBut really I'm buggin', buggin'\nMakin' somethin' out of nothin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, it feel like the weekend on a Tuesday, I can move dates\n\"I got something else to do\" day, always do hate\nIf I do say, the D'USS\u00c9 with the homies like it's Kool-Aid\nMe? I'm just tryna play it cool, J (anyways)\nYeah, mind over matter, I'm purer than alkaline\nBeen stuck on album time, I gotta get out to shine\nFly on the wall, shit, I was buggin'\nMiss me like you gettin' withdrawal, I keep that coming, yeah\n\n[Bridge 2]\nI'm treading water I know\nIf I stop movin', I'll float\nThey nothing new it-\nJust play it cool baby, just play it cool\nYou know, cool\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, it ain't perfect but I don't mind\nBecause it's worth it\nWho really has the time at all?\nIt ain't perfect but I don't mind\n'Cause on the surface I look so fine\nBut really I'm buggin', buggin'\nMakin' somethin' out of nothin'\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, tell me you love me, spin me around\nPretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down\nSeen it all unfold, sat back and watched\nKnowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop\nBare feet, runnin' late, her car started\nEven though the only thing that she drivin' a hard bargain\nMore important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but\nShe put me back together when I'm out of order\nPerfect", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f45938f2d5ece669fce342e5493f634.375x375x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
