Am I the supplier?\nAm I rich? Do I have any buyers?\nOnce they realized that they couldn't move an inch us\nThat's when they divide and try to Willie Lynch us\nSaid that my guy said it was my shit\nOh I'mma fall for that (?) shit?\nC'mon man I'm from a Chi environment\nExercise my right to stay silent\nSmoking Bob Marley but I ain't gonna wail out\nOr sing to the cops man, no sell out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/334bd07941665eb5b381fb51bced319d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
