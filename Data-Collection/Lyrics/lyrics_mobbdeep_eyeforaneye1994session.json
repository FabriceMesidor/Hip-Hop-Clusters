this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nFirst of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil\nThe cream will have you shitting on your people\nLiving like lotto, everything is everything\nAin't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring\nI'm Making figures that I never thought was possible\nYou try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital\nMy crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras\nKid you'll get your cap peeled backwards\nFor years, I've been trying to blow for years\nGetting bent off Mo\u00ebt, spending a G on beers\nLiving life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet\nTil the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot\nMy invincible crew will never stop\nIf you looking, you can find me rising to the top\nI'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked\nFloating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic\nIm trying to make a half a million triple in size\nBefore my eyes, another part of my team died\nI can still hear his voice while he up in the sky\nWhile the rest still living steady telling me lies\nIt's like a bad dream and I can't wake up\nBut at the same time I love it and I can't give it up\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nI got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any\nThe clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty\nPresenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you\nChoking off your own blood watch you face turn blue\nAin't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do\nMake you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late\nOn your way home, you left a trail leaking\nI bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking\nNow you're laid up in ICU for the weekend\nAt the same time I'm outside getting my thug on\nThe same eyes got my mind fucking bugging\n\n[Chorus]\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nA drug dealer's dream:\nStash CREAM, keys on a triple beam\nFive hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam\nCondominium, thug dressed like a gentleman\nTailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend\nMurdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring\nShank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in\nNew York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse\nShoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us\nMad man my sanity is going like a hourglass\nGun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams\nI got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you\nIs down with my ill crew of psychos\nNas Escobar moving all your weak production\nPumping corruption in the third world we just busting\n\n[Verse 4: Raekwon]\nMy teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot\nMy ring's rock icy like a fuck with a green drop\nCall me santa with more snow than montana\nCamouflage Wu emblem on my bandana\nPlay fair sight, never in a million these cats bite\nFolding under pressure like beach chairs\nDrug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way\nBurning biggys on bikes its only right\nTwo for fives 95, five 25s didn't I\nRewind glaciers mixtape niggas throwing eyes\nCheck dates, my whole crew making they Tec's spray\nShooting ninas off sideways we know it\n\n[Chorus]\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\n\n[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]\nBeat downs galore, kids walk away holding they jaws\nWishin they had yours, tours posters plus sneaker stores\nBalls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline\nRestroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine\nShellbox nines never been popped, Knowledge Bill shots\nIsraelis be hittin me, Bing's death made the store hot\nJewels gleam, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king\nGoldie brought a pair, Chinese man dot him with the green\nWorld's greatest, Las Vegas payed us, rap crusaders\nCasino champs, Gods sport the latest\nToday's math, fuck nuthin but ass, take Cristal baths\nGo half on his robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash\nKid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful\nYou get lynched, starks will play it cool like a mint\nLike a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date\nAlkies get the shanks, yo it's swine inside Hostess cakes\nYo my man, check the moral or get deaded\nYou bust a shot and that big bullet was unleaded\nWord up\n\n[Chorus]\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
