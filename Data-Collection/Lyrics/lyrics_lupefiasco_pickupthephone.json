Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]\nHello, can you hear me?\nHello, are you there?\nHello, would you pick up the phone?\nHello, can you hear me?\nHello, are you there? (yeah, are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)\nHello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nWe were like, if a tree falls in the forest and\nNo one is around, does it really make a sound?\nThat's romantic and profound, but now\nWe're like lumberjacks holdin' the axes that brung it down\nSo I'm now on your message, talkin' 'bout \"Remember?\"\nSilence in return, that sound like 'Timber!\"\nThere's some that can't see the forest because they're liars\nBut I can't see the forest 'cause of the fire\nAnd in our prehistorics, the flowers was rootin' for us\nBrontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus\nAnd then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist\nThat's why I lost my FTD endorsements\nBut that's really not important\nMy sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant\nDespair wears a wire, my longin' rappin' a song\nMy worry is a rat, my lonely tappin' the phone\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]\nFeeling kinda restless\nDid you get my message?\nIt's swirling around and so (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)\nI wanna give you reasons (yeah)\nTell you what I'm feeling\nBut none of these lines are secure (nah)\nNo, don't tell me that you care (uh huh)\nWhen I know you're standing there (yeah)\nI left the story of my life on your answering machine (what else? Uh huh)\nMy tears run off your shoes (yeah)\nLike waters from a goose (uh)\nYou try to wash off all the dirt\nBut your hands aren't getting clean\n\n[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]\nHello, can you hear me?\nHello, are you there?\nHello, would you pick up the phone?\nHello, can you hear me?\nHello, are you there? (are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)\nHello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?\n\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nThe make-believers on receivers as you sit back and observe\nAs the rubber curly cord just absorbs all my words\nWill you collect us then connect us or neglect us on the whole?\nInto the wall, then cross the wires on the telephone poles\nThen bounces off the towers, then up into the satellites\nThen falls down back to Earth to bring a broken heart back to life\nHappens all the time, lost an appetite and lack of sleep\nIf it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep\n\n[Chorus: Sebastian Lundberg & Lupe Fiasco]\nHello, can you hear me?\nHello, are you there? (Hello, are you there? Yeah)\nHello, would you pick up the phone? (Come on)\nHello, can you hear me? (Come on)\nHello, are you there? (Come on)\nHello, would you pick up the phone?\nWould you pick up the phone?\nWould you pick up the phone?\nHello, would you pick up the fuckin' phone?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec1537f1f3e626122d4fe4985675cd80.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
