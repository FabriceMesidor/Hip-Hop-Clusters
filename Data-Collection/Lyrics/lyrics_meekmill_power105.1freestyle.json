got out the pool\nSkinny nigga sittin' on that money like the jews\nOnly time we make it to the TV if it's the news\nWe was tryna make it out them trenches, you dig?\nYoung niggas trappin' out them benches, you dig?\nYou gon' be a felon or a witness, you dig?\nAll this money, murderin' is senseless, it is\nFuck 'em and tell 'em if I ain't gon' feed 'em\nAll this money I'm gettin', prolly ain't gon' need 'em\nNiggas said that we beefin', prolly ain't gon' see 'em\nI'm just pushin' them buttons on 'em and they gon' leave him\nThat's that drumma sound, drumma sound\nBodies droppin' in the summer now, don't come around\nI'm in Philly where niggas totin' them millies\nThey pop 'em just like they wheelies\nYou suckers'll never feel me, I understand it\nPitch the rock we never underhand it\nClear-port we got another landin'\nTouchdown in Miami another Patek that's another Grammy\nI never put the money over family\nPussies they forever fear me\nThat money made me a monster\nNo more noodles we eatin' pasta\nDick roll rappers they eat lobster\nWe been eatin' steak nigga we mobsters\n\n[Verse 2: Mel Love]\nWe Dreamchasers, laser that beam-chaser\nWe need paper, scrapers, I'm speed racer\nTold that bitch [?]\n[?]\n80 niggas so fake, they out of order\nHold the work it could swim and take all the water\nI done motherfuckin' the [?] shark in the water\nWe done came from all the muscle\nMy nigga came from a quarter\nTo a motherfuckin' stone, puttin' in a order\nOr puttin' niggas on order\nPussy [?]\nServe the work up out the drop I'm puttin' in on the order\nTryna get this rap money, and stack it like trap money\nBut others like crack money\nLet's get that work from the border\nTryna line up and get it, [?]\nI'ma line up all my nigga and fuck it I won for them\nWhat I want for myself and fuck it don't need no help\nAll that we ever had, we all that we ever got\nCame from onions and soda\nBaking soda and pots\nArm and Hammer that's yolla, tryna bang on the block\nWorkin' shifts on the boat, runnin' around the clock\nBut fuck it I've been so hot\nSend all these niggas Chasers the squad\nI be different the fuck off my dick\nI'm in my nine niggas trippin'\nGon' slide on who, niggas weak\nAnd I don't fear no man so let's beef nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nIts a war goin' outside nobody safe from\nLayin' where its no opportunity had to make some\nSaid it wasn't room in them rooms had to take some\nWhen I got my foot in the door brought my day ones\nA1s and they got tecs like Draymond\nChef like Raekwon, in the kitchen with napalm flame shit\nBad bitch with me gettin' her slay on\nLet me in this bitch I'ma stay on\nAny nigga in the way we'll pull that k on\nFill his clothes up with holes tell him get his J on, Yeezus\nI'm too rich to be this reckless\nSpent two bricks just on my necklace, I'm just coutin' my blessings\nYoung nigga started with nothin' cause I was destined\nFuck nigga runnin' the game I can't accept it\nThink about it, now that Trump won the election\nThey gon' try and box us out like the Mexicans, \u00e1ndale\nRunnin' the ye, see the cops go the other way\nI just bought my dawg a brick like the other day\nHe couldn't get his momma nothin' on Mother's Day\nSo I put him on help him get his money straight, that's gang\nLet me get it\nNiggas say they be with me, but I don't be with niggas\nDiamonds shinin' like a swiper all my pieces hitin' lit\nThem niggas broke they can't be beefin' with us\nPut some respect up on my name all tree them niggas\nI got a fetish for Lamborghinis and fettuccine\nBad bitches that never see me want to double team me\nTriple double get what I want like I own a genie\nAladdin, my bitch look like Jasmine\nFuckin' with that nigga and you know he told\nI'm the realest nigga on the totem pole\nChasin' down the money 'til I overload\nTwo bad bitches on the menu I take both of those\nI don't care if they was real sisters\nNiggas broke talkin' like they real niggas\nOnly thing that's real about 'em is that they real bitter\nAnd real salty fuck 'em\n\n[Break]\nThat's what we on too\nMake sure you go get that YG Still Brazy\nWe came through the trenches\nAsk YG when he was 23 he was givin' me Glocks like it was water\n\n[Verse 4: Meek Mill]\nLet me [?] an acapella before we get out of here\nWe gon' get to that shit when we get back\nTen years of probation, that's 3650 days shit\nHow I'm supposed to make it\nI'm tryna work and they givin' me violations\nShackles on my ankles still runnin', dreamin', and chasin'\nRunnin' out of patience, sick and tired of waitin'\nMy niggas turned they back to the streets and I really hate it\nFathers wasn't lovin' they sons filled 'em with hatred\nPut them white cops in hood knowin' they racist\nSettin' us up for failure, made us rebellious\nJudge slammin' that hammer and nailed us\nWe was sheltered by Section 8\n'Member nights when niggas barely ate\nOodles and noodles that was every day\nAskin' for a second chance like askin' momma for a second plate\nThey hit my niggas twice they other day\nWe ain't grow up like the Jenners the only choice we had was fuck with Ye\nSometimes it make me want to run away\nSometimes I see my people struggle and I want to stay\nGot me thinkin' will I ever put this gun away\nNo, I'm just tryna stay alive and survive through the rain and the fire\nAll this pain in my eyes\nWrote this verse with my blood see the stains on my palm\nWe got stains on our record so we can't get a job\nLearned the game from my mom\nShe told me everybody ain't gon' make it and that's why\nI stay to my motherfuckin' self and get this money nigga\nDreamchasers you already know we in the motherfuckin' buildin' nigga\nClue what's up, New York City what the fuck is up\nWe in this bitch\nWe visualize and dream and growin' up and being kings\nKillin' for currency out to get it any means so it seems\nAnd the good die young, at early teens in between\nIn the hood I'm from, we don't believe we could believe\nBabies survivin' off coca leaf that dope and weed\nThey lock us up and they throw the keys where\nNobody can find 'em and location anonymous\nMan judgin' man, man beggin' that your honor give a chance\nSons followin' the steps of fathers and\nFathers go to jail sons followin' behind 'em and\nSentence with no commas its just periods behind 'em and\nIf you got a felony just kiss goodbye to colleges cause ain't nobody hirin'\nFill an app try again\n[?] back to sellin' weed and movin' crack 'til your retirement\n\n[Outro: Meek Mill]\nYo what up its your boy Meek Milli\nGet ready for Clud Radio you know what time it is in this bitch\nNigga let's it, double M G, DC, Dreamchasers we in the buildin' nigga\nWe ain't even got no more rap, we killin' shit we ain't doin' no talkin' on the interviews we out nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6929169de7116d41676151bdea5cc773.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
