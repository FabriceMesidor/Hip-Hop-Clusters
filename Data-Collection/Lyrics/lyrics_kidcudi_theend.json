You don\u2019t know me money\nDay & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip\nSipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me\nThat's my fucking best friend\nWhen I'm tweaking she be calming a brother\nLike the touch from a mother\nI am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it\nThe feeling is something like a spiritual healer\nThat could end me, I think that\u2019s the part I find intriguing\nA little bit off, I am, I am, I am\nI see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am\nIt\u2019s something like a spiritual healer that could end me\nI think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending\n\n[Outro: Nicole Wray]\nI\u2019ll never do it again, do it again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/14137476a886859359839ede660df307.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
