Oh man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn\n\n[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]\nIn '09, we were still on the bus, nigga\nBefore Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush\nWhen it still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me\n'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'\nI ain't know we was on the cusp of the money\nTryna get a few bucks under custody\nAnd my twin brothers was all Syd's brothers\nSo my kin gully and my skin toughened\nThick lens coverin' my eyes now\nThey ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now\nAnd if this a different way to clear my mind out\nI need to find out, I'm doin' fine now\nAnd I don't look as stupid when I talk now\nAnd everybody at the show look astounded\nPosted up drowsy\nIn the cut so much that it's pus 'round me\nCatch him in the daytime or dusk hours\nSmokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it\nIf your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)\nCan't call it harsh livin' when the margin\nBetween you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets\nAnd you workin', givin' arm and a leg\nSay he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'\nLike a long distance bitch\nWho you know that's out that's harder than this?\nChargin' niggas like a Tomlison win, nigga\nSlight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown\nRunnin' wild on the route that was picked\nWhen the clouds branch out\nAnd I'm out with my face in the shallow, I been drownin' again\n\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nI could drown you with a shallow soul\nShallow soul, shallow soul\nYou are drinkin' from a shallow soul\nShallow soul, shallow soul\n\n[Verse 2: Da$H]\nDrugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian\nJust look at the state he's in, yo, yo\nThe most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist\nThat ain't suckin' corporate dick\nSaid it with my balls in grip\nOther hand got a cork to hit\nAll this Ralph be the sportsmanship\nWalked in and said I needed all the chips\nAs well as the one on my shoulder\nFeel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor\nCops still lockin' niggas up for quotas\nBrain still numb from the shit in the soda, so\nA generation lost\nFacin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft\nWarrants bein' filed for the cases fought\nAnd them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost\nYou ain't Superman when that cape is off\nJust Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise\nTryna see the bright side of life\nAnd a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture\nIt's like hard liquor, and see people are books\nSo you judge a ma'fucka by the first page\nAnd a bitch by the back cover\nThe crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered\nReal ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage\nThey said my shit was so insane\nIt was like Cobain did his last number\nMotherfucker\n\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nI could drown you with a shallow soul\nShallow soul, shallow soul\nYou are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)\nShallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Mac Miller]\nYeah, well\nIsn't he dizzy off the up's and down's\nHe got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)\nShit was s'posed to get me high\nWhy the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn)\nAnd I'm strung out on this dusty couch\nIn a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, \"Slow down\nStop runnin' your mouth\nYou holdin' my money, just shut up and count\" (Woo)\nMy right nostril hasn't worked in a week\nPlus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik\nMe, I'm swervin' in the Jeep\nBurnin' weed, doin' circles in the street\nYellin', \"Play my shit or wake the baby up!\u201d\nI get her faded, put it back in her labia\nAll my life I've been afraid of powder\nAll my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?\nThe wrong decision always called my phone (Okay)\nLast supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)\nI need somethin' stronger than a cortisone\nThat can save me from the war unknown\nShout out to Soulo (Soul!), and rest in peace Alori Joh\nThe devil on the other side of the glory hole (Whoa)\nAny time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat\n'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road\nLook at all these new faces\nI see, I see, I see\nThey comin' on the plane but they're leavin' their suitcases\nBeen a criminal before scales were digital\nUsed the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Whoa)\nHate myself up to strangers (Woo)\nBut the raps are just way too flagrant, so\nHere I go (Here I go)\nThrowin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary (Whoa)\nI've never been religious\nBut I feel like the scripture's got it all there, it's not just gypsies and fairies\nThis could be my last breath\n(Last breath) I'ma take my time (Send it please)\n'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:\nRight by the pussy with nothin' on my mind\n\n[Outro: Mac Miller]\nYou are standing in a shallow soul\nYou are speaking with a shallow soul\nShallow soul\nI could drown you with a shallow soul\nTell me why I'm so lonely\nShallow soul, shallow soul\nYou are drinking from a shallow soul\nTell myself I'm free\nShallow soul, shallow soul\nYou are standing in a shallow soul\nUh, I've been without sleep for 80 hours so I'm beyond simple fatigue", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13ce35ef8b892b61cbe71e14f5a9e8f2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
