and sticks, 7-tr\u00e9s, no tops, ya dig, candy paints\nYo\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross & Kodak Black]\nGold rims, good dope, make a wonderful summer\nHeard I was a genius, when coming to the numbers\nDo it for the young fathers, still signing the lease\nAnd all the hustlers who got somethin' in common with me\nIf I got the keys, then it's a car I'ma keep\nWhen I line her up they say I remind 'em of Meech\nShootouts in Miami, can't spend no time on the beach\nDo or die, get a plug, I got a hundred ki\nBrought her to Florida, she fell in love with lobster\nThen I bent the corner with a couple drops\nGet your money, let's reward ourselves\nLife a test and every day we got so much to fail (Right)\nTold you the world was yours, now you in a cell (Glee)\nCenter of attention, now you by yourself\nAlways did the shopping, now you're on the shelf\nNext time you see your daughter, bet her heart'll melt (Shh)\nPray for your niggas, if can't do nothin' else (They need it)\nPray you see the bigger picture, look at momma health (Yeah)\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nLet down the top, nigga that's your paystub (Glee)\nIt's hard as hell for this Florida boy (A Nolia boy)\nHome of young niggas killin' with no remorse, with no remorse (No remorse, bitch)\nHome of young niggas killin' with no remorse\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nYeah, bitch, I'm a Florida Boy\n73s to them AMGs, now we rollin', boys (Rollin' boys yeah)\nYeah my momma raised me, FLA paid me\nI beat all of them cases, I'm on\nYeah, bitch, I'm a Florida boy (Ooh)\nOld school, big-ass rims, sittin' like Tonka Toys (Tonka Toys, yeah)\nI got a Florida state of mind now, I be on my grind now\nLet my niggas shine now, they on\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nI could've been a student, my mind was polluted\nProject unit nigga, I could smell all the raw sewage\nTold myself, \"Time to go do this\"\nSidelines, can't be switching up like I'm Ray Lewis\nFor the young niggas watching, I'm rocking my jewelry\nTurn it into franchises as you maturing\nJonny Dang seen a lot of chains\nSubstituted for them days I miss my father's face\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nAll these politicians need they face cut\nBeefing with niggas you went to school with\nEaster Sunday at church, prayed in the pulpit\nI'm rocking Rollies with homies I made some moves with\nI'm buying homes for the woadies we toted tools with\nQuit acting funny, get money, and fuck some new chicks\nOr get buried with niggas you broke the rules with\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nYeah, bitch, I'm a Florida Boy\n73s to them AMGs, now we rollin', boys (Rollin' boys yeah)\nYeah my momma raised me, FLA paid me\nI beat all of them cases, I'm on\nYeah, bitch, I'm a Florida boy (Ooh)\nOld school, big-ass rims, sittin' like Tonka Toys (Tonka Toys, yeah)\nI got a Florida state of mind now, I be on my grind now\nLet my niggas shine now, they on\n\n[Bridge: T-Pain & Kodak Black]\nI ain't gotta hate no nigga, I just keep on winnin'\n(Call me a Florida boy, ooh)\nMy bitch'll pull up in the Chevy, you can't keep up with her\n(Call me a Florida boy, yeah)\nYou ain't gon' hit me for no lick, bitch I keep it on me\n(Call me a Florida boy, ooh)\nTop down by myself, but I'm never lonely\n(I'm lonely boy, Call me a Florida boy)\n\n[Verse 3: Kodak Black]\nSee, I ain't really finna have remorse for ya\nThis ain't a Maybach but my Audi A8 seats go way back\nThey go way back\n30s on the Cutlass, I'm a golden acre warrior\nLivin' like the OG slime peanut butter\nNigga gotta eat, I'm talkin' to the Last Supper\nI'm Jordan in this motherfucker, puttin' mad numbers up\nProject Baby street life what I'm a customer of\nYeah, that's what I'm accustomed to\nBoy, I'm a young bull come charging when he running you\nWe ain't over there in public houses like we growin' too\nBut it's still a struggle so you can't get too comfortable\n'Cause niggas see that money coming and they try to come for you\nBut they don't know that this famous shit mean nothin' to you\nStill keep a gun or two and I still dump at you\nCrawl 'fore I walk, started running then I fucking flew\nLivin' like The Huxtables, but still eatin' Lunchables\nYeah, and we ain't even need a chorus\nWe do this shit for Florida, I was rich before touring\nThor, standing on my ten, got it out the floor\nBeen jumped off the porch, since 14, I had lawyers\nHit a lick in a stolen car with no headlights\nI'll stop at the Wing Stop, but not the red light\nI killed the whole DMV, no star shit\nGot it off credit cards, shit, yeah, larceny\nIt was back in 2015, me and Baby linked\nBut I'm just a type of young nigga, listen 'fore I speak\nI'd be flawed to say Wayne ain't influence me\nI don't play both sides, nigga, I keep it too G\nI apply this music shit like the rules to the skreet\nWhacking niggas and jacking niggas since I was snatching jewelry\nI'm a Haitian boy, I'm draped up in Cuban link\nHaitian but I'm draped up in Cuban link\nI swear we ain't even need the hook\nThey gave my dawg a long sentence, he can't even read a book\n\n[Outro: Kodak Black]\nMaybach Music\nSniper Gang Music 2, yeah Sniper Gang Music 2, yah feel me\nThe whole Tri county, I love the Tri county but I hate everybody\nThat part", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b4934e55bdb461512923a89d772c44f5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
