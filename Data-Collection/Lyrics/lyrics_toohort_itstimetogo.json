I'm the #1 Player\nYou can call, or I'll see you somewhere\nAs long as we make this happen again\nYo' fine ass sittin' back in the Benz\nCause yours is the best, I must confess\nBut right now, it's time to get dressed\n\n[Hook]\n(It's time to go)\nGet up out my face\nYou better get up out my face\nGet up out my face\nYou need to get up out my face\n(It's time to go)\nGet up out my face\nYou better get up out my face\nGet up out my face\nGet the fuck up out my face\n(It's time to go)\n\nYou need to get on up out my face... {You gotta go}\n(It's time to go)\nYou need to get on up out my face... {It's time to go}\n(It's time to go)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a946f356e20bac26df64ff8cca250ed8.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
