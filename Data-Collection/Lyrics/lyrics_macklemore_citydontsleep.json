Then put your ones in the air\nNow point it to the ground, 'cause change starts right there\nNow if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air\nYou think the system that we're living in is not fair?\nYou wanna see change? Then put your ones in the air\nNow point 'em to yourself, 'cause change starts right there\n'Cause change starts right there\n\n[Outro: Don-P]\nThe streets are cold, all alone\nIn the city\nWhere you lay your head is your home\nWhat a pity\nPeople pass you by with a glance\nSay you're filthy\nBut they don't know they pain you've been through\nNo, not really", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
