Now we in the mix\nBaby moved up in my crib and she left my ex, damn we speedin\n\n('Now girl, you mean the world to me' repeats)\n\nI\u2019m a king, you the queen\nHis and her 6\u2019s and diamond rings\nYou don\u2019t have to look back at him\nJust get your bags packed and then..\nA new life soon begins\nLike I told you when I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby girl had a son\nHe was 3, yea I took him in\nNow she call him little me, I even look like him\nNaw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker\nShe be calling him Blackie..that\u2019s cause his real father jet black\nSo she treat him like it\u2019s a setback..\nI don\u2019t respect that\nNow his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number\nNow how he get that?\nSee, now I knew we was a mismatch\nI\u2019m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked\nI see where I went wrong at\nI just tried to bring out the queen in you..\nBut when you make a girl leave a man..\nYou never really know where she stand..\nHow you know she really yours?\nSomebody could do the same to you..!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23061dd2dc7e863127db561906debd27.434x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
