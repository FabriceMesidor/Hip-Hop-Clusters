Don't even know how to grow fruit Detached from your roots, nigga, me too\nI'm doing drugs, fornicating and eating fast food\nBut I know I got three eyes cause I'm looking past you\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Ab-Soul]\nEnter the void\nThis for my hundred dollar billers to destroy\nSpreading word of knowledge to through decoys\nPeople realize that it's time to deploy\nStay on point: open your third eye, boy\n(And keep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your all seeing eye open)\n\n[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]\nHad to escape nest, told Moms I'm Apex\nAnd plus I lay checks, I bust in the latex\nSo it's nothing stopping the kid if you get where I come from\nBusting conundrums on nuns and condoms\nDon't want no problems, It's the number one solver\nCan't see me with these sentences, get your bars up\nI'm close to the pen, I depend on this shit\nAin't tryna be dead bent, I'll ascend off this spliff\nYou can't pretend with this shit\nSee, I know what's real and what isn't\nAin't shit obscured with my vision, plus the herbs that I'm hittin'\nAllow me to observe what is hidden\nCould have been a cherry-pickin' nigga\nIf I ain't make jams and bury niggas\nUsed to be the sweetest 'til life handed me the lemons, nigga\nNow everyday I see the sour patches\nThe flower of life devoured into ashes\n\n[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Ab-Soul]\nEnter the void\nThis for my hundred dollar billers to destroy\nSpreading word of knowledge to through decoys\nPeople realize that it's time to deploy\nStay on point: open your third eye, boy\n(And keep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your mouth shut and keep your motherfucking Chakras open\nKeep your all seeing eye open)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/452b7e323e94c8b5f917784303b84357.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
