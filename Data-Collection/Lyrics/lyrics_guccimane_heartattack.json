That's just the shit my boo wear\nI'm so inconsiderate, I'm not even caring\nI got them big old diamond chains and thinking about marriage\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nHeart attack, baby when you roll\nYou gone give me a heart attack\nDon't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack\nGotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack\nI ain't never ever poppin back\nI just want me a heart attack\nHeart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack\nHeart attack, heart attack, heart attack\nPicture me not doing well from a heart attack, from a heart attack", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/4b576ea1afe2f0e254d3dfe5747788bc.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
