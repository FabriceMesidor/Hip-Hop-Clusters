(Girls) Call your friends (call your friends)\nLet the top back and we can take a spin\nRoll it up and we can blow it in the wind\nWhat you need? (What you need?) We'll hit the mall (we'll hit the mall)\nTell your man you gon' holla at him tomorrow\nAnd later on I'ma show you how to ball\nBut tonight shorty we gon' do it all, so\n\n[Interlude: Rico Love]\nWhat you waitin on? I'ma come and get you\nGirl just hit me when you're leavin the club\nDon't put them panties on, girl you ain't gon' need 'em\nCause I promise I'll be tearin it up\n\n[Chorus: Rico Love]\nCause we don't make love, we be makin movies\nWe don't make love, we be makin movies\nGirl this ain't a tub, we in the jacuzzi\nWatchin all the suds run down on your booty\nWe don't make love, we be makin movies\nWe don't make love, we be makin movies\nGirl this ain't a tub, we in the jacuzzi\nWatchin all the suds run down on your booty\nTurn the lights on\n\n[Nelly]\nBack it up, bend over, put it on me girl then drop\nGo for what you know cause I love it when you on top\nIt's excitin when you bitin, you fightin to get that spot\nYou can get that guap, as long as you don't stop\nOn your back with your legs up\nAll up in the air, just keep 'em right there\nYou won't find nothin better\nYou're dealin with a player, the man right chea girl\n\n[Interlude] + [Chorus]\n\n[Nelly]\nI don't care, let 'em stare, they gon' be the audience\nWe gon' be the superstars, we'll perform for all of them\nYou gon' scream my name and I'll put your name in the lights\nI'ma change your life, stay with me tonight\nOhhhhhh\n\n[Chorus] - repeat 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3455d80c0949060bbaa5eccb85982765.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
