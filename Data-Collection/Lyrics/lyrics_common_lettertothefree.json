Lord willing!\nFor now we know, the new Jim Crow\nThey stop, search and arrest our souls\nPolice and policies patrol philosophies of control\nA cruel hand taking hold\nWe let go to free them so we can free us\nAmerica's moment to come to Jesus\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nThe caged birds sings for freedom to ring\nBlack bodies being lost in the American dream\nBlood of black being, a pastoral scene\nSlavery's still alive, check Amendment 13\nNow whips and chains are subliminal\nInstead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'\nSweet land of liberty, incarcerated country\nShot me with your ray-gun\nAnd now you want to trump me\nPrison is a business, America's the company\nInvesting in injustice, fear and long suffering\nWe staring in the face of hate again\nThe same hate they say will make America great again\nNo consolation prize for the dehumanized\nFor America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives\nAnd we gonna free them, so we can free us\nAmerica's moment to come to Jesus\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)\nFreedom (Freedom)\nFreedom come (Freedom come)\nHold on (Hold on)\nWon't be long (Won't be long)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4d39e6aabe015fe73b43e8f5268e4286.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
