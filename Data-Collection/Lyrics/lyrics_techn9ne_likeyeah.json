Yeah, I think they with me, mayne\nYeah, yeah, this is Kansas City, mayne\nThe industry's still punks, that's why they real slump\nBut when we in this drop, all our records we will dump\nHavin' a good time, just stackin' 'em with Travis, we laid back\nDoin' about a hundred fifty with slaps in the Maybach\nHaters, of course ya doubt that I'm makin' a warped amount\nI got Ozone, Murder Dog, double XL and Source accounts\n(So what's all the force about?) Killer in and remorse is out!\nFuck Mark Cerami, you heard that from the horse's mouth\nThat ain't comin' from RBC, that ain't comin' from Fontana\nIt's comin' from Strange Music's Dontana in a calm manner\nI'll say this in baritone, (\"We come to get our cheddar!\")\nHuntin' you in yo' dreams, you wake up screamin' in falsetto\nMTV clipped me, birthday bash show\nI got fans like cat castro that'll boost my cash flow!\nMTV, completely, we sick of it, you won't give a bit?\nJust look at my eyes and my blood and my ligaments\nYou can see that Tecca Nina don't give a shit\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\n(K-I-L-L) E to the R, a dot!\nJust ain't fair that when I pop up the spot be like, \"YEAH!\"\nKiller, killer, it's the gorilla\nAnd if they feel ya they screamin' like\n\"Yeah!
