What do you do?\nHoes ain't callin' like you want\nOnly ones you got passed\nNo one here, on your own\nStuck in the same spot\nWhat do you do? What do you do?\n\n[Refrain: ScHoolboy Q]\nHoes ain't callin'\nThe cocaine rock\nWorld keep spinnin'\nThe block stay hot\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nReally with it for real\nWe fuckin' hoes for real\nGettin' paper for real, nigga\nI play for the bills, nigga\nI really sold pills\nSmokin' weed for my ills\nBreakin' weed in my whip\nJust got an ounch on a bitch\nStill our motive be commas\nAnd still my life isn't promised\nStill nervous as drivers\nYou see them lights get behind us\nThey pull me out for my priors\nWon't let me freeze 'fore they fire\nYou say that footage a liar\nThey want my flow in the dryer\nI'm at the top aimin' higher\nMy lawyers stay on retainer\nWhen white folks point the finger\nPlace my neck on that hanger\nShit, no wonder we riot\nNiggas still killin' niggas\nChild support killin' niggas\nCops enslavin' us niggas\nLittle girls killin' mothers\nThey treat their kid like a brotha\nFathers stuck with them lifers\nKept it real with his niggas\nBut left his kid for the suckas, shit no wonder we bang\nDamn shame, mane, some things will never change\n\n[Hook: SZA]\nWho you do when you want?\nBoy think you got this\nNo one here, on your own\nStuck in the same spot\nWhat do you do? What do you do?\nHoes ain't callin' like you want\nOnly ones you got passed\nNo one here, on your own\nStuck in the same spot\nWhat do you do?
