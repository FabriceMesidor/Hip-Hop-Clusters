Don't call me!)\n(Repeat)\n\n[DMX]\nDon't call me brother, we ain't got the same mother\nOr the same father, you get down like the other\nDon't speak on wisdom when you know you don't love her\nDon't shake my hand when you wanna see me under\nDon't talk slick behind my back\nDon't walk like this when you act like that\nYou tryna bark on when instead you a cat\nCome to your hood like \"BAP! BAP! BAP!\"\nMess with the kid if you want to\nBut your mans and them tell you it'll be the last thing that you would do\nYou built like a scooter, I'm built like a hummer\nWas built like a tank, you don't want it baby, uh uh\nStop playing with D, it'll get you hurt\nYou a girl, you can't play in the dirt, you wear a skirt\nYou don't know a damn thing about putting in work\nWith your whole effin blocks up the murder type, arf\n\n[Chorus]\n[DMX]\nGrrr\nIt's a start\nAnd they don't know what it is\nTHEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS!\n\nAY! (14X)\n\n[Shontelle]\nNo no no\n\n[Chorus till fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
