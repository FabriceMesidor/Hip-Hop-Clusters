Uh-huh\nYou see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton\nAsk me what I have accomplished, I don't know, I don't have conscience\nI just load up and start dumping on enemies; I'm head huntin'\nNo sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets, just get something\nProtect your neck 'cause they coming for sets, respect, split your onion\nThen chop your deck your head tumbling like gymnastics\n('Cause ignorance is bliss)\n\n[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]\nNow everybody put your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nThis the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far, from a discharge\nBut never will I diss ya'll\nWe all tryna ball, and when I got the rock I'll dish off\nUntil the day I pistol whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off, then peel off\nIn a hooptie, come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me\nAnd they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me\nIndubitably, I'm too street\u2014indubitably, I'ma do me\nBetter than your bitch would\nBut you niggas too weak, but just give me two weeks and I'm good\nI'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm\nMake Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent\nNo tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish\nNot only from the rap game, I'm including the planet\nCats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic\nTie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic\nGive me respect, damnit, or get damaged\nDie young, corpse identified by your parents\nApparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint\nBut I won't share it just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff\nStop it, I'm hearin' the comments\nThe critics are calling me conscious\nBut truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton\nSo truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?\nProves that ignorance is bliss\n\n[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]\nNow everybody put your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off\nThis my world, I grab the universe then play kickball\nAnd they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard\nI'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call\nGhostbusters to shoot busters, I'm Casper when I go off\nI show up, to show out and show off, you a hundred percent behind me\nAnd if you are, then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene\nI remember bein' 17, wishin' someone would sign me\nNow the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me\nBackin' down bargains, backin' down bitches\nWe gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her\n'Cause ignorance is bliss\nAnd, Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats, I bleed out the speaker\nAs the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e1efc6d0a7044dbf2f0776a12ed85b8.620x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
