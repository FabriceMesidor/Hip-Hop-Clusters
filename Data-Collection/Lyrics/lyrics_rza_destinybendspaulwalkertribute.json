You were set free from your worries\nNow you are gone in the breeze\nGone in the trees\nI thought we had another day to smile and laugh\nIn the wind, how can it end?\nI\u2019m grateful to meet you, may we meet again\nPaul, my friend\n\n[Hook: Will Wells]\nOn that highway\nWhere heaven\nBegins\nI lost a friend\u2026\n\n[Bridge: Will Wells]\nBut destiny\nBends, bends\nBut destiny bends\nYea, it bends\nI lost a friend\nFriend\u2026\nOn that highway to heaven\n\n[Verse 2: Will Wells]\nYou will drive in the wind\nAnd you\u2019ll surf in the seas\nOh how can this be?\nYou were set free from your worries\nNow you are gone in the breeze\nGone in the trees\nYour soul is set free\nI thought we had another day to smile and to laugh\nIn the wind, how can it end?\nI\u2019m thankful to meet you, may we meet again\nPaul, my friend\nPaul, my friend\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0050e4b1c52ecca6d63818331b489e2a.683x683x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
