bit\n\n[Chorus]\nChillin' with my homies and we vibin\u2019\nAll this potion that I'm sippin', I ain\u2019t drivin'\nLife a motherfucker, but we still survivin'\nColored people time, but nigga, we still arrivin'\nChillin' with my homies and we vibin'\nAll this potion that I'm sippin', I ain\u2019t drivin\u2019\nLife a motherfucker, but we still survivin'\nColored people time, but nigga, we still arrivin\u2019 (Ayy, yeah, ayy)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm feelin' like Andre pre-3K 'cause all I got is Benjamins\nY\u2019all know the regiment R-A-double-T-P-A-C-K\nRappin' like back in the day, yeah, you heard what I say\nFrom EBT and watchin' BET on my TV to platinum CD\nNow I got it like that, the boy brought it like that\nYeah they gon' bring it back\nLike the illest sample from the '70s, I'm feelin' heavenly\nGrew up in Maryland and now my neighbor is Beverley\nEven when Bobby Boy over the hill and he's 70\nI'ma be packin' that weaponry, I am the greatest alive\nYou already know it, I don't gotta say it, this shit is telepathy\nIf you feel different, then step to me\n'Cause I've been ballin, shot-callin'\nDroppin' heat back to back while y'all stallin'\nY'all wanna ante up, but I'm all-in\nClimbin' the ladder, ain't no way I'm fallin'\nCome here, my darlin', married to the game\nCome now, feel the pain\nBut I got a side bitch and that's real\nWe love to make movies, I told you, that's reel\nThat's just how I feel\nTell me what I, tell me what I really wanna give for a life like this\nNo, the boy won't fade away\nTake it day-to-day, everybody wanna hate straight-away\nThat's how we livin' in the world today\nI'm Louis, you more C.K.\nWas a outcast on the come up back in the day\nAnd now I'm more Andre post-3K, like woo\n\n[Chorus]\nBreak it down\nBreak-break-break-break-break it down\nBreak it down (Can I kick it?)\nBreak-break-break-break-break it down\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, ayo\nFuck you like Cee-Lo, buck it then I reload\nSippin' Pellegrino, shoot the shit like Tarantino (Break it down)\nIn the cut like Lilo with everybody we know\nWe all in together like we cousins in the '90s\nAnd if you don't know 'bout that shit\nThen you don't know 'bout rap shit, that's jack shit (Yeah)\nYou ain't got a nickel, son, yeah, I said that's Jack shit\nYou ain't got a dime dog, you dropped it, that's rat shit\nStab you in the back shit, ratchet\nMy style is impeccable and nobody could match it\nI'm Bruce Wayne terrorizin' Gotham, I'm batshit\nI'm Kim Kardashian with a hatchet\nConstantly reshapin' this body of work, I'm an introvert\nWonder why I smoke dope, no wonder why I can't cope\n(Break it down)\nFar from evil, I'm kinda like Spike Spiegel\nA cowboy paid for retrieval\nBitches jumpin' to conclusions like Evil Knievel\nBest believe you, bitch, I'll leave you stranded\nTry to dap me up left-handed\nI'll leave you defeated and amputated 'til the blood coagulated\nI force the crowd to throw they hands up like cannibals\nMy God, what a fuckin' animal\nSicker than givin' brain to Hannibal Lecter\nYou come correct but I come correcter\nFood for thought, but hold the lecture\nAyo, I kill the pussy, yeah I make sehctib cremate\nI'm an original screenplay in a world full of remakes\nI record my shit the first time, you need more than three takes\nLyrically, I'm undefined on this fuckin' beat tape, my god\n\n[Chorus]\nBreak-break-break-break-break-break-break-break-break-break\nBreak it down\nBreak-break-break-break-break-break-break-break-break-break\nBreak it down\n\n[Outro]\nOkay\n\u30b3\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9\uff08\u30b3\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30ba\uff09\u30aa\u30d6\u30c7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30e9\u30b9\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\n\u3054\u53c2\u52a0\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u6700\u9ad8\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01\uff1f\n\u697d\u3057\u3093\u3067\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u305f\u3053\u3068\u3092\u9858\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3082\u3057\u3001\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u304a\u6c17\u306b\u53ec\u3055\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u8033\u3092\u585e\u3050\u304b\u3001\u5e30\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3044\u3066\u7d50\u69cb\u3002\n\u3067\u3082\u305d\u3093\u306a\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306f\u30ed\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u611b\u3057\u3066\u3084\u307e\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u6bce\u65e5\u3001\u5f7c\u306e\u884c\u52d5\u304c\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u4ed5\u65b9\u306a\u3044\u306f\u305a\u3002\n\u304a\u305d\u3089\u304f\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u6c17\u4ed8\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3046\u3061\u306b\u865c\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306d\u3002\n\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u3067\u8074\u3044\u3066\u308b\u3001RattPack
