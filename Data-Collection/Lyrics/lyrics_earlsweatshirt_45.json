You should bet 'em on him\nCall the vet he barking, hear him and the mess he started\nNigga, they keep a eye on me, I am not a child artist\nI raised the bar and hit a chin-up for a while on it\nLife a long ride, my niggas up for it\nMy bitches down for me cause I stay a buck-fifty\nAngel City drought time, why the fuck I'm up fifty\nPlaying like I'm down five? They can't really fuck with me\nLet a nigga sizzle in the pan if he wanna\nLos Angeles area annual summer, we burning under it\nLearned from taking chances and fumbling\nNigga I was taught to take your rations and guzzle 'em, bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6abe116b40a921476ff1094726c8d1a8.608x608x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Earl Sweatshirt"}
