Bobby, I'm floating in your galaxy)\n\n[Verse 1: Holocaust]\nYou falling down a endless tunnel of doom reality\nGraphically my Killa Bee family stings the galaxy\nInsanity, titanium stomach devouring Guinness\nMy flesh is solid stone despite my outer appearance\nStill disease kills viruses, planets and racial creatures\nMade MCs sprout tumours so bad, lost facial features\nWaste your peoples left out in the rain, fountains of pain\nEighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name\nHolocaust, black man whose veins littered with thorns\nBack smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed\nSwarm dorms, sting birds, fling verbs like mean curves\nStrike three, mics flee, I infect 'em with green germs\nRingworm cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly mastery\nMy felony melody has to be a bastard's masterpiece\nStop grafting me, chump-ass niggas eyeing me, tempt me\nI'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty\nSpitting darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hideout\nRock crush or German suplex, watch spines slide out\nThe side route, forearm bash with twenty jabs\nOn the ave or your lab, get stabbed and bloodied bad\nWhile I'm sipping herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds\nBitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees\nCircle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus\nGot Oscar nominee MCs stuck to my hatchet\nDrastic indescribable pain, I injure bars\nWhile Bobby's throwing razor CDs like ninja stars\n\n[Break: RZA]\nChick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh\nYo, yo, drop down a manhole, yo I rap ammo\nBlows out your candle, check, yo\n\n[Verse 2: RZA]\nDrop down a manhole, I rap ammo, blows out your candle\nHave Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Gano\nRelease the info, .44 increase your heart tempo\nScared your ass, you jumped through a closed window\nTo a hundred beats per a second, my mic's secret weapon\nInfuriate your style to that of Led Zeppelin\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, Hanna-Barbera\nWorld of Super Adventure couldn't give a proper word\nOf the scripture of my manner\nYou're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal\nMCs delight popcorn, we popping every kernel\nJot this in your journal, we hot like a thermal\nNuclear explosion, undermine control of your country\nLike the Federal Enforcement Management Agency\nMy technique be vocabulary freak\nC-cyphers say my divine is like Dante's Peak\nAt most, you'll be trapped off in Patmos\nGet smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast\nKing Cobra black brew pack and bare foot\nOn the roof dusted out, waiting for chariots\nPopping like Orville Redenbacher or Betty Crocker\nThe Pop Secret is the .45 Glock popper\nControl men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard\nAmerican Express privileges, blood spillage\nWe got more bars then billets, Star-Spangled Banner\nSoldier stand up, Cobra Commander stop the propaganda\nThirty shot banana clip, full-loaded, radar scanners get decoded\nDigital warfare torments your head, eyes bloated\nHeads exploded, poison darts quoted\nAmerican eagle stinging up Blue Beetle Bailey\nOn the rocks mixed with Hennessey daily\nKeep thee scaly Israeli niggas from the Clan\nWe ride the Amistad & harness the promised land\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Doom]\nYou can't escape from the Doctor of Doom, my lyrics zoom on buffoons\nAnd take flight like witches brooms at full moon\nOn all you Dum-Dums, wash your filthy rhymes away like soap scum\nThe warlord swing flaming swords just like a shogun\nOf the darkness, my scriptures cause arson like flaming arches\nMy Killa Bee sting remains accurate like a marksman\nSo take precaution, we attack like black Martians\nCorner the market by using digital strategies\nReefer sparks my acid battery, y'all niggas flatter me\nWith all that tough talk, I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock\nFrom the outside or the inside, create intense rides\nWhen my pen glides all MCs will get their head fly\nFor talking shit, lyrics always strike throughout my dungeon pit\nKilla Bees must reign supreme throughout the continent\nWe conquered it, motherfuckers\n\n[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]\nThe beat terminal, exquisite young Cooley High production\nCaught up in the hollow head suction\nTen pogo sticks, two black belts that break bricks\nDiet Coke meetings with the rich, I'm faithfully\nMarried to Rap, we've been engaged for twelve years\nTyson bit Holyfield's ear, we love the sport\nLook out your window, now see, pull up the shade\nY'all be amazed, me Tony Starks spaceship\nRan by a Duracell, the only man out walked through Hell\nDick swinging like shit went well\nCall it the mighty Joe Young, double swirl slush\nWonder Woman's sapphire shit with the pearls\nIt looked real nice yo, heavy on the gravy\nDirt bagged the secretary in the graze\nShe typed eighty words from whirlwinds to whirlpools\nOpenly sea, watch the Earth spin, Sunny dance with the serpent\nWho shot JJ it was Mudbone, the same nigga riding the train\nSame nigga with his name on his jacket\nSwift and changeable, inhaled the bad bag of that Jason\nFell out twice in the basement, straight up and down y'all", "image":
