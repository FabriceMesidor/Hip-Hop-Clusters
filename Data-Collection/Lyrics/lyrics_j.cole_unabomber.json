Or will it pass?\nJust as quick as it came\nHoes knowing my name\nDog, welcome to fame\nI pray to God we don't change\nBut even if you don't\nMost niggas look at you strange\nBut I guess I can't complain (Hey)\nHey man it's happening fast\nI say it's happening fast\nI say it's happening fast", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d75165afed097efe5c123d56cef54f0a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
