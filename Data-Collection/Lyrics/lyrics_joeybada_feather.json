I'm tokin'\nAnd if you fly, then you gonna see me floatin'\nFuturistic shit, stuntin' in the hovercraft\nMe plus a girl who really wanna do the aftermath\nCause all I can do is just laugh hahaha\nListen: laugh, laugh last; laughin at you rappers\nI troop on your swag cause I'm a snack-rapper\nShe found out I wasn't rappin', wanted to lick the wrapper\nGave me axe instead of gifts, like I'm the gift-wrapper\nSo I reel her in, in like a snapper\nShe started to do her dance, booty-clappin' like a clapper\nShe started talkin' cuffing, she really started acting up\nI did the ghost, and I was gone like Casper\nLike my momma tell me not to mess with these hoes\nI'mma tell you rookies don't mess with no Pro\nSo money, cars, and clothes be all a nigga knows\nThere ain't no lyin', I'm the truth, you can tell by my nose\nAin't no Pinocchios\nAnd that's just how the story goes\nSo please stay tuned for the rest of the show", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04d0b6e6105201632be0a45e1968ba75.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
