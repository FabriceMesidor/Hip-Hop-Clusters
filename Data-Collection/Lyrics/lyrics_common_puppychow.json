A Woody Woodpecker\nYou need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker\nIntersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum\nI manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb\nIf you got some, just an eensy BIT of game\nThen it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame\nI shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally\nTell em that I get the drawers come off immediately\nHere comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut\nAnd be that I'm a mutt -- so what?\nNo but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to\nIt's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin\nDown the street, watchin ladies\nNobody's watchin you, because you got a baby\nI ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother\nWord to mommy dearest, I look farther\nDown the road, to a road not taken\nI'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care\nA new flower, so Joe can take a shower\nAnd get wet, and then jet\nLike ahhhh, seven-forty-seven\nI tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven\nThen I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear\n\"Is Common there?\" Uh-uh, sorry\nYou got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack\nChoppin down the cherry tree and never comin back\nIt's like that and it'll be like that\nBecause a dog is a woman's best friend black", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e3b1b8cdac9f386a42441991d28a760b.624x624x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
