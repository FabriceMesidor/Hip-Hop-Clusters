You see, someone gotta lose\nI thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?\nWhat good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?\nAnd what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?\nNight's fallin', lights glowing\nAnd I'm just trying to pay the price owing\nAnd I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing\nAnd I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments\nNigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision\n'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision\nSo I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants\n'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear\n\n[Chorus]\nSo can you do me a favor?\nIf I pull it together, make it sooner than later\nWe won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long\nBut please don't move on\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else\nYou don't need no one else\n(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)\nYou don't need no one else, oh\nYou don't need no one else", "image": "https://images.genius.com/83ad0a4cdf492e299e507a370ad173a4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
