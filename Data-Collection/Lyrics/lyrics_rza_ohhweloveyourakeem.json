The cooty and the chair\nFlex and I flex on the opposite sex\nHit 'em off quick and step to the next\nIt seems I'm a fiend for a sex routine\nLove to hear them scream\n(Woman: Ohh Rakeem)\nAnd my response is \"Oh\"\nAlways satisfy them, you know how I flow\nBut since I'm not lazy, I'm buck wild and crazy\nI kiss the bosoms, but never eat the daisies\nAnd my ladies love me deeply\nBecause I'm handsome, charming and freaky\nAnd when they need me, they won't go\nAnd now I'm stuck, I should've said no\n\nChorus 2:\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: And I love you to\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: Thank you\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: Your far too kind\nWoman: Ohh Rakeem\nRakeem: Gosh\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: You feeling mutual love\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: Oh do you?\nWoman: Ohh we love you Rakeem\nRakeem: Hmmmmm\nWoman: Ohh Rakeem\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I walk down the block\nThe girls stop and clock\nThey hop on my jock, cause I got mad props\nTall & slim with the brown skin conflection\nHalf them sweating my love and affection\nAs I collect them, I must want to protect them\nLove them deeply, but never disrespect them\nI keep a tab on the large amount\nBut sometimes I find myself losing count\nOf Latika, Diane, Lisa\nStephanie, Jackie, Teresa\nSharonda, um um, Veronica\nLatasha, Sinthia & Monica\nNevertheless, you must give respect\nTo the femine queens that the God selects\nI love them all, but even though\nI'm rather happy, I should've said no\nBut yet my ego gets in the way\nAnd always something that I'll never say\nI'd just bag them, keep 'em under my wing\nPut them in a posse, and let them all sing\n\nChorus 2(Rakeem saying these lines instead)\nDo you?\nSay it again baby\nYes I like it\nCome on you can say it louder\nCuz I love you all\nThank you\nRakeem Allah the greatest baby\n\nChorus 1(to the end)(Rakeem talking in the back)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b9de29dee1a5b6dcb8d879daf5fd9484.493x478x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
