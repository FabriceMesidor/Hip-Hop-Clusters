that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou told me \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in the eye\nAnd I gave you a chance even though you not my type\nShe told me \"I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night\"\nThen treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes\nBut I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou said that \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in my eye\"\n(We gon', we gon') I told her \"We gon' be alright\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nWoah, and I just lost my job\nYeah, I've been stressin', hoped that I could talk to God, wait\nCause lately conversations with you kinda crucial\nEver since I got laid off, you don't treat me like you used to, no\n(You know how much I love you) But now my backs to the wall\nKinda hard to believe when you make it seem like you not havin' a ball\nYou make it harder for me when you wanna leave but I miss havin' your all\nYou ain't talkin' to me and it's been a week and I ain't happy at all\nListen, it's been way too long and you been actin' funny\nYou say shit, like you'd bend over backwards for me\nShit we've been back and forth since last December\nWe break up, but it don't matter cause we get right back together\nI remember, I remember you said\n\n[Chorus]\nWe gon' be alright\nI gave you a chance even though you not my type\nI did some things that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou told me \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in the eye\nAnd I gave you a chance even though you not my type\nShe told me \"I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night\"\nThen treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes\nBut I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou said that \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in my eye\"\n(We gon', we gon') I told her \"We gon' be alright\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhoa, and my homie said he heard you complain about me\nAnd I've been stressin', hopin' that you feel the same about me\nCause lately conversations with you kinda crucial\nEver since I got laid off, you don't fuck me like you used to, no\n(And you know we could be so good together) Okay, back to the basics\nI love when you tell me you trust me and don't want to go back to the fake shit\nYou fuss and I get all my stuff and I move back down to the basement\nAnd plus I don't wanna be the one to be givin' up right now when I'm anxious\nI've been thinkin', I've been down since days you ain't had no money\nYou say shit like you'd bend over backwards for me\nShit we've been back and forth since last December\nWe break up but it don't matter cause we get right back together\nI remember, I remember you said\n\n[Chorus]\nWe gon' be alright\nI gave you a chance even though you not my type\nI did some things that I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou told me \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in the eye\nAnd I gave you a chance even though you not my type\nShe told me \"I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night\"\nThen treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes\nBut I did some things that a nigga ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\n(I gave you a chance) Okay, I'll never leave your side\nYou had some shit that you were goin' through and you ain't even cry\nSo if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice\nYou said that \"Next time there won't be no next time\", looked me in my eye\"\n(We gon', we gon') I told her \"We gon' be alright\"\n\n[Bridge]\nWe gon', we gon', we gon' be alright\nI'm about to be done with your bullshit\nI gave you a chance even though you not my type\nI don't know why you keep doing this to me\nWe gon', we gon', we gon' be alright\nI gave you a chance even though you not my type, uh\nHow many times do I have to keep saying the same thing over and over again?\nWe gon', we gon' be alright\nI gave you a chance even though you not my type\nYou're literally doing nothing for us\nI did some things I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side\nYou're just being selfish\nWe gon', we gon', we gon' be alright, done\n\n[Voicemail]\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\nI'm unable to take your call right now\nLeave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace\n\n[Message]\n(*Hesitated response*)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/895cf32a9779b29f3e18b6c7cb55b3e2.500x500x1.jpg"}],
