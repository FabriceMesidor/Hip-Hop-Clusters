I did that\nPut it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had\nYou held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats\nYou precious, more precious than lost treasure\nMatter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see you dressed up in white face covered in veil\nDo I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwing rice\nAnd it's the day that your father give you away\nTo a real man that gently put the ring on your hand\nDo we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to\nNow, look me in my eyes and say I do\nDriving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates\nWe can spend our honeymoon in the States\nYou can throw your friend the bouquet\nSomething in the back of my head say\nFor us two, maybe cause I love you\nHug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you\nAs long as we together it's heaven for me to please you\nWon't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful\nDeeper and harder love laying new with you\nRunning my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by\nWhile I'm with you and I won't even care, word\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's\nColombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas\nThug ones to those soft as baby shit\nShe been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips\n'Til one day she decided to flip\nIt was nutting I can do about it, like she the boss and shit\nStarted talking this divorcing shit\nI gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake\nHalf my car, half my kids? Can't get that\nTried to swing on the God, had to dip that\nYo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that\nAll she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass\nHad to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look\nWith a fine-ass body and a damn good cook\nFor some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too\nYou my queen, God bless you\n\n[Chorus]\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nGirl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G\nI remember the first time, girl, you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G\nPicture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73b36e02ac974c8ab4a3cd49a9cf1794.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
