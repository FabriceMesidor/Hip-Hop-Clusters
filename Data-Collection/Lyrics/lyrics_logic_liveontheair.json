I'll choke you to death with your own shoelaces\nPsych, I swear I'm not a violent guy\nOnce upon time I brought a Super Soaker to a drive-by\nFull of Kool-Aid and warm piss\nMy buzz is growing every day and when the swarm hits\nMillion dollar trips, sex at the Ritz\nSo rich I'll make bitches show Charlie Murphy their tits\nBlow the competition to bits, leavin' the enemy lit\nBut I'm out cause there's women to please and money to get\nIt's Logic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6118bfdbbde22320e3c6bc130e1772d3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
