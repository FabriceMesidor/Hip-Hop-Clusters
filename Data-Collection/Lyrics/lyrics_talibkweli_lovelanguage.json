track\nSo, whenever you hear the word love\nKnow that, it's going to be in a different language\nThe language of love cannot be translated, yo\n\n(Verse 1 Talib Kweli)\nLove is blind, you just see bright light\nYou up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type\nBlood rushing to your heart making it beat\nWhen she swept you off your feet and made it complete\nYou know the plan you had to conquer the world\nThinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl\nAnd now you found her\nStarted with romantic, then got to frantic\nThen things thats normally small become gigantic\nNow y'all sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic\nBeing with you like a habit, without you I can't stand it\nIt's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic\nWithout understanding that you never had it try to grab it\nIn the bed gettin a nut off, communication cut off\nGetting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off\nConstantly comparing you to someone in my past\nWe don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash\nAdvance to that physical shit\nSee what happens if you keep talkin\nSee what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf...\nYo, see what I'm sayin'\nIt's like one big mind game that everybody playin and\nNiggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is\nWe just don't understand our fundamental differences\nI'm still learning though, actually\nI just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally\n\n(Chorus Les Nubians)\nL'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)\nRestes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)\nJ'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)\nEt je t'ai trouve (And I found you)\n\n(Verse 2 Talib Kweli)\nWomen thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge\nSo when we arguin nobody win\nWords get in the way time and again\nSticks and stones break your bones words break your heart\nWhether you in touch with that part or not say \"word\"\nWords are weapons for the revolutionary\nUsed for evil make the situation very scary\nWord up, but love is brave\nIt flies in the face of fear\nYo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there\nLet's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto\nKnow more about survival than the one from fresh meadows\nIt got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin from\nSpit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums\nWord (te quiero) I put my love into my music\nIf you with me then you love how I do it\nIf my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in\nNever drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion\nLove potion overdosin approachin\nThe explosion of my senses everyday without your heart\nIs like a sentence in jail\nTrust I'll always be mentally free\nYou got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be\nLove {*different language*} it ain't nuttin but a word\nA chicken ain't nuttin but a bird\nYo, yo, yo\n\n(Chorus Les Nubians)\nL'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)\nRestes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)\nJ'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)\nEt je t'ai trouve (And I found you)\n\n(Verse 3 Talib Kweli)\nSome of y'all in love with that material but\nLove enter my life like a miracle and\nIt reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love\nWe exibit our natural behavior\nLike making love under the moon in Jamaica\nGet you so hot you call the name of the creata\nThe morning we hop back into action again\nUp on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin\nRemember when we explored the beach\nSwam in the ocean and saw beneith\nHow the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice\nThat's what your beauty remind me of\nIt's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above\nThem other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though\nKnow in my heart that we connected so I let it go\nNow if they call you out your name and that's a different thing\nAnything but Queen I'll go to war like a King\nYour friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band\nBut they dont understand\nSome things is meant to stay between a woman and man\nAnd they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it\nBoth you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid\nWe speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish\nSome don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted\nOut they joint like \"Shit, he payin for your rent\" missin the point\nWhen you rub me into your skin just like an ointment\nIt's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated\nLearn how to speak it, and become emancipated\nIt's a language\n\nUniversal love...\n\n(Chorus Les Nubians)\nL'amour n'a pas de, frontiere (Love has no boundaries)\nRestes car je t'aime comme tu es (Stay because I love you as you are)\nJ'ai traverse l'ocean du verbe (I crossed an ocean of words)\nEt je t'ai trouve (And I found you)\n\nLove love love love, love, love (Repeated)", "image":
