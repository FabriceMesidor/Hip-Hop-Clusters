(What!)\nUhh, where my dogs at?! (They not ready!)\nC'mon! (This hip-hop)\nWhere my dogs at?!\n\nYou can try but I do fight, just can't seem to do right\nCan't run with the big dogs, those jeans are too tight\nI been doin this for too long, plus dog is too strong\nLet you cats, bite me off the map, with a new song\nMan you know you wrong, tryin that shit there\nYeah, a nigga went there, all you did was sit there\nI've been rappin about 20 years and you 20 years old\nX is back on the block, lookin to go gold\nThere's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected\nYou ain't gotta like it but respect it, nigga check it!\nI'ma get it in until the nigga wins with the dividends\nCause, we gon' walk the dogs, 'til the bitter end\nYou like, \"Oh it's him again!\" I knew that's how you felt\n[sniff] Pussy! I knew that's how you smelled\nAll you cats do is play around, with your speech\nTalkin 'bout, what you got, ain't air in the teeth\nYou can, put on a vest but, I'ma still stop ya\nCause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter\nAnd niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk\nWe gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump\nWhether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready\nHalf from here to here, lookin like spaghetti\nPull out the machete, hack off the limbs\nBag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs\nJump in the Benz, five cars deep\n4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep\nShut shit down whenever we hit town\nGIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down\nYou can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst\nYou gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse\nNiggas play poker, I play poke-her\nHit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
