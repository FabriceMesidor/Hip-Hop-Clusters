New Trojan in the building/\nWe ride with no limits/\nShut the fuck up, don't you hear me trying to finish?/\nI'm in a bad mood, rob that dude/\nFuck that couch, burn that house/\nWe the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror/\n4,000 on the leather, you niggas should know better/\nThem niggas new slaves, i do say.../\nFuck! Fuck! twice, only on a Tuesday/\nWhen i'm in a bad mood/\nOoh nigga i'm wylin on 'em/\nOoh back balling on 'em/\nI never feel the pain/\nOnly God can make it rain/\nSo i must be Mary, Joseph, Allah/\nKid of a disciple, thoughts are suicidal/\nJumping off the building, thinking like a psycho/\nThey trying to find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty/\nIt's alright, he's after the meds, Chris Bobby/\n...Oh shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62d241389823ea14f6a4612f37e29db8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Travis Scott"}
