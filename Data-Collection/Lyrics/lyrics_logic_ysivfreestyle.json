Pass the Philly, get silly, that's on the really\nWe snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talking Achilles\nTry to play me like I ain't me but I provided all the deets\nWho you know worth $50 million still rapping on breakbeats?\nFrom Nasty Nas, Big L, Tribe, the Roots, and many more\nOf course, we could never forget Biggie and Young Shakur\nFuck the police, no, we ain't fucking with our pastor\nI'm the bastard that mastered the flow, said it once before for sure\nWhile 6ix produce hits from the soul, you already know\nVisualising and realising my life is fucking crazy\nPoppin' like Jay-Z, dirty dancing on the game like Swayze\nI'm one of the illest, and bitch, I've been ready to kill this, it's so amazing\nBitch, I've been blazing, I'm talking grass, I ain't talking grazing\nLatest shit the tape while I sip scotch, let the haters kick rocks\nMy flow is tip-top; I never flip flop, why? 'Cause my soul too strong\nDid this all on my own 'cause waiting took too long\nThe flow sophisticated\nAll these youngins do is whine like they inebriated\nI'm hated, but yeah, that's how you know I made it\nI'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest\nI'm ready to kill this, the people they feel this\nMe and my team made millions but you know we still us\nYeah, they wanna kill us but they all feel us\nRattPack real all the time, we never phony\nI'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony\nWhile the rest of these rappers is acting\nPass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar\nFrom the new school rappers, Logic's the illest on the roster\nSmoke like a rasta\nBlack and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley\nThese racist motherfuckers hate that last line\nProbably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain\nSaid I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the Garden\nSinatra\n\n[Outro]\nYoung Sinatra IV, the album\nSeptember 28th\nBringing that boom bap back for the RattPack", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
