She need an ass whippin'\nI was told Ton' was home, I'm way past fifth and\nGuess it's time to get in my zone, this my last mission\nDid what I could do with this pump and I'm like fuck it\nFeelin' like Hammer on crutches, he can't touch this\nIllustrious, multi movements\nI drew the blueprints but now it's time for improvements\nPress his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful\nShit police do, we could never be a equal\nExecution, I get it in, retribution\nBest solution, get up close when you're shootin'\nShit for realler, I'm mad raw with a killer\nWhat's even iller, I knew the boss since Thriller\n'Til we're even, I guess it's gon' be grievin'\nA lot can change in 36 seasons\n\nSometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle\nRight in front of your face, stop the hustle\nTake off the muzzle, let the dogs bark\nClear your mind, bring the light to the dark\n\nSometimes you gotta figure out the pieces to the puzzle\nRight in front of your face, stop the hustle\nTake off the muzzle, let the dogs bark\nClear your mind, bring the light to the dark", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
