your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\n\n[Verse 1: Trina]\nYou know what I need\nSomebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit (Alright)\nAnd a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP\nAnd I'll make him go and get my shit\nWe can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville\nHotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill\nA real nigga not the run of the mill\nCome and spank me and make me shoot to kill\nFrom the kitchen then you can move me\nTo the jacuzzi and out the booty\nCome and do your duty\nMe and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie\nBare naked in a bed of cash\nMake st-st-sttutter when I bare my ass\nTell your baby momma bye, she a thing of the past\nCause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)\nHaving sex in lil' jets menag\u00e9 tois\nGetting buck wild no matter where we are\nIndie 500 in the back of the car\nIn a dark ass club or on the back of a bar\nNever want, never ever wanna leave\nWork for me like league overseas\nI want a man to fulfill my needs\nTo keep my body trembling and buckle my knees\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\n\n[Verse 2: Shawnna]\nI wanna do it on the canopy\nI wanna do it where your girl gon' see, and get mad at me\nI want a nigga that'll grab the weave\nAnd turn my eyes Chinese\nTell me baby can you handle me?\nI wanna do it all in your mouth\nThen I'll pull the ass out\nMake it bounce 'til you pass out\nOr we can cut up in the grass\nAnd give the neighbors a flash\nCan you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?\nSaid I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib\nAnd I wanna do all the things, do all the things that I never did\nLike up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head\nOr you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red\nI like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide\nPolo down with them blades on the ride\nKeepin' the pound with them K's on the side\nBut it's okay I'm gon break something tonight\nOh see get on your knees\nAnd I'll show you what's my fantasy\nLike up in the coupe, coupe\nTell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris & Foxy Brown]\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\nBut I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\nYou gotta li li li lick me from my ass to my clit\nThen you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick\nAnd I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff\nAnd then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]\nI'm a BK bitch, love to ride dick\nAss in his face, cock spread out\nNigga uptown, nigga down south\nSame ol' shit, bust in his mouth\nF-O-X call me rough sex\nEspecially when a bitch get right on the X\nGet it, right on X\nFuck him, check\nRight to the next\nBitches go right, Fox right to the left\nNigga can't fuck, burner his chest\n36 D's, Prada on the breasts\nBaddest, send him home, na na on his breath\nHow you think a bitch got my rep?\n3 Mills, still BK to the death\nStill don't give a fuck\nStill pose naked\nStill specialize in sittin' niggas faces\nPop magnum's by the cases\nX5, bitch, still spend big faces\nBig frown, brown, hold first places\nYou know what you can do nigga?\nYou can li li li lick me from my ass to my clit\nAnd ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka\n\n[Chorus: Ludacris, Shawna & Trina]\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave\n(Remix, remix)\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes\nAnd I wanna move from the bed down to the down to the to the floor\nI wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave (Remix, remix)\nBut you gotta let me kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy\nI wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your
