place\nI can let you know the ins and the outs\nAnd I can spit it wicked twisted\nAnd you can see by the look of my face\nGimme the mic and I\u2019ma mangle it tangle it\nDefinitely the people see that I got the hang of it\nPity you gotta try to make a mockery of a city who\nBlock 'em and block 'em, buck at you baby we dangerous\nCame to get strange with it, bang with it\nStop and get a little untame with it\nGet this chopper like I'm fully a bully with a hoodie\nShould he get up and take 'em out or spit 'caine with it?\nWell the answer is right before your eyes - who do you despise?\nKillers who chop you we got to stop you\nPop you partner, you gushin'\nGet up outta the way when Tecca Nina be bustin'\nGotta give it up, I\u2019m a veteran like Edison\nI\u2019ma light 'em up and get in your head again\nI\u2019m better than ever, never let up feather in, death he be fetishin'\nSever it, hit the mic and then we pedalin' medicine\nI\u2019m a chopper, chopper, chopper!\nAutomatic kickin' the ammunition\nKillin' the competition, no it ain\u2019t nobody\nHotter, hotter, hotter!\nDamagin' everything and everybody\nYou know we on a mission, listen to me\nHow can I make you understand I'm a general\nEven if you poppin' the competition is minimal\nKan-city killers and you can bet that we criminal\nThe demon inside of me keep on tellin' me when to go\nSo I\u2019ma keep reppin' the midwest choppers freakin' flows\nAnd I\u2019m 'bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin'\nBeggin' for mercy, you punk I ain\u2019t givin' you nothing (nothing)\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nWe can sang or we can bang\nIt ain\u2019t no game we untamed\nWhether it\u2019s fame or we can aim\nRelease your brains it ain\u2019t no thang\n(Midwest Choppers)\nYer'm sayin', we livin' in pain\nAnd it\u2019s a shame that you\nCame and got drained and listen\nMan, stay in your lane\n(Midwest Choppers)\nSang or we can bang\nIt ain\u2019t no game we

listen\nMan, stay in your lane\n(Midwest Choppers)\n\n[Verse 3: D-Loc]\nLyrically we be the best in the Midwest and we caked up\nI ain\u2019t talkin' about women, I\u2019m talkin' about paper\nD-Loc and Dalima enter the center\nAnd get coded and when in the competition we for sure to kill 'em\nI spit like a fully and ready made, through any type of weather\nWith the Beretta tucked right, under my sweater\nAnd we hotter than lava\nThe way that my gillas be keepin' it poppin'\nPartner you tight, but my gillas are better\nWe keep it choppin' like a blender, eatin' boys up for dinner\nGuillotines we chop your heads off, and throw 'em out the window\nWe too critical we ill and you walking away looking so pitiful\nThe AGT we be the number one contenders\n(When it come to the street we still post on the block)\n40 Cal. on my lap and my middle finger up to the cops\nOn the way to the studio to go and make another hot track\nThey be lovin' the way that we spit it when we drop\nThey call me D-Loc, so the functioning definition of a soldier\nMy opposition is more culture than Rocha\nI spit like a Tommy and anybody in my way I\u2019ma fold 'em\nAnd me and my gilla gorillas want it 'cause we the coldest boys\nBe tryin' to battle 'cause they want our position\nBut they can never get in it because we better and bigger\nAnd like I told you we the number one competitors dealin'\nWorkin' their way up to the top and they won't stop til they get the millions\nIn the hone of the century D-Loc and Dalima\nChemistry, you can never cross with them\nIgganas idah the ebe ossinbay the yricala\nIggertra eavela otherma uckerfay\u2019s lost\nYou can try to read us, you can try to beat us\nTry to get your speed up, but it ain\u2019t gon' matter\n'Cause after we get finished bustin' there ain\u2019t gon' be no laughter\nWe takin' over the map with Tecca Nina the master (master)\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nWe can sang or we can bang\nIt ain\u2019t no game we untamed\nWhether it\u2019s fame or we can aim\nRelease your brains it ain\u2019t no thang\n(Midwest Choppers)\nYer'm sayin', we livin' in pain\nAnd it\u2019s a shame that you\nCame and got drained and listen\nMan, stay in your lane\n(Midwest Choppers)\nSang or we can bang\nIt ain\u2019t no game we untamed\nWhether it\u2019s fame or we can aim\nRelease your brains it ain\u2019t no thang\n(Midwest Choppers)\nYer'm sayin', we livin' in pain\nAnd it\u2019s a shame that you\nCame and got drained and listen\nMan, stay in your lane\n(Midwest Choppers)\n\n[Verse 4: Dalima]\nWhen I\u2019m off in a zone, I get to representing the city of the K\nHollow your brain \u2018cause I\u2019m a disaster\nDalima get ridiculous if I\u2019m comin\u2019 at you\nLeave \u2018em in a predicament 'cause I\u2019m a style master\nAnd I\u2019m not impressionable, now just so you know\nI make 'em sweat, cause I\u2019m the best with the flow\nWhenever you wanna flex we can go, keep stressin\u2019 your cold\nAnd I bet I leave your neck on the floor\nMidwest finna blow like (C4 with a low strike)\n\u2018Cause the energy is the bomb\nI can tell that you\u2019re fascinated by the way that we rhyme\nAnd we glow like when the four strike with the fire\n(It ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 you can say though)\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m sipin\u2019 on Henny and bustin' like a semi on enemies now\nIrritated with the haters that be coming around\nSo I\u2019m kickin' like a relevant but an arrogant style\nMeaning that I\u2019m really sure so\nI\u2019m too sick for a cure, so\nAin\u2019t a need for a doctor\nMy verbal word play, be making your nerves shake cause I caught you\nPants down when I popped you\nNow let\u2019s take a trip through the valley of real gill\nStrange individuals with a militant ill skill\nPop a collar and holler at the broads with real skrill\nGet down for the cause, cause we flossin' big wheels, (what up with it?)\nDon\u2019t be acting like you get tough with it\nWhen the choppers come out the truck spitting\nAll of the Strange gill killas gon' be devoted to leavin' your body smokin' when really you can\u2019t get up with us\n(And that\u2019s game that\u2019s proper)\n\u2018Cause whenever I\u2019m bustin\u2019 it\u2019s like a full heart stopper\nDalima, Tecca Nina, Kaliko, and D-Loc\nRippin' \u2018em up with the flow 'cause we\u2019re Midwest Choppers!
