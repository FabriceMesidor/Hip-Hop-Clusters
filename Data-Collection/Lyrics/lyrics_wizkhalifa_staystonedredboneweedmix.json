I might invest\n\n[Chorus]\nI stay stoned, I stay stoned\nCause weed is legal (weed is legal)\nLet's get higher, up to the ceiling, ooh\nI stay stoned, I stay stoned\nCause weed is legal (weed is legal)\nBitch don't you blow my high, ohh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50f0115c51eb05d7025de13eb725b29c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
