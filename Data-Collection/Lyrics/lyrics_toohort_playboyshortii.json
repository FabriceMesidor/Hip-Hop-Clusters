the Oakland player\nBreakin\u2019 young freaks, baby, I don\u2019t care\nI was born to mack, I don\u2019t care what you think\nI\u2019m young and fresh and havin\u2019 bank\nToo $hort, baby, cold as hell\nDown to rap, and so for real\nI\u2019m never fake when I break \u2018cause I sho\u2019 can rap\nSucka MC\u2019s acknowledge that\nI\u2019ll be a star, you\u2019ll be my fan\nI\u2019ll treat you like my woman putting bank in my hands\nJust an everyday thang from the big O vet\nAll the players out here tell you that\u2019s no sweat\nRollin\u2019 two-tones, baby, day and night\nAnd I don\u2019t stop rappin\u2019 when I\u2019m on the mic\nAll the young girls scream, \u201cShort, don\u2019t stop\u201d\nGot 75 waitin\u2019 back in my drop\nMe and Chic pullin\u2019 freaks from near and far\nEven pulled a few freaks for my bodyguard\nEight deep in a limo, jammin\u2019 the beat\nRollin\u2019 on back to the O city\nOn a one-way trip, if you catch my drift\nStraight to the house for the homie\u2019s fix\nToo Short baby, on the go\nTo all you freaks, I know you know\nGet busy, or get lost\n\u2018Cause if you come with the crew, you\u2019re tossed\nSittin\u2019 back, she likes my body\nI kick on back while I watch her mount me\nI come fresh every time I speak\nRight at my show, see me pullin\u2019 a freak\nI\u2019m gettin\u2019 busy, forget the junk\nToo Short baby gotta get that funk\nLike a champ in the back, just opened the roof\nNo champagne, drink gin and juice\nThere\u2019s a freak show jumpin\u2019 on the old Bay Bridge\nToo Short baby all on that bitch\nI\u2019m a veteran, baby, in this game\nAnd Too Short baby that is my name\nI don\u2019t stop these raps when I\u2019m on the mic\nI spit it hard and fresh all day and night\nSo check it out baby \u2018cause it just won\u2019t stop\nToo Short baby\nShe\u2019s a fast mouth bitch, broke ass bitch\nWalking around town with a vicious itch\nI heard you started hookin\u2019 \u2013 where\u2019s your pimp?\nTryin\u2019 to get a hit and ain\u2019t got ten cents\nYou work all day, so you smoke all night\nYou know it\u2019s not right but that\u2019s your life\nYou just steal from your mother, breaking your broad\nYou think you\u2019re down but you really ain\u2019t hard\nFake mic singer, but you ain\u2019t that\nYou\u2019re a lowdown, no good dirty rat\nSo you smoke for a hit and then come right back\nYou wanna start smoking and only get smacked\nToo Short baby, I make G\u2019s\nI work leather suits when it\u2019s 90 degrees\nSee me sweatin\u2019 like a pig, but I\u2019m not trippin\u2019\nJumped in the Benz with the air condition\nTurn on the beat and wiggle my toes\nAnd rock that bitch like brand new Vogues\nMight saddle up, might ride it tough\nBut before I'm finished, I will get rough\nI\u2019m from the E the S the O, and yes\nFreak nasty, I am so fresh\nPeople might tell you I can\u2019t rap\nBut I roll Benz and my bank is fat\nSince I was born, I wanted to be a player\nNow I got young freaks everywhere\nI\u2019m the M-the A-the C-the K\nThe truest young player in the USA\nToo Short baby, you know I\u2019m hard\nYour girl tried to choose me and I dogged the broad\nKeep telling yourself couldn\u2019t be like that\nBut the bitch so sprung on a Too Short rap\nI could do what I want, just do what I please\nI walk through the door and she\u2019s down on her knees\nPlayers like me play it just like that\nMy game jumps off and I don\u2019t step back\nToo Short baby, on the mic\nAnd I tell ya like this, I\u2019ll tell you right\nI\u2019m the Playboy Short, big mack on the mic\nEvery day of my life fresh raps I write\nGonna chill on out where the players chill\nStudio piece in the Oakland Hills\nFrom New Year\u2019s Day to New Year\u2019s Eve\nYou\u2019ll find me here just rockin\u2019 the beat\nWith my pen in my hand and my headphones on\nAnd right next to me is the microphone\nSo when I grab that mic, I just get right up\nHit a few raps while I tear shit up\nLike Molly the mopper, the big big bopper\nI got her in the bed and I just couldn\u2019t stop her\nToo Short raps in your fuckin\u2019 face\nThe beat\u2019s real funky and you feel the bass\nYou see I made it, played it, and now it\u2019s out\nSo just kick on back while I tell you about\nThis freak I met, her name was Mary\nI took her to the house and I popped that cherry\nShe was so willing but she was so tight\nI had to work it and I worked it right\nBecause that\u2019s my nature, I don\u2019t quit\nWhen the funk hits me, you can\u2019t tell me shit\nI\u2019m a player, baby, call me Short\nI rock D.C. the way I rock New York\nYou see the Playboy S-H-O-R-T\nWill come just ready with a funky beat\nYou see I rock L.A. then I hit Detroit\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m the MC mack, the real McCoy\nI\u2019m not from New York \u2018cause I got my start\nComing straight from Oakland and I still rap hard\nSo before you say it, I\u2019m warning you, watch it\nWhenever I rap, homeboy, I rock it\nJust two hot, two fresh beats\nSir Too Short in about two weeks\nAnd in L.A., the jam is played\nWay past 2 by your favorite DJ\nTwo times, and then maybe two more\nEverybody wanna hear Sir Too Short\nSo just turn it up loud and I\u2019ll be coming through\nAnd you\u2019ll find out, baby, that it just takes two\nJust two hot, two fresh beats\nSir Too Short in about two weeks\nI\u2019m the Playboy Short, the ladies man\nDoing it twice for all my names\nFunk it up, funk it up and have no fear\nA young virgin told me wait two years\nBut I was outta that place in two seconds flat\nAll it took was two and I rock her back\nPunk bitch\n\n[Verse 2]\nI took homegirl to a drive-in movie\nJumped in the back and freaked her groupie\nHad it going on in the back of the hog\nHad the radio on and the windows fogged\nHave a girl saying, \u201cShort, give me some more\u201d\nIt only takes two, cool Sir Too Short\nJust one MC all by myself\nI said it only takes two and I don\u2019t need help\n\n[Verse 3]\nI went to a party \u2013 guess who was in it?\nTwo dumb suckas and in just two minutes\nThey were on the mic speaking my name\nSaying Too Short don\u2019t know the game\nBut when I got on the mic I said two rhymes\nAnd both of those suckas said \u201csorry\u201d two times\nI couldn\u2019t lie, I tried to be nice\nBut I just couldn\u2019t help it, I was laughing twice\nWith just two hot, two fresh beats\nSir Too Short in about two weeks\nAnd the jam is made by one named Too\nFresh as hell and it\u2019s just for you\nSo just take it, and don\u2019t give it back\n\u2018Cause it\u2019s worth a lot of money with Short on the track\nThat could only be true, and I have no doubt\nIt only takes two and I\u2019ll turn you out\nBITCH!", "image":
