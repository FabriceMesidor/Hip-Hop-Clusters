I went from popular to\u2026 in an instant\nMy friends forgot me cause they probably seen me on\u2026\nIn an\u2026 where I should be out at a party!\nIt drives me crazy, money is the due\nInsomnia I could wait.. something I can do to put the work in it\u2026\nFailure getting jealous, throwing dirt upon my name\nBurning up my pain, but I\u2019m working through my pain\nCause life\u2019s hard, \u2019till you learn it\u2019s just a game!\nPlay your cards, use your letters on your scrabble board\nIf you\u2019re small, put your heart into your rapping more\nNo money? why the fuck you\u2019re counting for?\nA thousand.. trying to get up my allowances\n\nWhat if I\u2019ll never make it?\nWhat if I\u2019m never famous?\nWhat if, I\u2019m broke\nAnd my whole life is been a joke?\nWhat if nothing never happens?\nWhat if I gotta stop rapping?\nWhat if, what if, what if this is it?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
