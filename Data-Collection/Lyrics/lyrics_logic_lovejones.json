What mistake did I make?\nSee shall we persevere forward with it or make a clean break\nSince the first day we met we both knew it was fate\nSo baby girl I guess you needed some time\nBut I put effort into you like I put effort in my rhymes\nNow that's on everything, my best friend I tell you anything\nGive you the world plus some kids pick out any ring\nSo know I'm down especially when we up\nHalf empty, half full\u2014fuck a cup, she my waterfall\nThis song is just for her fuck all of y'all\nAin't looking for no Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson\nI'm looking for the girl that always thought I was handsome\nBefore the money and some, chillin' and dirty dancing\nHigh price hotels flower pedals romancing now\nEvery now and then emotions they can shift\nBut all of this means nothing with no one to share it with\nI said every now and then emotions they can shift\nBut all of this means nothing with no one to share it with\n\n[Hook]\nIt's not about who wrong its not about who right\nIt's about the fact I think about you every single night\nIt's not about who wrong its not about who right\nIt's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight\nIt's not about who wrong its not about who right\nIt's about the fact I think about you every single night\nIt's not about who wrong its not about who right\nIt's about the fact it hurts when I ain't got you in my sight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f21a1e2589d732e4a263527296e9f51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
