Buyin' Jordans?\nBut we know their set, like a Euro step, them niggas nearly walkin'\nSo turn me up, I got it, turn me up, I got it\nThank God for this hip-hop cause on ESPN I bombed it\nYou can see that we keep our promise\nI could beat up, beat up, no conscience\nAnd ridin' with my feet up, my seat up, reclinin'\nSupreme up, my tee, and Moschino designer\nBelieve that your female'll follow\nBetter eat up or be up cause we at the Finals\nSwag champion, believe that, ring at the counter\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Verse 3: Fat Trel]\nI tried to let you pussy niggas eat\nMy chopper pussy kill and put you pussies in the street\nSay fuck the major cause I wasn't made for industry\nSB be the realest so picture them niggas killin' me\nLet's get it, I got them same dirty niggas with me\nSilencers give you life but they make a major difference\nYou play a witness, I heard you snitchin', you paid the hitter\nChanel purses and red bottoms, I'm bookin' tickets\nMy clip a 50, my money dirty, her pussy sticky\nYou give her hickeys, I fuck her, duck her and pass to Ricky\nMy palms itchy, I coulda swore I just hit the lotto\nSafe house in Cabo, my Spanish bitch related to Blanco\nMy blanket Morocco, my carpet is Cuban\nIt's never ordinary, don't confuse me with humans\n17 fire, what the fuck was you doin'?\nYour bricks were 30 apiece and 28 if you knew him\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Verse 4: Gunplay]\nLimpin' like a pimp, jumpin' out the gym\n6 Ring J's, every play's a win\nCountin' cash in the huddle, blocka, flash from the muzzle\nSpazz on a busta, beat your ass like a buzzer\nOh lord, here come the ball hogger\nThey call him Gunplay, they call him Don Logan\nHe a livin' legend, keep the engine revin'\nAnd the firearm, bring the fire alarm\nFuck Donald Sterling, fuck him, fuck Donald Sterling\nFuck him, fuck Donald Sterling, screamin' fuck Donald Sterling\nLoad the clips with my clippers, tippin' all the strippers\nThey bitin' on my belt buckle, grippin' on the zippers\nSnort a foul line, like it's child time\nMMG, 305, our time\nYayo, I'm like a hundred Hannibal Lectors\nReppin' that animal shelter\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Verse 5: French Montana]\nReportin' live from a white Wraith\nCourting hinds with the white base\nMy number one shooter got a white face\nTalkin' ladders with Atussin, we just fightin cases\nMontana, but tonight I'm Tony Parker\nHop out, hundred chains on Florence Parker\nChasin' dead faces on the blue paper\nFightin' fed cases, you need law paper\nMy money on another planet\nTalkin' fishscale, got the whole salmon\nHop out, sound like heavy metal\nMy money on another level\nYou fuckin' ordinary niggas\nWash head like Marbury, nigga\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Verse 6: Rockie Fresh]\nNigga gettin' bucks off of tellin' my story\nI come through in the clutch, I'm like Ray Allen at 40\nHit the shot and I splash, smoke a blunt, then I crash\nI got a bad college bitch who like to fuck after class\nShe study for finals, I study the game\nThese niggas don't know me but his bitch screamin' my name\nI be all over the union feelin' just like Dwyane\nSmokin' three pounds of the thunder, it go straight to the brain\nJust know the Bulls been the shit, wait 'til D Rose back\nNiggas ain't playin', they commentatin' like Shaq\nTwo mil' on the deal, pull my ring and I'm back\nAnd the whole team winnin', bitch look at the stacks\nOpen up, nigga, middle fingers up\nWe don't give a fuck, nigga\nStuntin' hard, I'm just tryna get a buck, nigga\nLike Milwaukee, walkie talkie, where you at, nigga?\nI'm gettin' stacks, nigga\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Verse 7: Tracy T]\nPop champagne like I won a championship game\nI keep that powder on me, nigga, like Lebron James\nThese niggas ordinary, Birdman, mercenary\nSlam dunk a tickin' bitch, I'm pitchin' out the Panamera\nKilled him in the paint, I swear to God I got a cemetery\nAin't nothin' but bad bitches to smash on my itinerary\n30 shot'll have 'em flippin' like a patty and my bitches lookin' like\nThey fresh out pageants, Aston Martin, ridin' rapid\nDrop top, choppers shootin' rampid, peel the leaf off of your cabbage\nI assist 'em with that package when I pass it, fosho\nI post up with it like Bosh, defense\nI got a duffle bag full of them blocks, offense\nLike Ray Allen with shots, cheerleaders, bitch\nGot a tour bus full of thots\nTeam full of heat, I'm talkin' Erik Spoelstra\nYeah bitch, Erik Spoelstra and a nigga post up\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nMy money on another level\nMy money on another level\nShe fuckin' ordinary niggas\nYour bitch be fuckin' ordinary niggas\n\n[Outro: Gunplay]\nFuck Donald Sterling, fuck him, fuck Donald Sterling, fuck him\nFuck Donald Sterling, screamin' fuck Donald Sterling\nScreamin' fuck Donald Sterling, fuck him, fuck Donald Sterling\n(Haaan) Fuck Donald Sterling, screamin' fuck Donald Sterling\nScreamin", "image":
