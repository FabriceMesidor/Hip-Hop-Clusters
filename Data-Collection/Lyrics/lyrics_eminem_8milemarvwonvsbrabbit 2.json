Y'all ready for death?\nMarv Won, the Fat Killer\nThe game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo\nI seen your type before, you think you're tough\nBattle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up\nIn a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back\nYou can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts\nIt's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds\nIt's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown\nDumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok\nCome in the club drunk as fuck\nSlap your bitch so we can buck\nOne hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf\nTryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys\nI'm quite nice on fight nights\nAnd why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life\nApparently not, I'm incoherently hot\nAnd if I miss you then your parents get shot\nYo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on\nI'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn\n\n[B-Rabbit]\nHold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on\nDon't think for a minute I'ma let you\nGet away with that song\n'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'\nAs a matter of fact, all of that shit was written\nAnd I know it wasn't for me\nSurely, you really must adore me\nNow, look it\u2026 yo, you might as well move  to Italy\nLook, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* \u2013 literally\nYou don't wanna really fuck with this\nOn this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus\nBut I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap\nAnd turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap\nAnd your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband\nFuckin' with this style, you're a dead man\nI ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up\nJust like your face when I had to rip it up\nYou don't wanna see me, yo, uh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b0796f6920cbb54e1b8f5f4622ed422.768x768x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
