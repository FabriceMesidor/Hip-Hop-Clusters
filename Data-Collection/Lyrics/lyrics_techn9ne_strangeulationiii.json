This type of fire don't extinguish\nNow write about some bigger shit, you striking out, swing and miss\nRing around the Rosie, homie, pocket full of pain\nKeep a lock up on my lane and triple optic in my brain, look\n\nRinging\nUbiquitous: \u201cYeah, what up?\"\nN9ne: \"Ubi?\"\nUbiquitous: \"What\u2019s going on man?\"\nN9ne: \"Hold on\u2026 Travis is calling me, hold up.\"\nN9ne: \"What up, Trav?\"\nTravis: \"What up man, I\u2019m outside right now.\"\nN9ne: \"Alright, here I come.\"\nTravis: \"Alright.\"\nN9ne: \"Peace.
