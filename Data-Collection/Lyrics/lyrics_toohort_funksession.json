gentlemen crowd around\nThe funk session is about to begin\nWhen I say funk session, i ain't talking about George Clinton\nI love that nigga though\nI ain't talking about James Brown and Sly Stone\nI'm not talking about mother fucking the Time and Prince\n(What you talking about?)\nWe talking about funk session 96 style\n96 funk mean a different thing\nThat means you looked at my woman, and I'm stepping to you\nAnd you about to pull out the gat and try to blow a nigga's brains out\n\nToo Short:\n\nYou see we can't along cause we just don't want to\nYou cross the game and my crew will just stomp you\nAnd sing the ripper, we just say oh well\nAnd the white man keeps on building more jails\nI know the system ain't nothing to fool with\nCause you locked up all my homies that I went to school with\nAnd I know damn well you got my name on the list\nCause I'm the one that called your daughter a bitch\nJust a black man doin good, you wanna do me\nBefore you ban rap you need to ban them violent movies\nGangsta rap causes crime, Mike Tyson wrecked the system\nLarry Hoover ran a gang in Illinios can't forget\nMalcom X taught us knowledge, Martin Luther preached for peace\nAnd every day black men lying dead in the street\nSo where's the real education, in the hood\nPeace to the muslims cause they're doing real good\nThey're never giving up, on the black folks\nWe need to buy our own land and try to stack dough\nGet rich if you want to, I ain't trying to front you\nIf Robert Gold want some funk tell him come through\nIt's been a long night but we're still getting funky\nWho opened up the cage and let out the monkey\nI heard it when she said it, \"You just a dogg Short\nLike them G's out in South Side Chicago\"\nI said that's right ho, I'm from the East O\nAnd I will never spend my money on a six-fo\nHigh performance, is what I'm riding\nI got the game from Oakland so I never stop siding\nI'm getting money in this criminal's country\nHo's show me love because my pimping's so lovely\nI'm not a role model, unless you trying to mack her\nCause first I am player and second I'm a rapper\nThird I'm just a big ass baller\nTop notch on my beeper but I still won't call her\nCause I got one with me, And I'm a pimp till I die\nDon't be talking to them snitches, you'll get sent on a lie\nDoing time in the pen for some backstabbing\nI wonder what would happen if they catch em\nYou burn his balls with a big lighter, get the gasoline\nAnd he'll be smoking like a mother fucking dope fiend\nNowaday's they like to kill your whole crew\nFor coming to the party and stepping on a shoe\nHe said excuse me, but it wasn't al-right\nSo now you want to take his punk ass outside\nSo you can hit him, and with him\nLet his momma bury him in a suit that don't fit 'em\nYou don't give an F-U-C-K\nSo just fuck him\nDidn't have to shoot him, just walked out and stuck him\nKnife up and down all around in his gut\nStanding in his blood looked down and said \"What's up?\"\n\nWhat's up nigga, Shock G tell 'em like Treach\n\nShock G:\n\nEast coast niggers are the craziest\nAnd West coast niggers are the craziest\nAnd down south niggers are the craziest\nIt seems like all american niggers are the craziest\n\nIt done got out of hand\nWe don't drink that potion at the white mother fucking masses\nImmediate and cooked up for us and now we killing each other\nRemember me all, I want everybody to look back\nYo this is Shock G from Digital Underground\nI want you to look back right now\nWe rolling with the Dangerous Crew\nI want you to look back when I said\nY'all remember that shit when I said, I said ah\nAmerica, Get busy Humpty yeah\nThe red the white the blue and the blue and red for crips and bloods\nThe white for whose got you doing time\nWe busting caps on one another and it never stops\nYou know it never stops\nBut you know, that Shock's been searching for someone\nWho can rise like Malcom and Farahkan\nTo straighten you niggers out\n\nShit they call me MC Blowfish\nBack when Digital Underground first started\nSay, I was running the whole thing, say\nThe call me MC Blowfish hey\nYeah, and I kick a little thing like this\nI say, I say, I say, I say\nShorty check me out\nI say, I say\n\nNow follow as I slip into that butter melody\nThis is the part Shock takes your heart and leaves you vision blurry\nSo try to focus on my dope\nI suggest that you invest in a telescope\nAs I come with hella rythem\nMove closer to your television\nGet your look just like that hooker catch Jay ism\nEven with my vocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though\nAs I flavor rub this vidy like oregano\nI'm slanging them nouns and verbs\nYou couldn't see me with binoculars\nI guess I'm just a little different cause I do love them hoes\nJust maybe not the same way I love my niggeros\nCause I love it when they say something fly\nThe ill caps make me laugh till I cry\nSome frys and some freaks and it's on\nAll night long\nI love to see my homies living strong\nBut then that cook with that cloudy cookbook\nRains salts on another brother's sunny day\nI'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play\n\nI said I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely G game we play\nCause it's hella fun here, I'm not going to front on that\nYeah, niggers have booming fun\nFlossing and fucking with these hoes and capping niggers\nBut wheres we heading as a people\nWhere is we heading\nThis is the funk session y'all\nCheck me out\nThis is Shock G from D-Flow production Squad\nCooling right now with the Dangerous Crew\nYeah I got my man Breed in the house\nBreed bought to roll a fatty while my man Shorty B get on the 6 string\nAnd blow your mind, Yeah\nI got Pee-Wee in the house\nAnd you know what Pee-Wee said\nHe said, He said Shock, You know that...(fade out)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0beecdd3eab679b0da499a4789a13373.599x594x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
