Money, got to make it all back\nThey say I'm nice and charming, but I got them mean racks\nThese niggas say they balling, but they never seen racks\nOpen the heart, man, I think I need a mean 'lac\nIt's Guwop, I took the game and I ain't giving it back\nI fell off, but I bet you I ain't falling back\nI get your whole clique wacked for like ten stacks\nIt's Brick Squad 1017 and I mean that\nGot Dirty Money just like Diddy. Had to clean that!\n\nI fell off, but I bet you I ain't falling back\nI get your whole clique wacked for like ten stacks\nIt's Brick Squad 1017 and I mean that\nGot Dirty Money just like Diddy.
