To me it\u2019s so romantic\nThey used to laugh when I had three jobs at 18\nAct like I was crazy; only focus was making green\nNow I can hold our whole class reunion at my house\nLaugh now.  Word to Ross.  Feel like the biggest boss\n\n[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]\nWatch us ball\nStop a star, nigga not at all\nI'm poppin' broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin' mall\nAll money in the squad, boy I'm not involved\nCan't pay the cost to floss? I can spot your flaws\nSLs with the toppin' off\nDress well when it's time to ball\nCouple hundred for my boxer drawers\nYoung nigga used to shop at Ross\nFirst to shoot when it's poppin' off\nCouple times, a nigga almost got popped by Ross\nCrash unit, buzz cut, ex-marines\nCrenshaw, Slauson Ave 17\nInfant Stone, Lil' Shady, Baby Buke to fast light a demonstration\n85 Cutlass with the 380s\nSummertime functions, L.A. streets' crazy\nShoot it out' that's what this crew about\nHangin' out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out\nProve yourself, killers in pursuit of clout\nIt felt wrong, but who is you to doubt\nLook, my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south\nAnd hopefully one day I'll put this music out\nTrippin' now, seeing that it's moving out\nI'm buying spots, nigga moving out\nMy fan base, I see 'em moving south\nI'm overseas eating fucking cro\u00fbte\nYeah. So I can tell you what this hustling 'bout\nI couldn't tell you what no luck about\nI had maps on my wall, nigga\nDope sacks in my drawers, nigga\nLook, a lot of stress I couldn't rest not at all\nNigga risking everything trynna ball", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3dce21029cdd8aab73eb473e015807d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
