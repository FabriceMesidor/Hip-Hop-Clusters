could never be a slave, niggas\nThey gon' have to pay me, Navy\nDownloaded by the tidals like Jay-Z\nThat's a roll offshore like an A.P., Davy\nJones' locker on top of those hoppers off the side of the ship\nSuicide, didn't die from the dip\nSubmarine man, keep your eyes on the blips\nSonar, echolocation, know where we are facin'\nGet back to our nation, oh Lord\nSo we walkin' back to Africa\nAnd I found a detour to the seashore\nYes, jumped off the deck\nTo leave footsteps on the depths of the sea floor, ayy\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\nWow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo

the tide\nSea salty 'cause it cry with us when we looked it in the eyes\nLike how could you help her?\nPoseidon apologized and said that I'm sorry, we're shelter\nY'all can live down here forever, drownin' is severed\nFrom all your lungs and the lungs of your sons\nTell your daughters the water's a treasure\nSummon the forest\nTalkin' to trees, now how could you be in the chorus\nWith something so horrid?\nYou became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships\nAnthropomorphic, the forest returned with a match\nMade from itself and said, \"Burn us with that\"\nThen left again and came back with an axe\nWe can serve you as furniture or furnace us black, ayy\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\nWow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\nWalkin' on water, wow, wow\nWalkin' on water, wow, wow\nWalkin' on water, ayy\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, shipwreck with us\nGrab vessels, bring 'em down to the depths with us\nTake ahold of the bow

us\nConversations with the constellations\nWhile you navigate the haters, black baby alligator baiters\nSupposed to do greater, with all of your alphas and betas\nAnd minors and majors\nYou were so busy just tryin' to shine\nYou shoulda been tryin' to save us\nStar said, \"Excuse our behavior\nWe will be indebted to you for all of eternity\nIf you counseled your heart and forgave us\nRemove all our favors from childrens of sailors and slavers\nRepay you with acres\nBut here in the heavens where harvest is greater\nA meager inheritance, pardon our arrogance\nThose with Americans, guide them to places much safer, ayy\"\n\n[Chorus]\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\nWow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\nWow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\nWalkin' on water, wow, wow\nWalkin' on water, wow, wow\nWalkin' on water, ayy\n\n[Outro]\nSeas, all that I have for you, forest\nFire and maps for you, stars\nFall off the flag for you, sugar\nSweeten the path for you, seas\nAll that I have for you, forest\nFire and maps for you, stars\nFall off the flag for you, sugar\nSweeten the path for you, seas\nAll that I have for you, forest\nAre fire and maps for you, stars\nFall off the flat for you, sugar\nSweeten the path for you, seas\nAll that I have for you, forest\nAre fire and maps for you, stars\nFall off the flag for you, sugar\nSweeten the path for you", "image":
