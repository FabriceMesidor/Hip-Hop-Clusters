I went to jail and\nThey made me number one..\nI appreciate them stickin' up\nFor me when everyone was kickin\nMe when I was down... That's love and\nI'll never trade that..so for the Bay\nAnd Philly and all those areas and all those\nGhettos and towns..I love y'all..\nDon't let this east coast west coast thing get to you...\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nSometimes I try to do good but I just can't be\nIt's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me\nAnd y'all should thank me\nBut my haters busy trying to send me home early\nBut you can't New Orlean Saint me\nI ain't a saint B, I ain't a god God\nI ain't a angel neither but I try hard y'all\nI'm lighting up for all my soldiers at war\nAs I sit back and watch\nThe ashes on my cigar fall\nThey say death comes in threes\nWho's next in line?\nAnd I just lost a best friend for the second time\nNow I'm on a quest to find peace\nStill gotta carry my piece and\n\"Soo Woo!\" when it's reppin' time\nY'all don't understand.. I'm misunderstood\nGive Interscope two more albums\nThen I'm done for good\nSold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood\nIt's a cold world, everybody need a hood\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears\n\n[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nAfter realizing, to master enterprising\nI ain't have to be in school by ten, I then\nBegan to encounter with my counterparts\nOn how to burn the block apart, break it down into sections\nDrugs by the selections\nSome use pipes, others use injections\nSyringe sold separately Frank the Deputy\nQuick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing\nTo protect my position, my corner, my lair\nWhile we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer\nIf the game shakes me or breaks me\nI hope it makes me a better man\nTake a better stand\nPut money in my mom's hand\nGet my daughter this college grant so she don't need no man\nStay far from timid\nOnly make moves when your heart's in it\nAnd live the phrase sky's the limit\nMotherfuckers\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/1459c1f7d4945ab4cc2933081be7cd84.600x413x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
