Oh dat long\n\nHow the hell he get time like that?\nThree strikes with possession, aww he ain't comin back\nHe left you with 2 kids and bills all around\nPlus you found out he had another chick cross-town\n\nIt's always the darkness right before the sun rises\nAnd you gotta stay strong for the kids in their eyes and\nPlease don't despise and go against all brothers and\nHave a hatred in your heart and take it out on another\n\nI hate to sound Tupacish now momma but keep your head up\nBut you gon' make it I promise you keep your head up\nAnd that, that don't kill you only makes you stronger\nAnd the will to succeed will only feed the hunger, Fo' Reel (Fo' Reel, Fo' Reel)\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohh ohh ohh\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohhoh ohh\n\nI was at the gas station and a man walked past\nWith his sign will work for food, clothes or cash\nAnd he asked if he could pump my gas, so I let him\nClean the windshield and throw out the trash, so I let him (Hey)\n\nI even asked a brother his name, where he was from, got kids man and what's their ages\nHe kinda stuttered for a second\nHe kinda looked surprised that anyone would even take an interest in his life\nHe said young brother dem the only words I done heard in the last year that wasn't no or get the fuck away from herrre\nHow could somthin so simple as general conversation\nMean much more than general conversation? (Hey)\nYou could tell life had beaten him down\nLike he was in the title fight and this might be his last round\nSometimes the easiest things we take for granted\nUntil they gone, then realise we even had it, Fo' Reel (Fo' Reel, Fo' Reel)\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohh ohh ohh\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohh ohh ohh\n\nI used to think that life had a plan for me\nUntil I realised life had to be planned by me, see that's the key\nI only deal with what I can see cause over history, mystery brought us nothin but misery\nMan more people done died in the name of the lord\nThan in any natural disaster, disease or gangwars\nBefore guns there was swords and they was killin each other\nAnd what's changed to this day still killin each other\nKillin a brother while another mother cries for help\nMan! we need to help a brother find themself\nFeed em light 1, 2, 3\nHey! that's something every brother should see and that's Fo' Reel\nAnd that's Fo' Reel, and that's Fo' Reel\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohh ohh ohh\nHa ha ha ha ha ohh\nAnd dey say ohh ohh ohh [Repeat: x 3]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8acc2c921ff6defb4a5463597263ff0e.750x750x1.png"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
