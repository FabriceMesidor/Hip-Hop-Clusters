SEAN!)\n(BIG! SEAN!)\n(BIG! SEAN!)\n(BIG! SEAN!)\n(BIG! SEAN!)\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nJust to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches\nThanking God Almighty, condoms were invented\nCause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons\nMan. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)\nBut under these conditions, she was with it\nThen I hopped up on that red eye when I finished\nI been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning\nFucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it\nGetting rest that I be missing\nBut fuck it I'm on a mission\nFlight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate\nNow it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot\nI know the Program Director hot\nBut I spit a freestyle up in there so cold\nThat everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check\nAnd I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station\nAnd that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme\nManager said we ain't got time, but time to time\nYou gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around\nI say \"Aye dawg, What you got?\", \"Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot\nUm, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid\nTryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid\nUm, I'm like a young black Eminem\nIt's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan\nTryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them\nAnd a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it\nI mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I\nSo I give him my email on a fly\nAnd if his song's good I'll reply\n\n[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]\nTrick Trick: Hello\nShorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga\nTrick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?\nShorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg\nTrick: What!\nShorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye\nTrick: Oh hell naw, what?\nShorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man\nTrick: Awwww Dang! Tight!\nShorty: Bet, He short as hell though\nBoth: Hahahaha\nShorty: But that nigga was cool though man\nTrick: Alright!\nShorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars\n\n[Outro 1: Big Sean]\nTell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith\nIn something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe\nWhat you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch\nWhat you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe\nBut when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E\nAll the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need\nAll the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need\nI'm sorry\n\n[Outro 2: Mama Myra]\nI know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/27fece6af1c9ca0717550d393fff7409.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
