You neglected me\nDid me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set\nBut a special place for you in my heart I have kept\nIt's unfortunate, but it's\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n(Can't take no more)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh\n\u2018Cause that ain't good enough\nYou expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap\nDon't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap\nHow can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that\nDon't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?\nJealous when I spend time with the girls\nWhy I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know\nBut tonight I'm serving you with papers\nI'm divorcing you \u2013 go marry someone else and make 'em famous!\nAnd take away their freedom like you did to me\nTreat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you\nFeed 'em the same shit that you made me eat\nI'm moving on, forget you\nOh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you\nAll I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch\nChew me up and spit me out, I fell for this\nSo many times it's ridiculous\nAnd still I stick with this, I'm sick of this\nBut in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get\nEvil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em\nMy friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from\nI'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama\nI'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a\nMess, cursed and blessed, but this time I\nAin't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss\nYou're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed\nBut when you spoke of people\nWho meant the most to you, you left me off your list\nFuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you\nMy life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just...\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n(I'm gone, man)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\nToo late\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8267d6f45cdffed8db78f53fa00991c5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
