I ain't got no beef\nSee all that bitchin'? It taste like chicken\nAnd all these chickens? They get plucked\nAnd nobody wants to see the volcano erupt\nI'm down with Daz 'cause everythang is Kurupt\nI'm celebrated every time I pull up\nYou hella hated, every time you look up\nI'm elevated to rapper's deluxe\nThey love me, dawg, 'cause I'm one of a kind\nThis is God's plan, homie, it ain't mine\nSee, this ain't about dyin', it's all about shinin'\nIt's all about climbin' a hill full of diamonds\nI know that you feel it, I know that you felt it\n'Cause a nigga gon' live 'til a nigga can't help it\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\n(They love me, dawg)\nWhen my story is over and my song is done\n(They love me, dawg)\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\nThe end\n\n[Verse 2]\nSorry, y'all, I ain't got no haters\nAll I got is mother fuckers tellin' me I'm the greatest\nAll I got is those fly ass suits and gators\nNobody servin' Cube but maids and waiters\nNobody tryin' to take my life\nAll these bitches tryna do is replace my wife\nBut you hoes ain't cold enough to fuck with Ice\nLike Kim she'll run circles 'round you bitches twice\nNow, it might get funky but it won't get ugly\nNiggas might not like me but they still love me\nNiggas might talk shit, they whisper and huddle\n'Cause they know my rebuttal might leave a puddle\nNow the streets is talkin' until they see me walkin' up the block, then all the bullshit stop\nAnything I do, don't take it personal 'cause when a nigga gone, that shit ain't reversible\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\n(They love me, dawg)\nWhen my story is over and my song is done\n(They love me, dawg)\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\nThe end\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm the bastard that spit the acid\nFuck a funeral home and a casket\nFuck a funeral song and a procession\nKeep God on your dome and count your blessings\nKeep the hood in your heart but Heaven on your mind\nShake 'em up and roll seven every time\nPick 'em up, yup, stick 'em up\nEvery time you see me got a different color cup\nThis ain't about dyin', it's all about livin'\nIt's all about makin' everyday Thanksgivin'\nIt's all about givin', about stayin' driven\nIt ain't about you, it's about these children\nSo when a nigga die, stop cryin' and ventin'\nWill somebody in here bump George Clinton?\nWill somebody in here hug my fam?\nDon't worry about me, you know where I am\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the cold wind blows in the heart of the city and I'm gone\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\n(They love me, dawg)\nWhen my story is over and my song is done\n(They love me, dawg)\nI know the streets will shed tears for me\nThe end", "image": "https://images.genius.com/90eb800a406018bdc1a360ae9db5d64d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
