NO!\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI didn't do it, got something to stir it up\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nMigraine, I'm bane, ain't nobody feelin' my pain\nStupid women I blame so goodbye sane I'ma fry my brain! Drugs I'ma try aim to deny shame and defy thy rain\nLook into my eye mane I wanna fly gettin' really high and die strange\nHow do I describe, you and I entropy, inside of me an entity\nTurning me into to the portion of identity\nThat you'll never know there, 'til my anger make a slow tear\nAny beef wanna grow, I swear I eat it so rare, baby oh yeah\nTake off your bitchiness that hate oh so it's just\nTurning me into the insane, playing all kind of sin games\nTaking it in like a ganja hit, you're the reason why the bomb was lit\nGot me thinking \"murder everything in sight\", monster shit!\n\n[Hook: Jonathan Davis]\nDo you really wanna see this thing that's turning in me?\nTurning in me? NO!\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI didn't do it, got something to stir it up\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI didn't do it, got something to stir it up\nI am, I am, I am liberating me, starting to turn\nI couldn't see it but hatred is feeding it\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne & Jonathan Davis]\nNo!\nWait for it, wait for it!\nDriving me crazy when you lie to me baby\nYou're driving me crazy when you lie to me baby\nDriving me crazy when you lie to me baby\nWell that's real shady, you might die if you play me!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dac1cf83fc6c83ed086fa8adde3a8bc2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
