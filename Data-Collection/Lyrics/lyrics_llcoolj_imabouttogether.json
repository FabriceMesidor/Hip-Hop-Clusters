Kelly)\nWoo, and you say New York City, ah uh\nBack by popular demand (ah yayaya yaya yaya)\nYou been waitin' in the baby for so long baby\nWe had 'em starvin', ay yo E, the big homey\n\n[LL Cool J]\nStar studded, my ear lobes is flooded\nDJ's wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it\nEasy does it, ladies love it, cats with big budgets\nBB Jay, two jets and Tar Smith luggage\nClowns talkin' rubbish and pretending they thuggish\nBut I'm a young living legend like Pee Wee at the ruckus\nI was raised out of Queens but rap kept me off it\nCover of Feds Magazine, put me in the Gulf stream\nYa man done it, push the E-X one hundred\nAnd you don't want it, I got the whole rap game cornered\nWatch me flaunt it, damn right I'm iconic\nSoon as next find a icey track, I slide on it\n\n[R. Kelly]\nI know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me\nI'm about to get her\nAnd I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me\nI'm about to get her\nSee I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me\nI'm about to get her\nI know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me\nI'm about to get her\n\n[LL Cool J]\nThe beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake\nThe safe in the floor with a lifetime of cake\nWifey email and make my side vibrate\nCats still can't believe I'm hot, I got 'em irate\nThe hip-hop boss of the empire state\nCats never front on me, they know I drive weight\nIt's the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J\nBeen platinum so long, my skin's turning grey\nOk, they don't know how to act\nAnd my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back\nMinimum, private jets in the millennium\nPlenty of Benjamins, hot ladies and gentlemen\n\n[R. Kelly]\nI know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me\nI'm about to get her\nAnd I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me\nI'm about to get her\nSee I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me\nI'm about to get her\nI know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me\nI'm about to get her\n\n[R. Kelly]\nGirls, they girls, they girls, so sexy\nGirls, they girls, they got much body\nGirls, they girls, they showin' bellies\nYou're the girl in my fantasy\n\n[R. Kelly]\nGirls, they girls, they girls, so sexy\nGirls, they girls, they got much body\nGirls, they girls, they showin' bellies\nYou're the girl in my fantasy\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI know that it's ridiculous for y'all to picture this\nThe way I keep rein' up, servin' and flippin' this\nDot the I's, cross the T's, meticulous\nThe coldest Winter ever and I'm so icicle-ish\nThe movement is flavor, full bags of licorice\nThe drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace\nThere's no forgettin' this, the way I'm reppin' this\nMy bodyguard's big but do that make me rebellish\nI'm in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson\nThat's why I'm still a teen pop idol like Hanson\nYoung, black and handsome, movin' with the cheddar\nBring honey to the V.I.P., I'm about to get her, let's go\n\n[R. Kelly]\nI know there's gotta be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me\nI'm about to get her\nAnd I know there's gotta be some kinda chick up off in here that's got the hots for me\nI'm about to get her\nSee I know there's gotta be one sexy little freak that wanna leave with me\nI'm about to get her\nI know it's gotta be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me\nI'm about to get her\n\n[R.
