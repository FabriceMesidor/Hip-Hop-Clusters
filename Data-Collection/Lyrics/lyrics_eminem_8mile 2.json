Why do I still write?\nSometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life\nSometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics\nAnd show these people what my level of skill's like\nBut I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life\nSomethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights\nCase of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like\nDa-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault\nGreat big eyeballs, my insides crawl\nAnd I clam up, I just slam shut\nI just can't do it, my whole manhood's\nJust been stripped, I have just been vicked\nSo I must then get off the bus, then split\nMan, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home\nWorld on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a man, I'ma make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nTime for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back\nThe spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap\nTo the same plant, in the same pants\nTryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP\nAnd get a new plan, Momma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors her big brother and mother and dad\nAin't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset, \u2018cause I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best\nAnd I try, sit alone and I cry\nYo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God\nPlease don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job\nYo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are\nYo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own, I'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nTime for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it\nOr see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is\nTo be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits\nIt's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate\nOf authenticity, you'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me, it's my credibility\nYou never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC\nWho's incredible upon the same pedestal as me\nBut yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve MCs in the lunchline\nBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?\nWho must I show to bust my flow?\nWhere must I go? Who must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket?\n\u2018Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit\nI'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold, tryna travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode\nMy defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one, this city is no fun\nThere is no sun, and it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got\nBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn\nYo, it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl\nI can no longer play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient, all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat, all I need is the words\nGot the urge, suddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occurred\nTime to show these Free World leaders the three and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan (It's alright, it's okay)\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nTime for me to just take matters into my own hands (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back (I'ma make it somehow)\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin' (It's alright, it's okay)\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone (I'm gonna make it anyway)\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own (Gonna make it, can't give up now)\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road (I'ma make it somehow)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e4a1bd93e045b909843de21d49a9bb97.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
