{"songs": [{"title": "Writer At War: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s XXL Cover Story", "album": null, "year": "2015-01-06", "lyrics": "Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, \u201cHow does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?\u201d Nobody ever really asks about what it\u2019s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can\u2019t make a song like \u201ci\u201d without being in that dark place. \u201ci\u201d comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, \u201cKendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.\u201d Or \u201cI was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.\u201d\n\nI believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn\u2019t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it\u2019s a whole different story to me. That\u2019s when I learned that while I\u2019m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that\u2019s spooky\n\nI think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term \u201crole model.\u201d You would say, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be a role model. I don\u2019t want none of that.\u201d But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It\u2019s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don\u2019t get a response like, \u201cKendrick, will you sign this real quick?\u201d Or, \u201cI wanna just take this picture with you.\u201d No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something\n[Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that\u2019s the only thing that kind\u2019ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I\u2019m meeting these different people every day. It kind\u2019ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain\u2019t that important when you meeting somebody that\u2019s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, \u201cKendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.\u201d And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it\u2019s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it\nAnything I say or do, I don\u2019t take back, I don\u2019t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word \u201cfamous.\u201d I\u2019m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it\u2019s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others\n\nI had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, \u201cTry to completely throw away your ego.\u201d How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places\u2014the big spots, all the events, the lights\u2014it\u2019s all for your ego. It\u2019s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I\u2019m somebody. But truthfully, you\u2019ve always been somebody. You don\u2019t need the lights\n\n\n\n\nI try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what\u2019s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I\u2019m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can\u2019t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it\u2019s not just me you\u2019re focusing on now when I\u2019m out in public, but also on individual characters that I\u2019m talking about in my music. So that\u2019s a whole other ballgame and it\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve gotta accept\nWhen I\u2019m completely drained of inspiration, that\u2019s when I\u2019m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it\u2019s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom\u2019s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I\u2019d never think that would happen, but it\u2019s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can\u2019t drive that thing no more. And she\u2019s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the day-to-day. It\u2019s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it\u2019s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it\n\nI\u2019d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, \u201cThis is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I\u2019m finna put it to you in a whole album\u2014from Compton, from the hood, from the streets\u2014it\u2019s a whole other perspective and light, I\u2019ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and \u2019Pac did it. And I\u2019ma tell my story.\u201d Then I wrapped up with it and said, \u201cMan, what\u2019s on the radio right now? I don\u2019t think they doin\u2019 skits and things like that.\u201d I don\u2019t know if the people are gonna understand what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about on this album because it\u2019s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain\u2019t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least\n\n\n\n\nMy whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don\u2019t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn\u2019t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, \u201cMan, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don\u2019t know. Y\u2019all sure I\u2019m right?\u201d\n\nI was nervous because I didn\u2019t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it\u2019s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, \u201cNever feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.\u201d This is his words verbatim, he said, \u201cWatch what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d\nI believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I\u2019ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn\u2019t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family\n\nBecause that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that\u2019s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I\u2019m looking around like, this is great security, but I don\u2019t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that\u2019s in need. But at the same time, I\u2019m feeling like, okay, what\u2019s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d And them being able to recite them lyrics\nKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played \u201cBitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I\u2019m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, \u201cPlay some stuff .\u201d I can\u2019t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I\u2019m gonna be influenced and I don\u2019t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it\u2019s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It\u2019s selfishness for sure, but it\u2019s my selfishness and I own it\n\nI know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don\u2019t take back, I don\u2019t regret. That\u2019s how I was feeling at the time and that\u2019s how y\u2019all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that\u2019s how I look at it\n\nFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper\u2019s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin\u2019 barbarian. That\u2019s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper \u2019cause this is around the same time where cats weren\u2019t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn\u2019t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that\u2019s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer\u2019s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that\u2019s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It\u2019s the art of writing\nSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, \u2018Who am I? Is this really what I\u2019m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What\u2019s my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I\u2019m obsessed with it. And that\u2019s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I\u2019m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That\u2019s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that\u2019s something that I hold dear\n\nWhen I\u2019m completely drained of inspiration, that\u2019s when I\u2019m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn\u2019t tamper with, I\u2019ve already had done, that\u2019s when I\u2019m done and I know I\u2019ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I\u2019m drawn away from it, that\u2019s when I say, okay, let\u2019s take all these pieces\u2014they might not even be songs\u2014let\u2019s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the best part because the things that I say on my records\u2014this is another reason why I don\u2019t just play records for people\u2014you won\u2019t necessarily get it until it\u2019s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I\u2019m not an artist that\u2019s gonna give you a single and say, \u201cThis is what my album\u2019s gonna sound like, go sell it.\u201d That\u2019s not me. I\u2019m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that\u2019s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don\u2019t want to jump in somebody else\u2019s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I\u2019m inspired\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there\u2019s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don\u2019t necessarily scare me. It\u2019s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: \u201cDr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.\u201d\n\nThank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back\n[Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn\u2019t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn\u2019t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you\u2019re saying, \u201crap,\u201d that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep\n\nI found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It\u2019s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I\u2019m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that\nWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, \u201cWho am I? Is this really what I\u2019m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What\u2019s my responsibility?\u201d It\u2019s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it\u2019s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don\u2019t necessarily change, it\u2019s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don\u2019t care about them or you don\u2019t fuck with them no more when that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019re just more focused on what you have to do because it\u2019s bigger\n\nThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that\u2019s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there\u2019s tension in the air that I probably can\u2019t necessarily deal with at the moment. \u2019Cause when the industry don\u2019t understand me, and the business don\u2019t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can\u2019t run to them?\n\nArtists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I\u2019m always paranoid. I\u2019m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you\u2019re put into a space where you feel like you can\u2019t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day\n\nThe hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It\u2019s almost like you go on the road and you\u2019re gone for two years. And this place you\u2019ve known your whole life, these people you\u2019ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that\u2019s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don\u2019t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being\n\nWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I\u2019ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I\u2019m saying this right now to let everyone know, it\u2019s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/bd22f08574046822ccea9cab412ec7e0.670x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
