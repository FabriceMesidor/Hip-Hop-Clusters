Can you fix me up?\nCan you wipe me down\nSo I can make you give it up, give it up\nMake you say my name like a Jersey, Jersey\nShuttin' down the game\nBe my head coach so you can\nAnd never take me down 'til you can taste the win\nDo it again and again till you say my name\nAnd by the way I'm so glad\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat\nCan you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class\nSo I can give it to you rough like a first draft\nHold you like a paper plane, you know I got paper, babe\nThem dollar bills, girl, make it rain\nHoliday Inn, come and meet me on my eighth floor\nDamn it feels good but I feel bad for the next door\nAnd I, and I, I, I apologize\nBut when I slip, slip like two girls into slip n' slide\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat, sweat\nWhere you goin'? Whatcha say?\nI'm why her river flowin' to another lake\nBy to ocean, by the ocean, on the beach, on the beach\nLet me dip my feet in and make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat\nI wanna make you sweat, sweat\nI just wanna make you sweat", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c99dd335733f9c3cf16f57c9f589cfb.361x361x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
