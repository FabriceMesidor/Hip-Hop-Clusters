It's just a little bit of show money\nBut if you want me to get it wet another ways\nThen I'ma have to beat it up but first I'ma play with you girl\nTouch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls\nThen I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl?\nWhen I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin or fakin\nOn me baby cause I know it takes the right touch\nI ain't stoppin til you wet up the covers\nBecause I gotta keep on fuckin til I see a lot of white stuff\nNow you got me excited I can't hold it\nI'm feelin it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion\nLet it ride when I see you animatin and shakin\nWhen I touch your body you catchin convulsions\nThats when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to\nYou chose me. I chose you\nDon't think I can get it wet? I told you\nCome and let the Twist rain down on you\n\nChorus (x2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f832da8d956be1aa5e9a0ec763dcd481.716x716x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
