To get some petroleum\nRodeo circus, these trashy motha fuckers\nTrying to show me they tat's on purpose\nSwastika's here, Swastika's there, minding my affairs\n'Til one shoved me and I said, \"aw this is lovely\"\nI punched him back and said take that from a black\nHis posse ran up I threw my hand up, said let loose the gats\nThey said, \"We're the type of boys that kill 'coons by the hour\nNigger one God, one race, sieg heil, white power!\"\nI said \"Fuck you. Bill Riccio, you spacey ho'\nI heard racist were dying and I'm about to increase the ratio\"\nWhile we were scrappin' I heard, \"coon, monkey, ape, baboon\"\nI heard my partner's lettin' loose they cleared the room\nI let off a couple inside their racist encephalus\nI asked God was I wrong for slaying demons and devils?\nAnd if so, forgive me, but now it's 2 wounded and 3 dead\nFrom shots to the head, these racist mother fuckers bled\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Interlude]\n\"Watch that 'boy' shit redneck\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just a hard workin' brother at Ford\nReport to work pronto amigo in my raggedy Accord\nAssembly working no smirking I get the job done\nWhite folks staring at me like I was Dennis Rodman\nFuck it\nIt must be the bandana I wear, saying black owned\nSee them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on\nSaw it comin' a mile away and it figures\nSomebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car \"Whites own Niggers\"\nPaid it no mind, now it's lunch time I'm eatin' quietly\nThen a voice said \"you don't belong in society\"\nI looked then I felt like gaggin' these white trash mother fuckers\nI heard that he was the grand dragon\nFuck him, I'ma tag him, skull drag him\nBut his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots\nThis is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous\nStigmatism is realism, the idealism is to hinder us\nPut his fingers in my face I bent 'em back\nHe said, \"you fuckin' jerk\" and told me to watch my back after work\nI punched out I walkin' to my car, I'm driving\nAnd I see this mother fucker, he's following me from afar\nPulled over like an idiot jumped out and said, \"what's happenin'!?\"\nWe started scrappin' he cut me with his knife, I took his knife, there goes your life\nGod forgive me because I slit his redneck\nNow all is left is the fuckin' dead peck\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Interlude]\n\"I sure do hate to see you like this, what if me and the boys was to shoot that nigger dead?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe demons are gonna kill me, I feel it comin'\nI'm a little piece of love, and a pit full of `em gunnin'\nThe pit is the planet, damnit it's full of killas and racists\nIf God make it I'm saying, God take it break it\nDemoni-acs of all colors, Crippers and Blooders\nArian brothers die, If you fuck with any of us God lovers\nA southern wind, hit the Midwest my mother cringed\n'Cause her vocalist, keep fuckin' with white national socialists\nEverybody wants to be the chosen God's people\nWhen teaching hatred hatred, at the steeple steeple lethal sequels\nWhen churches burn, we purchase germs\nLike guns to slaughter all the mother fuckin' surface worms\nBe warned, all fronts got the right to fall once\nAnd the racist be the ones we call dunce, down to die!\nFor my love so before you cease us\nYou got to what? Crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks\n\nSeason to kill evil\n\n[Hook]\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\nRednecks are the ones who bled next\nFirst they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked\nFor bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion\nThis is one of the many, many flaws of this nation\n(Red Necro)\n\n[Outro]\nA lot of people come up to me and they say they're not able to play you know what I'm sayin' the Absolute Power DVD you know what I mean, in the cars and stuff like that\n'cause they wanna hear stuff like you know \"The Grench\" and \"Freaky Lil' Things\" and all that, so you know a lot of people love \"The Grench\" and I love \"The Grench\" and they say it shoulda been on the album, so I put it on this album, you know, since a lot of people love it, it's produced by my homeboy RonnZfromBerlin you know what I'm sizzlin' this is \"The Grench\" check it out mate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a948579698830c97f054acf70a17900c.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
