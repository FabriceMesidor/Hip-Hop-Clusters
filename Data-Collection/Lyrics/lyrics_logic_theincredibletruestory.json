We\u2019d like to be writers, but as everybody knows\u2014we can\u2019t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that\u2014and uh\u2014forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...\n\nYou\u2019ll be doing things you don\u2019t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don\u2019t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you\u2019re doing, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is\u2014somebody is interested in everything\u2014anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...\n\nBut, it\u2019s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don\u2019t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we\u2019re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living\u2014in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up \"their\" children, to do the same thing. So, it\u2019s all retch and no vomit\u2014it never gets there. Therefore, it\u2019s so important to consider this question...\n\n\"What do I desire?\"\n\n[Outro]\nThe Incredible True Story\nAnd Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World\n\n[Scene VII]\n\n[THALIA:]\nSurface contact in 400 meters...\n300 meters...\n200 meters...\nTime of day is 6:28 Constant Meridian\n328 feet...\nOxygen: 100%\nTemperature is 17 degrees Celsius\n\n[KAI:]\nMan... what are the chances that there\u2019s some big-ass creature out there that\u2019s going to eat us?\n\n[THALIA:]\n100%\n\n(laughter)\n\n[KAI:]\nFuck...\n\n[THALIA:]\nClear skies\u2014\n\n[THOMAS:]\nKai, which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best?\n\n[KAI:]\nI would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill\n\n[THALIA:]\n114 feet\u2014\n\n[KAI:]\nMan, stylistically he\u2019s like\u2014what\u2019s the name of that bitch?
