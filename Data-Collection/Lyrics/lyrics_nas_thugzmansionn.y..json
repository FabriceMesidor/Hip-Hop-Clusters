Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nDear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle LaTasha sho' grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand\nOnly God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist, together\nThere has to be a place better than this, in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion\n\n[Chorus: J. Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nA place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide\nNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by\nNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets\nNo reason for nobody's momma to cry\nSee, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter\nBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support her\nThis whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me\nOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe\n'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'\nI'm just twenty-some-odd years\nI done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy\nI know she smiles on her boy\nI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur\n'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war\nAnd just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more\n'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne\nWhere angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion\n\n[Chorus: J. Phoenix]\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3a2b5d523ed4c1887dcd3d37b71c01d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
