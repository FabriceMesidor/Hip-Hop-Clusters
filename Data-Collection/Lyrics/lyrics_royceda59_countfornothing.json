You too can count for nothing\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the king of the backpackers\nThis T-bone contact to any wack rapper\nIt's biometric how I wet ya\nMy dialect's an entire weapon, it's set to just fire reckless\nBLAOW! Like (1-2) guns swoop\nIn the same booth the federales tryna run through\nLike, like (3-4) we raw\nMe and Vish' trade like a triple beam seesaw\nI'm a veteran, the Mac-11 the pump\nYou could name whoever you want\nWayne, Ye, Jay (Haha, I'm just playing with y'all)\nI keep the (4-5) on my hip\nYou take me serious then I might trip\nAbout (7-8) niggas and die\nFeeling some type of way, I figure it's pride\nI'm the right-on truth\nAnd that's right, I'm even plotting on my own crew\nJoey, Crooked, Or-tez, Slaughterhouse!\n\n[Chorus]\n(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)\nY'all been fronting\nWithout a ounce of thugging\nYou go against me? You too can count for nothing\nLike (1, 2) like (3) like\nYou (2) can count for nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm what choice is to option\nRoyce to hip hop is what Mike Buffer's voice to boxing\nYes, it's a couple dope dealers somewhere\nThat got rich living the shit that I spit (Me!)\nI don't re-enact nigga, I illuminate\nI know every point what I account like a Q&A\nIt ain't a arm when it's tucked in my box\nIt's Lindsay Lohan, niggas call me Fire Crotch\nI'm seeing clear like a MyBot\nI drop my coupe, black shoes, black Noob Saibot\nI spit fire like Izod, why not?\n'Cause Sho'nuff, I'm glowing like Taimak\nAnd y'all crying like babies over the net\nI should call you niggas Lady Gaga\nOr call, \"You and Em need to get together\nY'all need each other Nickel, Shady, blah-blah!\"\nIf I die I'ma leave heat\nI'mma leave the sun behind, I'm tryna repeat\nDon't try to ban the drummer\nHe's an animal and you can be a random number, uh\n\n[Chorus]\n(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)\nY'all been fronting\nWithout a ounce of thugging\nYou go against me? You too can count for nothing\nLike (1, 2) like (3) like\nYou (2) can count for nothing\n\n[Verse 3]\nI put the gun to lames\nEeny-miny-Motown, play the numbers game\nFive shots on my block\nIs like for once, I see, like my pops is Cyclops\nWith both eyes, I see you got no sides\nBring it to your Chippendale neck with the bowties\nCall you \"Stan\"\nGrab a bitch ass like \"aye!\", call me OJ Da Juiceman\nI get away with murder\nThat Johnny Rocket in my pocket with my favorite burger\nI'm tryna shake it like a Polaroid\nThey said I couldn't do it twice, call me Soulja Boy\n\n[Chorus]\n(1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8)\nY'all been fronting\nWithout a ounce of thugging\nYou go against me? You too can count for nothing\nLike (1, 2) like (3) like\nYou (2) can count for nothing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13187be577e518c77f5c6ac278ec366a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
