Keep wishin'\nYou need to learn the rules and conditions\nThere's facts that you missin'\nSit back and take notes man, listen\nFirst of all, the foundation\nMoney is the root of all evil\nThe C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people\nLivin' like lotto, everything is everything\nAin't nothin' changed but the clothes that my money bring\nI'm makin' figures that I never thought possible\nYou tryna slow me down, you'll find yourself in the hospital\nMy crew got the army of Tecs, and Amacuras\nKid, you get your cap peeled backward\nFor years, I been tryna blow for years\nGettin' bent off my wet, spend a G on beers\nLivin' life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet\n'Til the coke oil drops to the bottom of the pot\nMy invincible  crew will never stop\nIf you lookin', you can find me risin' to the top, I'm a classic\nApproach my level and get your ass kicked\nFloatin' in the river witchya body wrapped in plastic\nI'm tryna make a half a million, triple in size\nBefore my eyes, another part of my team dies\nI could still hear his voice while he up in the skies\nWhile the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies\nIt's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up\nBut at the same time I love, and I can't give it up\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nI gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences\nCount all my blessings, add up my weapons\nCock back the nine, let my heat serve purpose\nSling, do my thing, organized fiend service\nTryna make a mil, it's stress, you know the deal\nSo we sling krills,  get your cap peeled, cause everything is real\nBut I wanna chill, laid up, in a jacuzzi\nSippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi\nTry to infiltrate my fort, get caught\nDead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts\nYou get your life lost, never found again my friend\nMission completed, watch you droppin' less than 10\nOn the road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches\nYour last resting place will be your ditch kid\nNo one can stop me, try, your style's sloppy\nYou wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy\nThe theme is all about makin' the green\nLivin' up in luxury, pushin' fat whips and livin' comfortably\n\n[Hook: Prodigy x2]\nMy life is all about riches, and bitches\nSnitches get stitches\nLifestyles of The Infamous\n\n-Phone conversation between Prodigy and Havoc-", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5285e9def5b4b96755f32ab86f2dc24d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
