Heads up!\nHere's another one!\nAnd a - and another one\nOOHHHHHHHH!!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek! (Woop woop!) why you all in my ear?!\nTalking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!\nGet back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!\n(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)\nYeek yeek woop woop!! I ain't playing around!\nMake one false move I'll take ya down\nGet back muhfucker! You don't know me like that!\n(Get back muhfucker!! You don't know me like that!!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWHOO!! S-s-so c'mon c'mon\nDON'T ... get swung on, swung on\nIt's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs\nFamily off the street! made my homies put the baggies back\nStill stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)\nAnd dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats!\nThat's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back\nCause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack\nBut I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin\nJust thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin\nWe all in together now, birds of a feather now\nJust bought a plane so we changing the weather now\nSo put your brakes on, caps put your capes on\nOr knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown\nCause I'll prove it! scratch off the music!\nLike hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek! (Woop woop!) why you all in my ear?!\nTalking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!\nGet back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!\n(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)\nYeek yeek woop woop!! I ain't playing around!\nMake one false move I'll take ya down\nGet back muhfucker! You don't know me like that!\n(Get back muhfucker!! You don't know me like that!!)\n\n[Bridge]\nI came (I came) I saw (I saw)\nI hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)\nI came (I came) I saw (I saw)\nI hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)\nI came (I came) I saw (I saw)\nI hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)\nI came (I came) I saw (I saw)\nI hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee I caught 'em wit a right hook, caught 'em wit a jab\nCaught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass\nSent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!\nNo trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!\nWe split like two pins at the end of a lane\nWe'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain\nPut a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain\nThen put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek! (Woop woop!) why you all in my ear?!\nTalking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!\nGet back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!\n(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)\nYeek yeek woop woop!! I ain't playing around!\nMake one false move I'll take ya down\nGet back muhfucker! You don't know me like that!\n(Get back muhfucker!! You don't know me like that!!)\n\n[Bridge]\nHEY! You want what wit me?!\nI'm a tell you one time, don't FUCK wit me!\nGET DOWN! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose\nI'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!\nYou want what wit me?!\nI'm a tell you one time, don't FUCK wit me!\nGET DOWN! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose\nAnd I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan! Cause I don't wanna do that\nI want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack\nSit back and watch the women get drunk as hell\nSo I can wake up in the morning wit a story to tell\nI know it's been a lil while since I been out the house!\nBut now I'm here, you wanna stand around running your mouth?!\nI can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so wassup!\nCan't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!!\n\n[Chorus]\nYeek yeek! (Woop woop!) why you all in my ear?!\nTalking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!\nGet back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!\n(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)\nYeek yeek woop woop!! I ain't playing around!\nMake one false move I'll take ya down\nGet back muhfucker! You don't know me like that!\n(Get back muhfucker!! You don't know me like that!!)\n\n[Outro]\nAh! We in the Red Light District!!\nAh! We in the Red Light District!!\nWHOO!! We in the Red Light District!!\nAh! We in the Red Light District!!\nWHOO!! We in the Red Light District!!\nWHOO!!
