It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it\nThere's no humor in it no more, you know\nI'm rollin' with a swollen bowling ball in my bag\nYou need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass\n\n[Chorus: Roxette]\nI know there's something in the wake of your smile\nI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah\nWe've built a love but that love falls apart\nA little piece of heaven turns to dark\nListen to your heart\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\nEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\nI ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\nEven if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\nI'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\nI'm supposed to set an example\nI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\nIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\nThat Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\nThere\u2019s a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\nI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\nIt was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit\nAnd even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\nI spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\nAnd I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\nThis ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\n\n[Chorus: Roxette]\nI know there's something in the wake of your smile\nI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah\nWe've built a love but that love falls apart\nA little piece of heaven turns to dark\nListen to your heart\n\n[Verse 3: T.I]\nI'm the man in my city ain't nobody wit me\nYou can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches\nI'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's\nAnd the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me\nSS'S on 26's watching some television\nShorty I'm never slipping got the berretta in vision\nAnd ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping\nReady to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping\nPimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missing\nPolices try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given\nAddicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children\nThink I'm bad now, shoulda seen me before I had children\nGive dick to ya daddy's daughter and dare her to have children?\nHope he got some insurance 'cause death her is enduring?\nKill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri\nStill my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping\n\n[Chorus: Roxette]\nI know there's something in the wake of your smile\nI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah\nWe've built a love but that love falls apart\nA little piece of heaven turns to dark\nListen to your heart\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nThere used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\nAnd wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\nBut now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\nThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\nIt's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin'\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\nAnd asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\nFuck it 50 smash 'em, mash on 'em, let him have it\nMeanwhile, my attention is pullin' in other directions\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication the same one that made me famous\n\n[Chorus: Roxette]\nI know there's something in the wake of your smile\nI get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah\nWe've built a love but that love falls apart\nA little piece of heaven turns to dark\nListen to your heart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
