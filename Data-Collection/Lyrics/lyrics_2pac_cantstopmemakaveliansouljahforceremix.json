Forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's\nRunnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed\nI'm under pressure, the stress will have me drinkin'\nThinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink\nWonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's\nThey after a playa, but I won't let 'em capture me\nI gotta thank the Lord for the weed and the nicotine\nI can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things\nI keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber\nPreoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger\nRollin' down the 405, beware of stangers\nHand on my 4-5; that's what the fame does\nI'm probably wrong, but I'll never know it till I'm gone\nFrom out the gutter where the jealous motherfuckers roam\nPass the weed let that Hennessey get to me\nBefore the penitentiary, let's get it on!\n\n[Chorus (2Pac)]\nSome say the Government will watch me\nBut they can't stop me\nI'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse\nAnd even if they pull their triggers\nThey can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas\nSome say the Government will watch me\nBut they can't stop me\nI'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse\nAnd even if they pull their triggers\nThey can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas\n\n[Bridge (2pac)]\nFuck them skinhead ass niggas\nFuck the police, and the clan, here's what we do to the motherfuckin' Clan, Let's move\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nThey got me mobbin like I'm Loc'ed\nAnd ready to get my slug on\nI load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on\nI ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me\nTrust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me\nBust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion\nBetter duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - b-blaaastin\nI'm a nut and drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high\nOn the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die\nTell me why? 'Cause this stress is gettin' major\nA buck-fifty across the face with my razor\nWhat can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone\nKeep my brain on the game and stay head strong\nThese sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep\nBut will they can I see\nAnd everyday it just a struggle\nSteady thuggin' in the streets\nAnd I'll be ballin' loc\nDon't let 'em make you worry\nKeep swingin' at these suckas till you buried\nI was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta\nWord to Mutha I'm touched\nI'm kickin dust up\nReady to bust\nI'm on the scene steady muggin' mean\nUntil they kill me\nI'll be livin this life\nI know you feel me\nThere's so much pain\n\n[Chorus (2Pac)]\nSome say the Government will watch me\nBut they can't stop me\nI'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse\nAnd even if they pull their triggers\nThey can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas\nSome say the Government will watch me\nBut they can't stop me\nI'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse\nAnd even if they pull their triggers\nThey can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
