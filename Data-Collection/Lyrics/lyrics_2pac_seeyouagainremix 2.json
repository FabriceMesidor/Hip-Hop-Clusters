Don't wanna lose you to this sucker\n\u2018Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta\nDon't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast\nNobody knows, on who controls will it last?\nBefore I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere\nAnd even if you stay with him today I'm still here\nI refuse to give up, \u2018cause I believe in what we share\nYou're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare\n\u2018Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know\nPassionately yours and I'll never let you go\nTell me, can you get away?\n\n[Chorus: Charlie Puth]\nIt's been a long day without you, my friend\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWe've come a long way from where we began\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWhen I see you again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
