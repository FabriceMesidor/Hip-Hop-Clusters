You don't know me?\"\nI'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie\nBoldly, she told me 'Oh you got moves'\nHer friends said 'No, really though, he's a good dude'\nAfter couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes\nBeing snapped by the papps, we shared the good news\nWe were engaged, though many was confused\nI'm from the windy city, so I will not lose...come on\n\n[Hook: Queen Latifah]\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nShe had a dope figure, y'all can go figure\nShould of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger\nI ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it\nLove happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock\nOr could it be, things go the way that they should\nFrom the, unexpected, love could be understood\nAnd in the real game, only love can win\nI got to win, cause I fell in love with her friend\n\n[Hook: Queen Latifah]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/770bd24febfc0a63f9121d6c884c0a74.316x350x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
