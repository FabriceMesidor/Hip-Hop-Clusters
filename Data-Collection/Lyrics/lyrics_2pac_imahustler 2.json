I'm gettin suspicious\nOf this bitch the line busy everytime I call her\nNow she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?\nI check the house before I bone, so we all alone\nAfter I nut I hit the highway -- see ya later\nTo all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[3rd verse: 2pac]\nThe bitch tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her like no other\nNow them other bitches wanna bone me\nI'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me\nI drink a fifth a Hennesey I don't think it's healty\nI see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast\nI watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfukers pass\nThey wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie\nI pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry\nNowhere to rest I'm loosin homies, ain't that a bitch\nWhen I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely\nI put the pistol to my head -- and say a prayer...\nI see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[4th verse: 2pac]\nThen tell me am I lost cuz I'm lonely\nI thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely\nNowhere to run I'm in terror -- and on one cares\nA closed casket at my funeral and on one's there\nIs there a future for a killer? I change my ways\nBut still that don't promise me the next day\nSo I stay thuggin with a passion, forever blastin\nI'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness\nThey wonder if I'm hellbound... well hell can't be worse than this cuz I'm in hell now\nDon't make me hurt you I don't want to -- but I will\nSeen motherfuckers killed over phone bills\nNever will I die I'll be back\nReincarnated as a motherfuckin mack\nI love it cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's\nI'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me... you don't know me\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHustlerrrrr", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
