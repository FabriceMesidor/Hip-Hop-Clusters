My big dipper's slappin\u2019 you in the face\nStep out of the shed, let the sun be felt\nOn your head as you undo Orion\u2019s belt\nOh nuts! I just crashed landed on the planet of the gay clich\u00e9\nTalkin\u2019 Milky Way, bouquets, Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bubl\u00e9\nSorry if I caught you off-guard with my five-second delay\nBut the jet-lag\u2019s making me loopy and my sales are soupy\nSoupy Sales!
