Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane\nIn search of fame, won't hurt to change\nFollowing the foot steps of past dealers\nEquipped with Ski masks, no witnesses as we blast squealers\nAnd now they feel us in this act of war\nMore casualties, no survivors\nAny man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders\nIn my quest for chips\nWe wear vests, equipped with automatic fire\nWe reply when my enemies trip\nMe and you against the nation\nWhispering while we conversatin'\n'Cause niggas died over information\nHow much more can we take\nExpect us all to wait\nThe world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay\nThey never wanted us to make it\nEverything that we possess\nWe had to fight and take it\nI think the president is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat\nMakin' a livin' out of my misery\n'Til he got a friend like me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n\n[Verse 3]\nPromise to visit\nI know it's rough in your cell\nReceiving mail to the county jail\nThis is hell\nWhen I was younger\nI could picture livin'\nIn luxury\nSo how the fuck did I end up in prison\nFuckin' snitches\nThey got me crossed by my own side\nI found him by his self\nNo drama, he alone die, nobody cry\nShould have never testified\nYou got my nigga 25\nSo now I sacrifice your life\nHelp to separate me and my dog\nBroken ties, why the fuck should I let you live\nWhen I'm dead inside?\nRapid fire my delivery\nI'm bustin' at they whole crew\nNigga, remember me\nHit up my Outlawz set\nThen throw my pistol in the ocean\nDitch my ski mask\nAnd get to straight coastin'\nIt's visitin' day at San Quinton\nAlways there to see your closest roaddog\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nI'm down for you so ride with me\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n\n[Small Hook]\nCome after us, best be complete\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\nCome after us, best be complete\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me\nNobody knows where we'll be\nMy enemies your enemies\n'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me\n\n[Outro]\nRight!
