I'd just shoot my way out\n\n[Verse 1: Scarface]\nFirst born to my momma\nI come from the place where you're promised\nTo die before your 21st\nYou'll be surprised what's underneath the earth\nDug dirt, I put bones there\nAll my enemies is gone now\nI can't sleep through the cold sweats\nFlashbacks, I'm a known threat\nGod fearing yet I'm evil though\nI think deep, I believe in ghosts\nEver felt the hand of a dead body?\nThen you know why I took my gun and head-shot him\nWar started over dope cuts\nI put what I live by on both nuts\nIt's either him or me so I say fuck dude\nI look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]\nFuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long\nMy M.O. is like \"fuck you!\"\nYou niggas been throwing rocks at the throne\nI'ma reach out and touch you\nI ain't gotta put no money on your dome\nMy nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for\nHoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!\n\n[Verse 2: Scarface]\nI live like I spit it\nRaised by the wolves so my mentality is \"get it\"\nA life on the streets takes commitment\nThe power that you gain gets addictive\nThe money being made gets you bitches\nA real nigga played the game like it's business\nA weak nigga facing time, go to snitching\nPlotting on his whole team 'cause he ain't wanna listen\nIf it was all good just a week ago\nTake your motherfucking charge, that's your key of dope\nWe all wanna eat, gotta feed folks\nTook an oath on the streets called a G code\nThat's what we live by, die for it\nI got homies standing firm doing time for it\nWe have five-K-one's, gun killers\n[?] bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]\nFuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long\nMy M.O. is like \"fuck you!\"\nYou niggas been throwing rocks at the throne\nI'ma reach out and touch you\nI ain't gotta put no money on your dome\nMy nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for\nHoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!\n\n[Verse 3: Scarface]\nThey jealous of me cause I shine bright\nGrind strong plus my mind right\nMy gun loaded up in both clips\nJump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth\nNo shit, this is music you can drive-by\nG's the only code we abide by\nBlunt burning in the ashtray\nPlaying faggot games and now your ass chafe\nNiggas wearing tight pants and high heels\nClaiming another nigga's hood that is not real\nI am still the hardest nigga being heard\nFuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?\nHe ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd\nNothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word\nI talk that shit that I can back, though\nCause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe\nTalk that big six but pack a double blank\nYou where trouble ain't\nJust another saint, fuck 'em!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8962738e6fdff4298d09683da33f7a92.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
