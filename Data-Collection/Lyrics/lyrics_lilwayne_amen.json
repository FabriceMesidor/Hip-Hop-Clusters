Beezy got killed\nAnd that was my nigga, I go way back with my nigga\nBut I know that's how it happened, my nigga\nShit is much deeper than this rappin', my nigga\nBut now they all rappin', my niggas\nSo now I must make it happen\nSo I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga\nNo fingers, I'm snappin'\nHappy for my nigga Lil Tagus\n'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him\nLast time we seen him was when Katrina hated\nShit, found his body like a month later\nRest in peace, boy\nHe was a East boy, and so was Wessy West\nHe was a good nigga, so I know he blessed\nAnd his daughter is a princess\nThis shit is harder than a bench press\nBut I'mma keep goin'\nAnd I swear I got a lump in my throat\nBut I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow\nSo if I cry, don't stop the beat\nI feel like my heart just stopped a beat\nMy nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki\nEither that or load the gat and go pop a G\nAnd because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine\nI pray his family and his momma's fine\nSo much shit just sit on this mind of mine\nI think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time\nI smoke back to back\n'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap\nOr I'd be in the can\nThank God I had dreams of being the man\nYeah, and fuck a man with a badge\n'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge\nThe 5-0 killed Naudy, good boy dead\nMan, you would've thought they killed cornbread\nShot him up, face down on the lawn\nNot to mention, with his handcuffs on\nNot to mention, they had plain-clothes on\nAnd the complaint goes on\nBut nobody do nothing about it\nThe jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded\nAnd hate is at an all time high\nEverybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod\nShit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up\nBut I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up\nI'm ready to shoot like a camera \u2014\nStay still motherfucker\nI'mma have to write my will this summer\n'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer\nYeah, and you can put that on my late Father\nOr my late Grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter\nOr my Grandfather, Larry Balsock\nThe old man hustled 'til his heart stopped\nAnd all I know of my real Pops is that he had money\nNo bank account, that brown paper bag money\nYeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money\nBut the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me\nBut look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me\nBut that's why when I see him I acts mad funny\n'Cause he's a joke to me\nDon't message, don't call, don't talk to me\nIt's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be\nAnd I make sure she paid like she wrote for me\nAnd I know she gets all hope from me\nAnd I don't ever wanna see her mope for me\nHopefully, but, truthfully\nThere is a day that's due for me\nBut we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees\nYou are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby\nAmen\n\n[Outro: DJ Raj Smoove]\nRest in peace to my cousin Kim Carbo\nMy nigga Vick\nRest in peace lil' Harold\nShoutout to my nigga Steveland!
