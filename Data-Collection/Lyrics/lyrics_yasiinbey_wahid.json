Now put your minds on that\nGet real or get back quit frontin face facts\nThe old timers say we're living in the final days\nGun smoke young folks living any kind of way\nGangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways\nMeanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates\nCrash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age\nAccess is instant and treachery is commonplace\nI sense the dangers and I'm not afraid\nBecause when all is said and done there's only ONE\n\nMan up playboy playing the game boy\nPull back spectacular aim boy\nSay what you say boy whoever could make noise\nAnd ride range off in the same voice\nConduct an arrangement with definite language\nIt's pure inspiration for this generation\nSpeak true free love\nBecause when all is said and done there's only ONE\n\nAnd the one can done so cool\nSchooling the young like Rev. Run (\"whose house?\")\nQuote Pac and tell 'em keep their heads up\nAnd when the pressure comes down press back and press up\nFret not ghetto world guess what\nGod is on your side the devil is a lie (alive?)\nThe Empire holds all the gold and the guns\nBut when all is said and done there's only...\nLa ilaha ill'Allah\n\nB.O.O.G.I.E.M.A.N", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b13acc0fe75405f9fde88d9e60c03a7a.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
