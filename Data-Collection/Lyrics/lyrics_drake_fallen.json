I will kill this song until it actually dies\nWith a military jacket and some pack supplies\nI won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive\nAnd all these A-list parties you fraternize\nWhere you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties\nBut you dont ever act surprised\nYou just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives\nThats why I love you\n\n[Chorus: Keshia Chant\u00e9]\nI've fallen please help me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8e4af9d70633a1703ccd3faf671871c.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
