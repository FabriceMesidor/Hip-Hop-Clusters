I can hear her crying in the bedroom\nPraying for money but never think would she be dead soon\nAm I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else\nI'm thirteen, can't feed myself\nCan I blame daddy cause he left me?\nWish he would've hugged me too much like him\nSo my mama don't love me on my own at a early age\nI'm getting paid\nAnd I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid\nWhere did I go astray? I'm hanging in the back streets\nRunning with G's and dope friends, will they jack me?\nCan't turn back, my eyes on the prize\nI got nothing to lose (I got nothing to lose)\n\nSay goodbye to the BAD GUY\nEverybody gotta die..\n(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)\nSay goodbye to the BAD GUY\nEverybody gotta die..\n(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)\nSay goodbye to the BAD GUY\nEverybody gotta die..\n(You need people like me..)\nSay goodbye to the BAD GUY\n(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say \"That's the BAD GUY.\")", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
