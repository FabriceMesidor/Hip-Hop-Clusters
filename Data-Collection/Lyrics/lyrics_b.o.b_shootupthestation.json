It's my intention for giving this transition\nThis is for the citizens livin' in glass prisons\n\nComing up in my position\nThe product of my condition\nWith a business plan in my hand and a vision of a politician\nIt's funny how we mirror what we witness\nCause this is broadcast television from the villa to the village\nSo therefore we go bang-bang\nOn your corporate mainframe\nWe don't want that watered down\nWe don't want that plain jane\nTake back that Diet Coke\nWe don't want the same thang\nThis is not a protest\nBetter yet a gang bang\nNow everybody sang\n\n[Hook:Santigold and B.o.B.]\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI'm in a different realm\nI live in alpha mode\nAnd I forgot already, what you about to know\nYou what know I'm ridin' fo'\nAnd that bullshit I just ain't vouchin' fo'\nI beat the game already\nNow I'm just trying to coach\n\nThe truth is scary, it's very revolutionary\nThe signal is gone and faded\nThe televisions are buried\nHave you heard of the beast?\nWell we all live in the belly\nInhabitants of the concrete jungle to Silicon Valley\nThere is nothing to fear, not even Illuminati\nAs evil as things appear, perception is just reality\nI ain't really here\nA holographic anatomy\nReally I'm on the ship with the Planetary Academy\nOut\n\n[Hook:Santigold and B.o.B.]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d18ebaef113d710715491da16422feee.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
