I can't hear\nBut I still hear the fallen ones in my ears\nWhy, why do we live to die, die?\nWhen it's my time, time, time\nI'll leave behind my end, my thirteen reasons why\n\n[Chorus]\nSay they wanna read my mind\nThey really wanna read my mind\nTelling you right now, all you'll find\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\nThey say they wanna read my mind\nDo you really wanna read my mind?\nI promise, all that you will find\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\nBlind, blind, blind\n\n[Outro]\nDaytrip took it to ten", "image": "https://images.genius.com/344ed7ed9b8c04f255224d6d69988725.275x275x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
