Cole (Sampled)]\nYeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nPac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin\nNo I.D. my mentor now let the story begin\n\n[Verse: Nas]\nI ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin'\nAlong comes a one son called a offspring\nThe Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn\nShe birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins\nI jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out\nScreams got in the game and took bread out\nThe nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel\nFreedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though\n'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas\nBut I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga\nMilitary hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up\nExecs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen\nStraight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer\nBut I had a appeal, I was a charmer\nYet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor\nThis shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby\nWe was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's\nBut the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps\nAnd who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad\nBut that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad\nAt least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats\nAnd it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great\nNigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face\nThey took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes\nAnd when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame\nSo point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same\nThe first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures\nA big difference between 'em but I get why you said it\nRadio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'\nGlobal warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'\nThat's some advice I never got\nIf I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock\nWhile you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you\nThat if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time\nNow I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd\nLike wow, you made your nigga Nas proud\n\n[Bridge: Nas]\nSo you ain't let Nas down\nIt's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga\nYou ain't let Nas down\nHow that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga\nYou ain't let Nas down\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nLong live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nSlick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin\nLarge Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf738f9aff510a62c4d44b5f76537b70.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
