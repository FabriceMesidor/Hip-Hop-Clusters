one?\nYeah, Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back\nAnd I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?\nPuffin' on this indo\nIn the studio with my partners out here\nPacific Heights in the house, know what I mean?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga\nYou gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga\n'Cause the police love to break a nigga\nSend 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas\nSo what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas\nStraight fools into rules and do niggas\nAnd one-time had enough of me\nI'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me\nThey wanna send me to the pen, punk, picture that\nI stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat\nIt ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it\nLife as a celebrity ain't everything they make it\nAnd ever since the movies these hoes try to do me\nIf they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me\nNow can you picture me coolin' at a night club?\nNothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug\nSince I wear a lot of gold, they plot\nDon't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones\nAnd, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty\nBut you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me\nYou'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager\nIt's beepin' while I cut you with my razor\nI'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous\nI got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us\nBut if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got\nYou love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop\nNow drop it\n\n[Chorus]\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\n\n[Verse 2]\nReflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected\nYou're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records\nThat's what they said whenever I would walk by\nI never tripped though, always kept my head up high\nEventually I knew that I would find my way\nAfter the darkest night always comes a brighter day\nAnd some would say, that turned away is all you'll get\nI just said \"Bet!,\" and never let 'em see me sweat\n'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all\nWhile non-believers were prayin' for my downfall\nAnd some would call and tell me that they wish me well\nBut in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell\nYo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent\nI hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went\nNever surrender, it's all about the faith you've got\nDon't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top\nAnd if you drop, at least you know you gave your all\nBe true to you, and that way you can never fall\nBut beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke\nJust like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke\nAnd when you're broke, they move onto the next dope\nAnd there you are, can't even pay your car note\nAnd when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed\nRemember how it felt and then remember this\nBe true to you, believe that there's no one bigger\n'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas\n\n[Chorus]\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis is for the critics if you live up\nPick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups\nI better see five stars next to my picture\nIf not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to getcha\nI told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut\nPlay me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked\nNiggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down\nI'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around\nAnd it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore, nigga\nIt's the way you throw them thangs in the war\nAnd to the marks that be talkin' all that shit\nScreamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch\nAnd the niggas that I ran into recently\nThe motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me\nYou little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger\nNow you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga\nMr. Troublesome, niggas tried to play me with the gat\nBut like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back\nYeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army\nYou tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G\n'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up, without they backup\nWhen they get jacked up, they crack up\nIt's strictly for my niggas at the show\nSo they know, not to play me like a ho\nStrictly for my\n\n[Chorus]\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-\nStrictly for my, strictly for my, stric-stric-\nStrictly for my niggas, makin' G's\nStrictly,
