Shout out to my nigga Yella\nDamn, I miss that... shit, a nigga having flashbacks\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I open up my book I think about the world later\nNo ink in the pen, no lines on the paper\nI'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary\nI'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary\nSometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind\nI'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high\nI'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary\nI'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary\n\n[Outro: Trumpet]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19804ba7a9b6ceb36d0158950514927a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Dr.\u00a0Dre"}
