But before you do, let me swallow you. Let me lick you in all the right places. I want you to cum all over me, and when you do, I'll bathe you. And then we'll get out the tub, and we'll fuck, and I'll lick your ass, and I'll braid your hair, and you can fuck me anyway you please. We can do almost anything, but once we're finished, and you're happy here, you have to go back home to your wife. But don't you ever forget that I'm your wife in law...\n\n[Produced by Dr. Dre]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4102489ca8934c81cdf553b85cec18fd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
