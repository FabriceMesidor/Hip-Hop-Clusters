Dot move, something not like you\nHave your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you\nWatch how K. Dot move, something not like you\nHave your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you\n\n[Verse]\nUh\nWho's sick as me?\nTell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real\nAnd as far as my eyes can see\nI'm the only one fucking with me\nMyself, so put your album right back on the shelf\nAnd let real business get dealt\nYou ladies man like Leon Phelps\nI pee on any man tryna discontinue my health\nI don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt\nYour small mercy won't help\nWhen shots circle around your waist like designer belts\nI design your face, the [?] lift ya up\nRock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy\nWhat you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?\nIt's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years\nNow it's back to the basics\nK. Dot's nothing to play with\nA nigga tried to test my gangsta\nI pulled out a weapon and aced it\nMy grade point average at the top of the brackets\nI'm sick like a cancer patient\nAssist many players like personal agent\nY'all as foul, clothes to fragrance\nI'm the best now\nPlus the kid married to rap, old cats need to renew ya vows\nSit down, practice your verbs and nouns\n'Cause I'm on the verge to progressin' my words\nI'm the best you heard today, hands down\nSo hand down whatever you had\nLike you been in a bag\nPut it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had\nEver since, oh yeah, intelligence\nK. Dot, so heaven sent", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d86c80235f3ffef2492fec6dac85b33.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
