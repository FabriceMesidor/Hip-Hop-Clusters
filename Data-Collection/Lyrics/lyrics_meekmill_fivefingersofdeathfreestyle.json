did love us\nI'm putting checks on niggas even my kid's mother\nAnd you ain't real if you gon' let them kids suffer\nNiggas killed your cousin and you ain't did nothing\nExpect run to the cops and tell them pigs something\nThirty two in my Glock I'm trying to bend something\nI could murder these niggas like I'mma win something\nBut they don't make war for that\nThere's friends with double edge knives putting swords to back\nVelour is black, Balenciagas on I'm strapped\nI put my dawgs onto money and on the map\nYou want to see me extending my hand that boy's a rat\nAnd I don't party in them clubs where informants at\nCause they watching, and the listening\nAnd they plotting with they people they whispering\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nIt don't get no realer\nSixteen with a body he a killer\nRunning around with a stick like Donatello\nMan these niggas out to murder for that chedder\nI'mma tryna tell ya niggas scheme for that green paper\nHommies killing hommies over fiend paper\nHommies killing hommies over leaned paper\n\n[Verse 3: Meek Mill]\nThere should be the real nigga Grammys\nWhere we buy  Rollies and treat them like trophies\nYou'll never understand me\nYou ain't come where I come from\nNiggas on Xannies, mommy on crack how we going to feed the family\nMight as well start selling it, everybody inhaling it\nYoung, black, and intelligent what they should have been telling us\nBut they was locking us in a cell with a stranger for them to raise us and wonder why we rebellious\nNiggas going through pain\nI was missing from school cause I was going through things\nNow I'm getting this money feel like I'm going through change\nNiggas driving me crazy they threw it all for the fame\n\n[Verse 4: Meek Mill]\nMoney ain't the root of all evil its attention now\nKnocking down schools in my city to bring a prison 'round\nThey killed Chinx Drugz in his own city\nThey killed Lil Snupe in his own city\nWonder why I don't be in my own city\nI don't know if niggas gone clap for me or going to kill me\nStill living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage\nAll these guns and automatics\nStill gonna murder these niggas that want to have it\nBefore they have me miss my son\u2019s football practice\nFuck y\u2019all niggas that killed Lil Snupe\nAnd when we run into y\u2019all niggas we gone kill y\u2019all too\nI still pray every young nigga feel that coupe\nCause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you\nFifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie\nI pray to god, load my chopper, tell them niggas I\u2019m ready\n\n[Verse 5: Meek Mill]\nIn the middle of the summer\nIn the middle of the summer\nIn the middle of the summer\nSummertime nights out and we bring them bikes out\nYou could turn the lights out cause we got all this ice out\nWe up in here serious going crazy\nYoung boys getting to the [?]\nLooking at the media they say I got a baby\nOn the way by Nicki I'm thinking the media crazy\nYoung nigga getting to the money\nDreams Worth More Than Money it ain't funny\nStarted from the bottom I remember I ain't have a dollar\nI bought my first Impala\nThen I bought a Rolls Royce cause I came up from the bottom they ain't give me no choice\nJudge gave me five months in jail, felt like I was in Hell\nTwenty three I was in the cell\n\n[Verse 6: Meek Mill]\nSorry your honor if I was too arrogant, that money was staggering\nThey locked me PC with them trannies and rat, man that shit was embarrassing\nTwenty three hours in the cell by myself, man you couldn't imagine it\nThey fed me some shit I wouldn't feed to my dog, man that shit was the nastiest\nCan you imagine me losing my mind\nDoing push ups 52 at a time\nDo the whole deck just to get through the time\nJust to get back to my son and get back to my mom\nCause Papi keep asking me where am I at\nI told him in jail and I said I'll be back\nHe said when you back can you get me from school\nShit like that there turn boy to a goon\nOn to the graveyard its only one stop\nWe live fast die from gun shots\nAnd in this lifestyle we sling dope, bust Glocks\nWhy you think we say fuck cops\nCause when they lock us up all the fun stop\nAnd when the ice cream truck come it wouldn't stop\nSo for them little babies all the fun stops\nThey turn to goons and we post on the corner like a bus stop\nWaiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock\nThey put shackles on us like jewelry we say fuck rocks\nCause all we ever wanted was to sell blocks\nTo get a little real estate to sell blocks\nUntil we got a little taste of cell blocks\nAnd try to turn to God when these cells lock\nHave mercy on me touch down catch a case trying to sell rock\nAnd we didn't want to believe that Hell's hot\nMy mom told me you might as well stop\nCause you can't ride your weight when the wells drop\nAnd your waters off and your bills due\nAnd your shit stank smell like mildew\nCause you got wet all up and left there cause them little niggas done killed you\n\n[Verse 7: Meek Mill]\nIn the kitchen like grandma\nPut these bitches on stand by\nWhen it come to getting this money fuck everything no playing time\nIf you real nigga you can't mind\nReal niggas we can't die\nChristian Loubs on their period cause their soles blooded like a tampon\nI used to pray to God to get a brick nigga\nPrayed to God to be a rich nigga\nPrayed to God to get a brand new Rollie\nAll flooded on my wrist nigga\nTiming is everything\nI love all my niggas and my family is loyal\nI'm buying them everything\nPut Papi through college and everything\n\n[Verse 8: Meek Mill]\nI go out of my way to go out of my way\nI give my momma a thousand a day\nLike Benihana's we chopping the weight\nCause we get that work put the profit away\nHow would you feel if you came up from nothing and one hundred mil just a comma away\nMy youngins got youngins that got in the game\nCause we was out trapping when doctor was Dre\nRollie diamond the face\nLook how I bust down the band I might slide to your and stop in the A\nHold up, look how I just took this bitch take her straight to the mall have her shopping away\nHold up, what you want some red bottoms\nBalenciagas [?]\nShit I'm about to get some head out her\nI have her twerking for a nigga that's cardio\nI could kill all these rappers on audio\nVideo tape it and record it though\nI park my whip in the handicap, why is that, cause that bitch retarded though\nI could do the Bently or the Rolls call the audible\nSwitch it up but I probably do the Rarri though\nPick it up I forgot how that go\n\n[Verse 9: Meek Mill]\nNone of you niggas put fear in my heart, we only fear going broke\nAnd none of you niggas put fear in my heart, we cut your head by the throat\nNever would hang with you suckers and rats, unless its a chair and a rope\nCome in my city we live like the Mafia, and bitch I'm the head to the boat\nMillion dollar dreaming, really I was scheming\nFeeling like a [?] when I'm off the lean\nI said why you talking we don't back and forth with niggas I feel like I'm Venus\nNigga I fill up arenas, get on my level\nGet on my level and maybe we hear all that shit that you talking\nI heard you say you running the city and seen you in traffic and niggas was walking", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6929169de7116d41676151bdea5cc773.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
