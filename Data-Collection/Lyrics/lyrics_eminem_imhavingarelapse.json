Well, thank you, Jason\nThere goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma\nJust give me one more Soma and I'll be done for mama\nGo in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it\nShoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet\nIt seems like everyday I get a little flakier\nThe medication is making my hands a little shakier\nHand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up\nIt'll only take me a second to choke his trachea\nBreaking his neck in eighty-some places baby, here Shady comes, lady\nHe's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby\nYou b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums\nYeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?\nThere's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum\nA head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?\nWho's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde\nHair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms\nClearly there's somethin' wrong, cause she didn't come home\nShe's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on\nI guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs\nNow everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
