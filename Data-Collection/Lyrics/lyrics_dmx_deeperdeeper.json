What if I should die?\nA place inside my brain, another kind of pain\nYou don't know the chances.. I'm so blind\nBliiiiind\nBliiiiind\n\nAnother place I find, to escape the pain inside\nYou don't know the chances.. What if I should die?\nA place inside my brain, another kind of pain\nYou don't know the chances.. I'm so blind\nBliiiiind\nBliiiiind\n\nDeeper and deeper and deeper is all I'm turning to\nLiving a life that seems to be, a lost reality\nThat can never find, a way to reach my inner\nSelf-esteem is low, how deep can I go?\nIn the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to\nSee through the grey that clouds my mind\nThis time I look to see what's between the lies\n\nI can't see, I can't see\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm going blind\nI'm blind\nI'm blind\nI'm blind\nI'm blind", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a4366ca22169cc286a183e693f3a6ee9.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
