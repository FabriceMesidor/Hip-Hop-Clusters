after\nGave that nigga a bible\nAnd I was like \"Yo wherever you go, take this shit with you\nYou feel me, and you gon' be good\nLike I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas\"\nLike all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it\nBut niggas be taking their life for granted like\nYou know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't\nYou got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga\u2026\nI feel it\nSoul music\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\n[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]\nTell me what the fuck an angel does\nWe're seeing kids who ain't aged enough\nGetting high off angel dust\nFrom NY to Los Angeles\nThere ain't no love\nIn the heart of the city\nLooking where they car be at\nAnd they party at\nCardiac arrest can feel risky\nReal pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah\nCats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em\nShit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em\nPull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin\nWith pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it\nHe's something that you'd invest in\nCatch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'\nPop up and poop out something like intestine\nNo corrections cause the mic been checked in\nThe only time he be asking is when he sexing\nMy team like teenage mutants and X-men\nFire spark when I step in\nHe the human torch\nInhaling fumes of all sorts of course\nSteez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts\nSo when we stop by the D we never get caught\nI say it again we face L's but never lost\nEither be a warlord for 6 fees short\nEach day in this living hell feel remorse\nBut he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\n[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]\nYo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a \"L\" in my hand\nRemotely passed off like the generous man\nAnd they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand\nBut don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nThey couldn't walk this way in my J's\nIt wouldn't feel despair, but disarray\nLike their souls disappear\nSon got hot flows, got dropped like disarray\nCouldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed\nCovered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!\nEven through shades of black\nI see brighter days looking back in fact\nSo I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find\nA gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine\nGotta make it all mine if you don't mind\nCause sometimes\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\n[Verse 3: Dessy Hinds]\nRight on the block where they sit and play\nLives the vicious ways where they spit and spray\nVicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday\nIt's nothing but the history\nProtecting ya' from being history\nAnd then the next day your face is just a mystery\nFor niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies\nEven the lightest hours requires heavy artillery\nAccelerate without the breaks of a break\nAnd still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate\nAll in a day's work of God and his grace\nYou wanna eat then tell God and say grace\nAnd avoid the heat getting the boil to surface\nA soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place\nBecause the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface\nBut the ill-minded child, is ill minded child\nGot a round of styles\nKilling niggas' mental like a round of shells\nVery well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number\nPraying that 2047 ain't the highest number\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\n[Outro: T'nah Apex]\nGet off my cheeks let me do my thing\nInterrupt the wave length\nLive and let live\nAnd people talk smart got the balls to say\nThey apex and standing for this way\nBut got nothing to show or give\nI ain't judging", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccc6b3e099d7f0a3416209e4a5d67fd0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
