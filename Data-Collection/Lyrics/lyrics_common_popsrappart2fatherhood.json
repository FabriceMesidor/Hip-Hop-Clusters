I understand I'm finna' be a grandfather\nAnd I'm so proud\nI can say that in many ways, I can say I'm so happy, I'm so proud\nYou know? Son I wanna give you, you know?\nAny direction in parenting at this stage\nBecause I think it's gonna come to you, just like it came to me\nSee you came to me and your mom from the spiritual world\nWe're just the physical parents, you know?\nGod loaned you to us, as God's spirit\nWe're the physical parents, you know?\nLike I say, I'm not gonna give you no directions, you know?\nBut, I know when you started teaching me\nSee we talk about the life and education of one Lonnie Lynn\nI think I'm the one that got taught, I do believe that, son, you know?\nAnd I know when you started teaching me too\nYou know, I was hanging out, mad at the world\nMy professional basketball career was over\nAnd I didn't believe in the red, white and blue anymore\nAnd I was dissipatin' heavily, I wasn't experimentin', you know?\nAnd one morning you looked across the table at me, it was like \"What? Whatchu' gon' be? Whatchu' gon' do?\nYou got the responsibility to teach me the right things\nYou got the responsibility to teach me truth and respect and love, and safety\"\nYou know? And my knees started gettin' a little stronger, you know?\nI said, cause I can't get past these eyes man, it's just the eyes of a babe looking at me\nAnd I couldn't look it off, I couldn't even play it off, you know?\nAnd immediately I started gettin' the road maps seein' like how am I gon' do this?\nI had to thank The Almighty for the strength, that he sent to me through you\nSo, I'm here to say, you know, thank you son\nI'm here to say I'm so proud and numerous other things\nCause you've been a teacher to me, just like, I have supposed to be a teacher to you\nCause a lot of people think that parenting and raising a child is a one way street\nBut, you taught me continuous numerous lessons\nAnd I love you my son", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c13069157cf82b06434a58c5005ed904.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
