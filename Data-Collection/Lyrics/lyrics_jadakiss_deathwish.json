I pop at your head, fuck up your memories\nI put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce\nYeah, if you don't remember shit you goin' remember this\nI'm knocking niggas down this year, I'm on my timber shit\nBig lion growl at you niggas on that Simba shit\nI'll be on that \"Fuck yo' clique, I'll kill every member\" shit\nCold as December shit, bang in any weather shit\nAnd they could buy your bag with body parts sold separate\nYeah, that's a bet bitch like Russian Roulette bitch\nWeezy be the genie in a bottle, here's your death wish", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58fa7c7864db64385f428007093bd731.450x450x1.png"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
