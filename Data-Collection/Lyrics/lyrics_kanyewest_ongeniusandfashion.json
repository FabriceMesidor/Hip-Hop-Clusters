I want to be scared. I\u2019m trying my best to be scared. I\u2019m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don\u2019t want to talk. I don\u2019t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I\u2019m just going to tip-toe on this\n\nI\u2019m scared of anonymous comments online. I\u2019m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn\u2019t give me already. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared.  I\u2019m so shook. I\u2019m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo\n\nYou ain\u2019t never seen, you ain\u2019t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y\u2019all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y\u2019all for giving me this moment in time. \u2019Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There\u2019s so many people have a moment and they don\u2019t own it\n\nYou know, it\u2019s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there\u2019s the connotation of that. But what I need y\u2019all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y\u2019all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y\u2019all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius\n\n\u2019Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it\u2019s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you\u2019re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you\u2019re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth\n\nYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they\u2019re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren\u2019t going to talk about the money we made. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had\n\nAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, \u201cBaby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.\u201d And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn\u2019t be no song called \u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. \u2019Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. \u2019Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don\u2019t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time\n\nAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he\u2019s at the such and such show, and that\u2019s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can\n\nSo I said, \u201cWait a second, though.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,\u201d and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d They said, \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d Don\u2019t let me sing because I want y\u2019all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, \u201cHey that\u2019s cute, that\u2019s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.\u201d Like it\u2019s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn\u2019t be no Kanye west if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nBut the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don\u2019t want to break their motherfucking cool, don\u2019t nobody want to look like a fool\nMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn\u2019t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don\u2019t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they\u2019re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I\u2019m saying? Have y\u2019all ever read or heard someone say, \u201cI don\u2019t like Kanye West\u201d?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, I wish I could be likeable like them.\u201d I wish people would like me like that\n\nSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week\u2026 Let me explain something to you\u2026 I don\u2019t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That\u2019s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized\n\nSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn\u2019t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he\u2019s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let\u2019s rewind, is above a music producer, and it\u2019s above a rapper\n\n\u2019Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can\u2019t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you\u2019re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, \u201cI am a god!\u201d Just for them to let you a little bit up\n\nBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell\u2019s such a nice guy. \u2019Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted\u2014I didn\u2019t price it, but the world reacted to it\u2014I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that\u2019s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. West, but you\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else again.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I said, \u201cBut wait a second. I sold out.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.\u201d\n\nAnd right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. \u2019Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?\n\nAnd what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I\u2019m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin\u2019 tight jeans that you want. I\u2019m the nigga that, you know I\u2019m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can\u2019t go to Riccardo\u2019s show and you can\u2019t go to Phoebe\u2019s show\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn\u2019t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y\u2019all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what\u2019s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do tell me I can\u2019t go to these shows again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I\u2019m a musician, I don\u2019t have any ideas for clothing again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?\n\nBut I\u2019mma tell y\u2019all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I\u2019mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal from people\u2019s ideas like H&M. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal people\u2019s ideas like Zara. We gon\u2019 make our own shit. We gon\u2019 combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon\u2019 take them from Harvard, and we gon\u2019 take them from St. Mark's, and we gon\u2019 take \u2019em from the street\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. I\u2019m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I\u2019m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song\u2026\n\nHold up, hold up. I\u2019m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin\u2019 now!
