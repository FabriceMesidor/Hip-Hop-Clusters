And bring it back\nThe best and my cleaver came with me\nYo, King with me, reload quickly\nI'm surely down fifty a cheeba, elloquently\nI relax in the Waldorf\nUnder the covers, and the sword off\nSweat this shit, growing a mohawk\nReady to blow off", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19a80eba7163d77cbc2f82096b06010e.612x612x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
