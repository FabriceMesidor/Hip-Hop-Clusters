Em, Em! You puttin' that shit up your nose again?\u201d\nAnd I was like, \"Nah\", nuttin', like, everything was just spinnin'\nI couldn't even see, and like, he started to look like a monster and shit\nThen I just started laughin' and threw up all over the fuckin' floor\nIt's crazy\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nMy music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it\nIt's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it\nYou probably do what it said to do just from listenin' to it\nIt's got the power to get you to do it (Come on!)\nSo when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off\nSome bitch get slapped, some motherfucking kid get stomped (Aaahhh!)\nSo get this song, go run out and buy this disc\nAnd try this shit, as much coke as I just did\n'Cause times like these, got me doin' lines like these\nPlus, I grab a pencil every time that I light weed\nIt's probably because of the drugs; Shady does what he does\nAnd is what it is; I'm dizzy, Bizzy, visit these kids\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre & (Eminem)]\nHey, Stephanie (Hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (Okay!)\nNow pull your pants down, bitch, and have sex with this dog next to me (Huh?)\n\u2018Til I'm dead I'm takin' blunts to the head\nNeedles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead\nThese mescalines got me sure\nThat I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour\nWho slipped this downer in my Snapple?\nCussin' out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)\nFuck it, I was born with half a brain\nSniffin' 'caine, at celebrity basketball games\nYou motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick\n'Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (Uuuuhhhh!)\nThe last time I sniffed blow\nI ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show\nBizarre be smokin' a half a pound\nFuckin' the engineer's wife, while he's mixin' my song down\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nIt's\u2026 (It's\u2026) be\u2026 (be\u2026) \u2026cause (\u2026cause) of\u2026 (of\u2026)\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\nIt's because of these drugs that I do that make me\nDo these things that I do, do these things that I do\nBe\u2026 cause\u2026 of\u2026\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\n\n[Spoken: Eminem]\nIt's like, back when I first went on tour\nI like, went crazy; I was like, out of control\nAnd\u2026 just was fuckin' wasted every night, like\nWakin' up the next morning like, \"Where the\u2014\"\n\"Where the fuck am I at? What the fuck is goin' on?\"\nYou know what I'm sayin'? I was just like, out of control\n\n[Verse 3: Swifty McVay & (Bizarre)]\nThese Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin\nEight years old swallowin' Anacins, standin' over my bannister\nLaughin' with a chromed out caliber (Ha ha ha ha ha ha\u2026)\nThe weed that I'm sellin' is black, look like the back of a tarantula\nI keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura\nSmashin' it, after framin' a nigga with smack and dust\nI'm scandalous; drugs been ran for months\nCrackin' capsules to expand our blunts\nI rolled it up and take the pressure to the head\nNow I'm lookin' like a extra on \"Night of the Living Dead\"\nUntil they find me on a stretcher\nI'm quick to sample anything; bitch, you got a tester?\nThis crank'll have me blowin' up banks like Uncle Fester\n\n[Verse 4: Proof & (Eminem)]\nAaaahhhh\u2026\nWatch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend\nPop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines\nGhetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens\nGot a Jell-O spleen, and see yellow rings (Ooohhh\u2026)\nBlue pills and purple mushrooms\n(Hey, little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)\nMissin' since yesterday, perfect just for rape\nSee, I'm on Judgment Day, numb from Special K\nTwo tabs of X and vitamin C\nSwallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3\nGrindin' the teeth at the signs of the E\nI lost six days at a time in the week\nThe crime in the street hold your parents for ransom\nWhile D12 gang rape Marilyn Manson\nIn twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic\nBarf up my stomach linin', drown in my vomit\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nIt's\u2026 (It's\u2026) be\u2026 (be\u2026) \u2026cause (\u2026cause) of\u2026 (of\u2026)\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\nIt's because of these drugs that I do that make me\nDo these things that I do, do these things that I do\nBe\u2026 cause\u2026 of\u2026\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\nBe\u2026 cause\u2026 of\u2026\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\nIt's because of these drugs that I do that make me\nDo these things that I do, do these things that I do\nBe\u2026 cause\u2026 of\u2026\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\nBe\u2026 cause\u2026 of\u2026\nThese drugs I do; that's why I do the things I do\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\n'Cause I like, I always tell people, you know what I'm sayin'?\nLike, if you got an addiction, don't admit it, to nobody, you know what I'm sayin'?\nKeep that shit to yourself, because if anybody sees that, you know what I'm sayin'?\nWhen you're out in the public eye and shit, they're always gonna think that you're on that shit, even if you're not\nThat's why I always tell my friends, you know what I'm sayin'?\nBut, I mean, like, for me, I don't give a fuck; I'll probably end up dyin' from this shit one day\nProbably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like, \"Eminem dies from drug overdose\"\nYou know what I'm sayin'? And\u2014\nAnd my friends, they ain't no fuckin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?\nThey ain't nothin' but influences, bad influences to me, so\nIt's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure\nThat's what it boils down to, and\u2026 I give in to it, so do they", "image": "https://images.genius.com/591360993ef93e1c0a2402279fb90319.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
