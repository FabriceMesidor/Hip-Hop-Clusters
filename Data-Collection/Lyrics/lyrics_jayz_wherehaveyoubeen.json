Well they just liked you\n'Cause all they said was little Whitey look\nI'm just like you, but dog I can't see it at all, shit\nWe never kicked it at all, we never pitched or kicked at a ball\nDog, you never taught me shit\nHow to fight, ride a bike, fix a flat, none of that sorts of shit\nNigga you was an abusive pops\nFuck, you left me out to dry, stuck\nGotta teach News to box, gotta teach News to to block\nAnd that ain't the half of it man, I gotta teach News the block\nIt's about time we have a father to son (nigga sit down)\nSit down let me tell you 'bout your fatherless sons\nHow they grew to be men and father they sons\nFather they daughters\u2014nigga, you left a fatherless daughter\nI never follow your orders\nNigga you make me sick, pussy, you could... ooh\nHow you gon' leave these memories in the back of my mind?\nI can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom\nI 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9\nPut it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine\nYou turned me out, the reason why I hit the block\nReason why I tried to hit them cops\nReason why I started hitting shots\nReason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court\nGingerbread Man never think of getting caught\nLook at your hands, man\u2014damn you fought\nNigga you left my mom\nLeft us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry\nYou left us with no letters, notes, no replies (nothing!)\nNo digits, numbers was unlisted\nYou left us with some of my loneliest nights\nNigga, some of my hungriest nights\nShit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrassing)\nDamn, we used to think money was white\nYeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant\nWe ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps\nAnd to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop... shit\n\n[Chorus: L.

Why is life so ugly?\nMommy, why is your eyes puffy?\nPlease don't cry everything'll be alright\nI know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light\nIt's us against the world, we don't need him, right?\" (Right!)\nMommy driving 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah)\nI bought a nice home for both of my sisters now\nWe doing real good, we don't miss you now\nSee how life twists around, fucker?\n\n[Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)]\nDaddy, where have you been?\n(And when you come home, you got us here all alone)\nMommy, where daddy went?\n(You always take up for him, always said you'd make up for him)\nMommy, what happened then?\n(Who was you cheating on him?\nWhy he's always beating on you?)\nDaddy, where have you been?\n(Nigga, you gon' hear me out)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c91a9bc0eb9aaf290224ebeaabd243a0.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
