Down to fuck?\nIt's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut\nWith a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled\nRunning through a house of mutts\nIn other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up\nAnd I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!\nAnd ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink, player\nMy farts may have gotten staler ever since\nI became a trailer park celebrity\nMaybe my complexion became a little paler\nPoster child for white trash\nI'm a Garbage Pail Kid sailor, yeah\nSee me I'm all up on your bitch means I'mma rape her\nAll I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler\nSo bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up\nI don't subscribe to the News or the Free Press\nBut homie, I get the paper!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/92a4caddb38548f811a9d5b5599e4304.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
