We don't ever answer to\nNo King Tuts, no presidents, this is more like a ritual\nWhat am I scared of death for? Life is just an interlude\n\n[Verse 2: Dosage & Lupe Fiasco]\nLet's begin this interview, I know they got a lot of questions\nI dont have on a unitard, but I can answer the detective\nNone of these dicks can trace me, I don't go that direction\nThis is the beginning of a massacre, I'm tired of getting treated like a step-kid\nThis where I step in, cause this Dosage from Philly and he so sick\nAnd he my friend, so he yo friend, it's who Lupe Fiasco with\nThey wanna know if I'm insane, I just don't accept defeat\nBut since I'm nominated this is gonna be my acceptance speech\nYour big bro requestin' me 'cuz I'm a friend of the people and I'm next to be\nIn the game, I don't hear the referees whistling technically\nDixie, let me sing!\n(\"I wish I was in the land of cotton, old times, they are not forgotten!
