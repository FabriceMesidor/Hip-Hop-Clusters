When we in the car we 22'd up\nWhen we in the big truck we 24'd up, y'knahmean?\nWhen you see me ridin, real fast, your job, is to stay back\nPre-bumper - behind the bumper fam! Alright?\nDo not race in front of me\nI should not be able to see, your license plate\nThat means there's somethin wrong here\n\n[LL Cool J]\nThis is the biggest decision I ever made in my life\nYou do a hundred miles an hour on the highway at night\nYou go to fasten your seatbelt and make sure that it's tight\nBecause I'm rippin the paws just like I'm rippin the mic\nBaby I'm pushin the limits as if I'm racin a bike\nTell the highway patrol no need to chase me tonight\nThe way I'm doin my thang it's like I'm up in a plane\nI hit the stick in the rain, I guess I'm sick in the brain\nRocks hittin the frame, you think the shit is a game\nBut I'm ready for anybody that steps in my lane\nAnd I know you afraid, no reason to be ashamed\nNobody's crashin my party I'm mashin out on these lames\nI devoured the cowards and there is no doubt about it\nAll these niggas are too gassed, they can't run without it\nTried to give me a flat tire, I wouldn't allow it\nI left y'all in the dust nigga, I'm too high-powered!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Funkmaster Flex]\nExactly! When you see us, fast lane middle lane slow lane\nIt's all the same thing y'knahmean? We go fast\nWe got a lot of big wheels on our cars, it's what we do\nAight? When you see us, you salute the kingpins, the generals\nThat's us, y'knahmean?\nAnd matter of fact, we gon' jump off the Bridge right now\nWhen you see L, THIS JOINT'S IN FUCKIN EFFECT!!!!\nI've been DYIN to say that~!\nI've been DYIN to say that, eighty-six nigga!\nYou know what it is man, first album\nTen million, no fuckin video, yo LL was THERE!\nI WARN YOU! You gotta STOP!\nThere's too many questions and not enough answers\nToo many questions, mind your business knahmean?\nThis is grown shit right here, aight?\nWhen you see us, we do this for a living\nI've been doin this for a fuckin minute!!!\nYo I've been dyin to talk crazy on a L record\nThis is big for me man!\nWow!!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c13f17b61fb5401ffd0b607a7ca75ab.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
