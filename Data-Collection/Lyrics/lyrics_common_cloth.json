Sound of my heart when it drop\nThe night that I met her, it might be forever\nI hear people saying that they like us together\nI ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better\nWith you, I admit I had issues\nLike ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence\nIt's more than clothes can say for you\nWhen I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you\nI pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust\nAnd accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust\nFrom the cloth\n\n[Hook]\nOh you're worried about when people stop and stare\nThat's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear\nCut from the same, cloth you just want to wear\nBut that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh\nLa la la la, la la la la\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is tailor-made love, fit like a snug\nAnything we can bear so let's have some cubs\nYou were there when my cuz passed away\nNot only does love, but life hatches day\nI appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you\nStrong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you\nLooking at things that we've been through\nThings that seem simple\nI know when to go hard and when to be gentle\nSentimental laughs and expressions\nLet's stay in the present, no time for second guessing\nYou said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked\nThe truth we address it, that's so unexpected\nYeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead\nYour hunger for affection will always be fed\nThank God we never sped and let love take its course\nCause what's inside of us, no need to outsource\nThe cloth\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey lover we can cover each other\nThrough the coldest nights, tight never smother\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's two things that seems to hold us together\nGod is our tailor and forever\nIt's the cloth\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c8aea6a11c5d9bc44d2a6101d96d5aed.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
