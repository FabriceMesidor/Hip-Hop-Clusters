Eminem]\nEverywhere\u200a we go people know that we roll deep as fuck\nFourty fifty Samoans\u201a they knowing when D-Bo was 50\u201a Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us\nThey\u200a pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does\nFrom New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles\nWe've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust\nYou may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us\nIt's\u200a funny\u201a I guess money does have its advantages\nAnd it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched\nIt's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much\nIt's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch\nWe just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it\nCause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that\nYou fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at\nThat you got no business being in\u201a we ain't even gon be in it\nNo one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit\nAnd they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it\nThe noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd\nAnd you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing\nTill the club closes, and clears out and that's when they see you flatened\nNobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping\nAnd you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping\nIt ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off\nAnd it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off\n\n[Chorus - Eminem]\nShit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games\nWe ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names\nShit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause\nHip-hop is in a state of 911\nIt ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone\nIt ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more\nIt's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor\nCause hip-hop is in a state of 911\n\n[Verse - B-Real]\nStep off my holster cause shit it's getting serious\nAll these drugs you be fucking with make you delirious\nThinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious\nHow long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?\nSome people can never fade us, that make us so furious\nMistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious\nWe living for real and others just making the stories up\nAllusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks\nIf you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done\nWhen you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun\nGot a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none\nI'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb\nSilly little bitches can end up right up in ditches\nWe cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches\nYour game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit\nDealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nShit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games\nWe ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names\nShit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause\nHip-hop is in a state of 911\nIt ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone\nIt ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more\nIt's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor\nCause hip-hop is in a state of 911\n\n[Verse - Ganxsta Ridd]\nUh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit\nOn this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it\nWhen I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded\nMy appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it\nGot you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers\nBut you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour\nWhen you - enter the business you thinking you running shit\nYou witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!\nWe gangstas we blast first, ask questions later\nAll these - imitators parading like they some playas\nTrying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater\nCause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters\nGet caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring\nI'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying\nI'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed\nOn an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s\n\n[Chorus]\nShit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games\nWe ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names\nShit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause\nHip-hop is in a state of 911\nIt ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone\nIt ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more\nIt's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor\nCause hip-hop is in a state of 911", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
