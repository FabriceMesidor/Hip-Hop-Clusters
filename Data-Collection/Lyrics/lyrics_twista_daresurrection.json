Dre and I went berserk\nRunnin' through apples like anorexics through exits\nWhen it's man I flex it\nBest be protected cause ain't no antisceptic\nThis sounds hectic\nI strip rhythms naked when I mic check it\nHow does it feel gettin' fucked up by the least M.C. expected\nResurrected to wreck it for Chi-town to K-town\nIf you can't duck what's manifested I suggest you stay down\nInfrared and Speedknot Mobstaz is what I campaign\nDraw more blood than a artist\nWith a syringe when I vent brains\nStamp the names on the wall of those I'ma staff 'em\nDissection for testin'\nI told you pussy ass niggas it's the resurrection", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de56185a5feae8fc7307820980156a11.200x200x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
