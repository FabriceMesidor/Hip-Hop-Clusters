Jones and D. Bowe\nMatt Cassel, the battle with Ed Reed\nRay Rice lookin to part the Red Sea\nSo there's no time to be timid\nThe team that moves on will be the one that's controllin the line of scrimmage\nSo the player who penetrates can never hesitate\nAnd the losin team will get a date\nWith the couch at the house the one central fear\nWatchin it from home and waitin 'til next year\nSo while it's right here in front of you\nDo whatever it takes to get a W\nOtherwise it'll trouble you for months, and a stent won't fix it\nIce won't numb it, it's too deep of a sickness\nIt's called winless, and you don't want that\nYou gotta win this, handle your business\nBut never fall back, always attack\n'til the big girl sings if you want that ring\nSo leave it on the field and you just might take it\nAs long as you gave it and didn't save it\nWho wants it more?\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nPepsi Max is zero calories\nMaximum Pepsi taste", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/talib-pic.png"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
