Do right\nOh, whoa, whoa\nSoaring through paradise\nWhen I'm closing my eyes\nI'm Mr. Solo Dolo\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook at me, you tell me just what you see\nAm I someone whom you may love, or enemy?\nAm I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?\nI need some answers, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, whoa, whoa\nWhy must it feel so wrong\nWhen I try and do right? Do right\nOh, whoa, whoa\nSoaring through paradise\nWhen I'm closing my eyes\nI'm, Mr. Solo Dolo\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy world turns, flippin' the bird\nTo the ones who figure\nMe outcast, no, not the duo\nBack in Shaker Heights where they knew who\nDo's little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo\nCry me a river, hater, look who\nTraveled out an igloo\nCold, cold world wasn't fit for me at all\nLook at where I stand at, tall\nClutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls\nMute motherfuckers back home, quick pause\nGargle on my mayo\nLook at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail\nFloating in my mind, no sail\nAhoy, ahoy\n\n[Verse 4]\nListen good, I don't need nobody\nThis is what you feel, are the sounds of insanity\nHoping what I hear loops itself to finish me\nNo, I won't be afraid, hey, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, whoa, whoa\nWhy must it feel so wrong\nWhen I try and do right? Do right\nOh, whoa, whoa\nSoaring through paradise\nWhen I'm closing my eyes\nI'm Mr. Solo Dolo\n\n[Outro]\nWhy must it feel so right\nWhen I know that it's wrong? It's wrong\nWhen will I ever learn\nFrom the words in my songs?\nI'm Mr. Solo Dolo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/efc07c09f2ac2b595d950ffcf79a1a73.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kid Cudi"}
