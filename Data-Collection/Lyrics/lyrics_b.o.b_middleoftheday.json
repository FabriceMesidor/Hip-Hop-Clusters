Our departure will be around 4:20. Clear skies, sunny days. We are ready for takeoff. We have a go\n\nWasn't much to do, I dipped outta school\nHad to play it cool, I lit up that blue\nAnd then I flew away, in the middle of the day\nMan I gotta leave, I gotta escape\nI can't stick around, gotta fly away\nIn the middle of the day, in the middle of the day\n\nLook\nBrain's at my window pane, it feels like I'm livin in a video game\nBut ain't nothing changed, cause it's the middle of the day\nLook\nI said I'm puffin with my kin folk, gone off that endo\nJust doin that same old thing, with the same old gang\nSo can't nothin change\n\nLook\nEvery day the time goes by, passin me by\nParanoia on my mind, but I don't know why\nSomethin bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line\nDon't say much, keep a straight face\nIf I say somethin I'm crazy\nI think the government's onto me, onto me\n\nWasn't much to do, I dipped outta school\nHad to play it cool, I lit up that blue\nAnd then I flew away, in the middle of the day\nMan I gotta leave, I gotta escape\nI can't stick around, gotta fly away\nIn the middle of the day, in the middle of the day\n\nWell I done sacrificed a lot\nJust to get this rappin life to pop\nMeditatin on that after life\nAnd if a tragic happens then I pass my life to stop\nCause a brand new life's beginning\nBut I ain't intending for it to be tremendous like this\nThe old one I had is ending, so so long I'm finished\n\nFace to the floor getting so frustrated\nTryin to figure out the right words to say\nIt's me and the clock I feel like I'm racin\nNobody knows the trouble I'm facin\nMan I'm sick of waitin, gettin impatient\nWatchin my life unfold the pages\nAin't nothin much I can do to stop it\nThat's why I'm blazin\n\nEvery day the time goes by, passin me by\nParanoia on my mind, but I don't know why\nSomethin bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line\nDon't say much, keep a straight face\nIf I say somethin I'm crazy\nI think the government's onto me, onto me\n\nWasn't much to do, I dipped outta school\nHad to play it cool, I lit up that blue\nAnd then I flew away, in the middle of the day\nMan I gotta leave, I gotta escape\nI can't stick around, gotta fly away\nIn the middle of the day, in the middle of the day\n\nThis is your captain speaking for Cloud 9 Airways. We are now approaching our initial decent. We'd like to ask all our passengers to remain seated and buckled tightly. All those passengers who wish to continue flight for infinity, please report to first class for your frequent flyer miles\n\nWasn't much to do, I dipped outta school\nHad to play it cool, I lit up that blue\nAnd then I flew away, in the middle of the day\nMan I gotta leave, I gotta escape\nI can't stick around, gotta fly away\nIn the middle of the day, in the middle of the day", "image": "https://images.genius.com/adcf6114ce030b4f70858bc64c941f6f.496x496x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
