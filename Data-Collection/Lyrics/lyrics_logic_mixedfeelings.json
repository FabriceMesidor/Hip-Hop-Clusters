It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream... One day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6118bfdbbde22320e3c6bc130e1772d3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
