It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps\n\n[Hook]\nIt's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)\nIt wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)\nIt's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)\nIt wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)\nIt's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)\nIt wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)\nIt's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)\nIt wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
