Once I am done with him, I am going to whip my d**k out and piss on him ... right in his muthaf**kin face. Zimmerman is a piece of s**t and that\u2019s what he needs to drink.\"\n\nGAME:If you could do it and it was legal, and there was no repercussions for knocking Zimmerman out, why not?\n\n[TMZ: Is this justice you feel was denied?]\n\nIt's not really about that for me because, again, the Trayvon Martin story was sad enough. Justice needs to be served for his mother and his father and his family. I just think that how Zimmerman is playing it and being a media whore and looking for all this attention that he shouldn't be getting...If there's a chance to box him then I want in.\n\n[TMZ: Could you knock him out?]\n\nMan I believe I could knock Thor out.\n\nAll you need from Game is a YES. Draw it up and let's fight...I'll get in there and Zimmerman won't last three minutes.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
