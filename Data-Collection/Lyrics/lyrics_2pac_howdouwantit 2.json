Am I a fool or what?\nPositions on the floor, it's like erotic\nIronic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic\nI'm hittin' switches on bitches\nLike I been fixed with hydraulics\nUp and down like a roller coaster\nI'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over\n'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery\nI'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me\nGet her rockin' these, nights full of Aliz\u00e9\nA livin' legend you ain't heard about\nThese niggas play these Cali days\nC. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker\nInstead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother\nWorse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole\nYou're too old to understand the way the game's told\nYou're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts\nOnce I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that\nThey wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell\nLivin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell\nNow everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck\nI'd be the first one to bomb and cuss\nNigga, tell me how you want it\n\n[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you  feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you  feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nRaised as a youth, tell the truth\nI got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof\nLickin' shots off from the roof\nBefore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager\nGame rules, I'm livin' major\nMy adversaries is lookin' worried\nThey paranoid of gettin' buried\nOne of us gon' see the cemetery\nMy only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive\nGettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die\nI wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million\nAnd then I'm chillin', fade 'em all\nThese taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me\nMedia is in my business and they actin' like they know me\nBut I'ma mash out and peel out\nI\u2019m with a clique that\u2019s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out\nYeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it\nWhen you see me, tell a nigga how you want it\nHow do you want it?\n\n[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\n\n[Interlude: 2Pac]\nMe and my Nigga Johnny J...yeah we out\n\n[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real\n\n[Outro: K-Ci & JoJo]\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane, I'm for real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/633a6695e0eb3ac67dc8e29fb9fbcc64.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
