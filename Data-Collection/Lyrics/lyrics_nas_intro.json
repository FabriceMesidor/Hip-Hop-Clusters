You crying?\nY'all got into it again huh?\nSee you gotta let them know from the jump\nI don't care who they are, or who they're with\nYeah I know they know we're talking\nShh, why don't they just leave us alone?\nI know it's hard for them to understand people like us\nCould love each other\nCome on, stop crying now\nOh, there's something I gotta tell you\nI heard they're watching you\nYeah, they're watching, they're watching me too\nBut there ain't no reason to get low\nI'm proud, I'm here\nYou know I'ma stand up for you, no matter what\nAnd I know you'll stand up for me\nI don't have no doubts about you being true to me\nThe world is ours\nBut right now it feels like the whole world is against us\nSo study, be strong, don't cry no more\n\n*Immediately follows A Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65c98702fc773f6dafd41563fe5c5485.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
