Ivy]\nWe are all here for a reason on a particular path\nYou don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math\nCats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious\nThat's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes\nFor your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self-down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed\nWith a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI too dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\nCause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\n\n[Verse 4: Jay-Z and (Kanye West)]\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nThis is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'\nYoung the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThey way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
