And be yourself!\nWhen I was in church they taught me something else\nIf you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed\nThat Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned\nWhen everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless\nRather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen\nI might not be the same but that's not important\nNo freedom til we're equal\nDamn right I support it\nI don't know\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nMy love, my love, my love\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nWe press play, don't press pause\nProgress, march on!\nWith a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause\n'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law\nKids are walking around the hallway\nPlagued by pain in their heart\nA world so hateful\nSome would rather die\nThan be who they are\nAnd a certificate on paper\nIsn't gonna solve it all\nBut it's a damn good place to start\nNo law's gonna change us\nWe have to change us\nWhatever god you believe in\nWe come from the same one\nStrip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love\nAbout time that we raised up!\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nMy love, my love, my love\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nLove is patient, love is kind\nLove is patient (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is kind (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is patient (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is kind (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is patient (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is kind (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is patient (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is kind (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is patient (not crying on Sundays)\nLove is kind (not crying on Sundays)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8983d0c6fd7a87e846a12ba0c3a05815.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
