I don't know\nI gotta ask myself that question\nBooty's truly an option\nBut it's not gonna suit me like my girl Evan\n\n[Hook]\nI don't wanna do it but I can't help it\nI'm so selfish\nLady, what you want me to say?\nFoolish\nThe lies and deception\nI tried to confess it\nCommitted, but I still wanna play\nI don't wanna do it but I can't help it\nI'm so selfish\nLady, what you want me to say?\nFoolish\nThe lies and deception\nI tried to confess it\nCommitted, but I still wanna play\n\n[Bridge: Step Cousins]\nI don't wanna do it but I can't help it\nI'm so selfish\nLady, what you want me to say?\nFoolish\nThe lies and deception\nI tried to confess it\nCommitted, but I still wanna play\n\n[Verse 2: Step Cousins]\nIf I gave into the fact that you hate me and take me back\nI'm saving face by staying at the bar\nAnd embracing this Jack\nShe wanna leave, I can tell by the way\nShe react to the mouth piece\nNo more dollar drinks so she\nFollowed me with the house keys\nAnd I know what I'm doing is wrong\nHoping that you were the one\nBut out 'til like two in the morn\nWith nobody you wanna know\nIt's comforting to know you're home\nWhen I'm out on the road\nI know you're lonely though\nOr maybe got some flow of your own\nIn the looking glass, you shake your ass\nI sat back and I watched\nThen I took your hand, and we both danced\nWhile thinking of the thoughts\nIt might've been the circumstance that hurt\nThis man - I'm a circus act at most\nNobody's perfect girl, it's a perfect world\nBut we don't have to know\nAnd I'm not trying to justify it\nBut I might try to simplify it\nOne touch and I'm mesmerized\nSo I mess around in disguise\nFlesh to the eyes, test to the lies\nSex gets my vote unless...\nYou're destined to die with the one\nNext to your side\nFo sho\n\n[Bridge: Step Cousins]\nI don't wanna do it but I can't help it\nI'm so selfish\nLady, what you want me to say?\nFoolish\nThe lies and deception\nI tried to confess it\nCommitted, but I still wanna play\n\n[Hook: Macklemore]\nNow you know what's good for you\nGot that, not gonna warn you\nWe got that to make it right right right\nYou know all my women, I adore you\nBodies wanna absorb too\nThe energy, melody life life life\nNow you know what's good for you\nGot that, not gonna warn you\nWe got that to make it right right right\nYou know all my women, I adore you\nBodies wanna absorb too\nThe energy, melody life life life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a341d7269423ec87ff688b91d8b38e47.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
