Get for real\nMy whip appeal, my crib is real\nMy wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille\nHip-hop grunge nigga, I make her come quicker\nThen rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga\nI Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes\nEmojis fo' me and my people\nThe hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo\nI work they thighs, and they kegels\nSkateboard, I love Chanel\nRetweet me bitch, I'm @Pharrell\n\n[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]\nFirst the love was there\nThen the paper came\nThen the haters came\nBut we still rise above\nFirst the love was there\nThen the paper came\nThen the haters came\nBut we still rise above\n\n[Verse 3: Tuki Carter]\nYeah, I hustle no muscle, I'll never be muzzled\nI'm a piece to a puzzle, I'm Robert Townsend\nAnd my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle\nMy nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'\nI get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once\nMultitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'\nHouse of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches\nDoing features while watching a double feature nigga\nI see you suffering from haterism, get that check\nI take nothin' and make somethin'\nThere's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'\nAin't dealin' with fakes, ain't fuckin' with snakes\nThey all in my face now they got what it takes\nMy nigga I'm straight\nSo don't reach out cause I peaced out\nWhen I reached out, there's no response\nLike knockin' on an empty house\nYeah, so I keep on while you peep on\nWhat I be on and you're behind - that's what karma's about\n\n[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]\nFirst the love was there\nThen the paper came\nThen the haters came\nBut we still rise above\nFirst the love was there\nThen the paper came\nThen the haters came\nBut we still rise above\n\n[Outro: Amber Rose]\nMan what the fuck is wrong with these niggas\nThey rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas\nClaimin' they ballin', to me they playin'\nThese niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'\nMan what the fuck is wrong with these niggas\nThey rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas\nClaimin' they ballin', to me they playin'\nThese niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/33ab790859f8f1a0a8e408ee23962e6c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
