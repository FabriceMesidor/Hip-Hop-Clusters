The baddest woman ever in the heart of South\nProven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt\nPlus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route\nI'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about\n\n[Interlude]\n\n[Drake] I-I, I'm ready for ya\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nYeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter\nGot my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI'm in control but with you bein a man\nYou don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man\nCause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya\n\n[Drake]\nR.I.P. to the girl you used to see\nHer days are over, baby she's over\nI-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya\nI-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man\nCause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d0129f5c63f1ee10f591e6ce8849c5c5.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
