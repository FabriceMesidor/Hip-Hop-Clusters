to ride with Delilah and Nicole in the Fairmount\nI'm who incite the riot, you the guy at the staredown\nI worked at Taco Bell, now I just fire the shell rounds\nNow somewhere in the air lies the truth like a thunderstorm\nI terrorize the youth as if I'm gunnin' for 'em\nI could've jogged here, I marathon the booth and let it run its course\nThe R's here I'm paralyzin' you like the underscore\nYour riders couldn't impress my chauffeurs\nYour favorite artist couldn't benchpress my notebook\nI transcend like Wu-Tang to all eras, cash rules\nNow I'm just dead nice, the pallbearer of bad news\nShouts to all my niggas out there in the locks of crime\nRemember they can lock your body but can't lock your mind\nYou lack triumph when you stop the grind\nYou rappers Blac Chyna, went and got your bread and went and got behind\nGun professor, I'll punch whoever\nCome here lookin' like Conor McGregor\nLeave this bitch lookin' like Uncle Fester\nQuestion, are we bitter rivals?\n'Cause we can shoot the Ks or the fade\n'Til both of our arms get vitiligo\nI stay in my prime, y'all niggas just sippin' on scotch\nI stayed with my nine, y'all niggas just live with your pops\nI sit in the original lyrical pivotal spot\nEven though I changed with the time like digital clocks\nEither goin' straight for the kill\nGun-slingin' or I'm goin' straight up Jada and Will, I come swingin'\nI write for B.I.G. and 2Pac\nI'm rollin' like the prices on the coupe dropped\nI'm dolo like a sniper's on the rooftop\nI'm sicker though, I'm feelin' like the flu shot\nI shit on every artist on the charts and leave a diaper on the jukebox\nMy mind's like the Japan bullet train, it floats in cycles\nRhyme full of pain, spoken right out the smokin' rifle\nThey wanna see me tweetin', \"Yo man, who need a feature?\"\nI'd rather squeeze until the Colt jam like Lisa Lisa\nI'm 5'9\" givin' niggas them 6'9\" fears\nWe can battle like them Grind Time kids\nHow about this, how about I take your wifey on tour with me\nAnd never give her back, same way my nigga Big Sean did\nI go hard 'til 2088, my father was crazy like Hailie Jade\nStill I was born a Saint like Baby Ye\nI prayed hard and only God I fear\nYou just plain playin' God, lookin' like James Harden without his beard\nThese niggas hoes, man it's sickening\nThey only goals is get some golds and bitches and\nGet on the 'Gram wearin' a Roc Nation hat\nBut anybody who's anybody knows\nThe closest they ever came to seeing HOV was....\nBut anybody who's anybody knows\nThe closest they ever came to seeing HOV was bein' witnesses\nSo run along with your little microwave hits\nAll you niggas is my light work like the day shift\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, right now I'm finally respected\nUntil the day that I'm finally neglected\nAnd I'm fallin', I'm callin' all kinds of pyrotechnical fires in the sky over Heaven\nDuring my final eclectic spiral I die, right on the steps\nAs if I don't accept it\nIf it ain't green, I don't see it, I'm color-blind\nWith my eye on the exit, with my other eye on the double line\nOn the essence and any other kind of successes of the grind\nDominoes with destiny I'll forever be fuckin' fly\nI'm fired with flows, top five and you know\nI'm happy at platinum but I was happier\nBack when 500 thousand was sold\nMy proudest accomplishment now\nWas when I got quiet to get sober\nAnd silence is gold\nI let my whole story fly at no cost to the people\nWhile I'm talkin' to Joe, no Budden\nI'm talkin' Joe Walsh from the Eagles\nNo stuntin', we just wrote somethin'\nMy demise was s'posed to be weeks ago, keep your smoke comin'\nI'm over here with 500 styles like a savant\nYou wanna see me washed, 500 pounds like I'm Avant\nHair dyed and all fried up like Yung Joc or Jaheim\nOnly way I'm goin' out is gunshots or sirens\nWe make paper, you party, we play Vegas\nNothin' but sirens surroundin' me when we play wagers\nI'm fuckin' the bitch of my dreams and we they favorite\nMy BMWi green like DeRay Davis\nI be givin' bitches orders like they mothafuckin' grandpa\nTrappin' is for rappers, I be grindin' like the dancehall\nI don't know astrology, I just know I'm a Cancer male\nEatin' south of France, he who doubts the man can't prevail\nBack when Guru used to manifest the rhyme\nI was known for nothin' less than just a candidate for crime\nIn and out of Ibiza, spendin' power, a Visa\nStandin' the test of time like the Leaning Tower of Pisa\nIn my D-zone so the bitches gon' sweat it\nGot the same piece of chrome Sweets loaned Bishop on credit\nGot the Glock Craig used to help out Smokey and Day-Day with\nThe 38 Mad Dog used to pop JJ with\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverybody comin' with their hit record, big record\nThis gon' play in the clubs, radio, chick record\nEither that or they come with a diss record\nI come from where you don't disrespect none of your successors\nI don't fuck hoes that I can't leave in less than six seconds\n\"Who the best?\" is a horrible rhetorical sick question\nYou guessed it, I'm throwin' bullets at you, but you ain't about to go for long\nI'll pull the .44 and let it bang like Post Malone\nMight as well get ready for your tomb, you play me\nTell your wife she gon' be solo soon like Swae Lee\nQuarter pills, recoupin' the deal worth a quarter mil'\nAll I'm tryna do is stay Black and get out like Jordan Peele\nEverybody do it for the accolades, I'm tired of them\nI ain't cared about Grammys since Jay boycotted them\nSpent my first advance at Manny's followin' Pharrell and them\nUsed to ask bitches for ass, now I'm just tellin' them\nIf I get anymore fly, I'ma need my own space suit\nGot these hoes gettin' naked like they high off K2\nAll I need is five minutes, every style get augmented\nWell-endowed, in God's image, never smiled, Kawhi Leonard\nThese pellets of pedophiles comin' out this arm, bro\nThey touchy, trust me, Dudley, Arnold\nMy show start at 12 and it sold out by 11\nRappers blow up, then they debut their whole album on Ellen\n\n[Verse 4]\nAin't nobody fresher than him, that dealt with more pressure than him\nNever dealt with niggas whose image is skinny stretchy denim\nJust remember everyone who with me winners\nEveryone who with you dinner\nBitches switchin' quick as Bruce and Krissy Jenner\nChrome rims on the whip, just to shine on niggas\nBlack tires, the lip white, Tyrone Biggums\nWe givin' out turkeys on Thanksgiving like Nino with us\nWe even passin' out TVs like Wendy Williams\nAll I know is that I'm the wild child\nY'all don't want no smoke with these bars\nAll y'all niggas know is y'all SoundCloud\nLet's hypothetically say I'm pissed\nI would definitely AR grip, I would definitely spray off quick\nY'all expectin' me to hesitate to shoot this bitch\nThen y'all are definitely in the playoffs with JR Smith\nI'll definitely put my hand in your pockets but not the way you want\nI'll put your whole family in boxes like y'all the Brady Bunch\nI go bananas, too miraculous to react to mortal mammals\nCookin' crack in my new velour pajamas\nGettin' back to my roots rap where I store them hammers\nLore the grammar, my IQs my actual quarter-panel\nMy IP address is my dresser drawer\nI ain't stressin' unless it's war, I ain't session, less is more\nI bet you you'll die less of my iron's legend for regrettin' gore\nGhost whiter than the driven snow and it's headed north\nLookin' like it's four of the seven dwarfs, flows and metaphors\nBury skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus\nWhy these niggas gettin' their hair dyed and their nails polished?\nI'm like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big L's body\nI don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments\nSo I'ma go roll a Testarossa down the coast of Monaco\nLo and behold your honorable, niggas is sheep\nNiggas asleep, 'bout as woke as a dinosaur\nMy connect'll give you a whole kilo of coke\nSo he can go Geronimo\nHe should receive a trophy for bein' the Holy\nJesus of flows, he the GOAT\nBaaaaaah, that should be my tag\nI'm from the streets where the odds are not even\nRobbery themin', ball, it's debauchery schemin'\nAllah and Jesus, it's hard to believe\nI'm a product of Eve in the Garden of Eden\nThinkin' how targeted we've been\nRihanna's stalker, I'm parked in her DMs\nShark in the deep end\nPut these paws on you, I'll soften your defense\nHit your pause button, halt your critiquin'\nTalk is cheap, the more I hear you talkin', it cheapens\nAnd all I see is prey 'round the streets today\nI'm 'bout a freak away from havin' Issa Rae eatin' out Lisa Raye\nAny artist out that you see is great\nTell him I said bring his ass, better bring his A\nLet his single play\nWe don't care what you sing\nHit you in your face with the butt of the gun\nYou leak and give your street credit a few streams\nPop go to weasel nigga fever nigga I'm the illest\nYou got pop culture fever, nigga\nAll I know is B.I.G. and Pac quotes\nPop toaster, squeeze the triggers, season tickets\nNow I pull the cops over, give them niggas season tickets\nWifey used to shoot me down vicious, now she the missus\nShe turned me to a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin\nI told myself when I was 14 that she the one\nNow a nigga prolly got more seeds than Peter Gunz\nNow a nigga grow up, my groceries in two-seaters\nUsed to roll the old-school, four speakers and two tweeters\nRidin' with nothin' but raw, quarter packs in duffles\nRyan writes heaters\nY'all niggas is cut like one of them Get Rich or Die Trying wife beaters\nMe, I'm just all shoulder straps and muscle\nIf you're a hater, let's do it\nI'll whip you now then I'll whip on your boy later\nThem whippings'll go around like a tornado\nI get rid of more yayo\nI don't do Rodeo or ayos, I do the Floyd May-o\nSo many men shoppin' in women's section it ain't no ladies left\nYou niggas crazy, yes\nYou playin' crazy like the Chappelle sketch, Wayne Brady ep\nI'm what you get when Freeway Rick and Cocaine '80s met\nI'm bringin' bars back to the street like Jay and Nas beef\nBroadcastin' Ether in HD at godspeed\n\n[Outro]\nPRhyme available 3/16", "image":
