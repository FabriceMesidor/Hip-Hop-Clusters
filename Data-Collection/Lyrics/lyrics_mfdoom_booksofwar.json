(yeahhh!)\nPay ya fares,... give the Herbalizers his shares\nAnd y'all could pay DOOM in beers; cheers!\n\n[Verse 2: RZA]\nI came to the shores of America disguised as a pillar\nThe alpha and omega and the home of the beggars, the black sellers\nWho been beaten, raped, lynched, robbed and stoned\nAnd caused to roam the earth in service cause they couldn't maintain at\nHome\nThis dates back to 1555\nWhen they captured the first tribe of men\nAnd piled them in a pen\nFifty feet high\nThey took em all on a 9000 mile ride\nAnd landed on the shore of a place they never seen before\nBut read about this inside the ancient books of war\nBonded in stainless steel, stripped of their language\nStill survived the anguish of slavery but still remained nameless\nSeparated to portions and tricked by John Haughty Hawkins\nAnd sold on the auction, taught birth control and abortion\nRulers of the first part became slaves of the worst part\nThe devils cursed God and reversed God\nAnd turned God into dog and made people search hard\nNo relief came to the prophet of W.D. Feraud\nTo a trauma, dropped our mommas off in Bahamas and Barbados\nTobagos, separated us from slave boats\nMade our own brothers hate us\nFrom Virgin Isle to Jamaica\nTrinidad, Honduras, Haiti, Grenada\nBermuda to Cayman, mental enslavement\nYou black gods become awaken", "image": "https://images.genius.com/263743633b6e58854e753b25dca6beab.430x430x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
