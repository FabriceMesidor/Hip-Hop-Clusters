I had a father too\nBut he ain\u2019t around so I'mma take it out on you\"\nWe used to say \"I love you,\" now we only think that shit\nIt feels weird that you\u2019re the person I took sink baths with\nStreet took you over, I want my cousin back\nThe world sayin' what you are\nBecause you\u2019re young and black, don\u2019t believe \u2018em\nYou\u2019re still that kid who kept the older boys\nFrom teasin', for some reason\n\n[Hook]\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014we can follow the road\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014no one knows\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014we can follow the road\nThere's a world we can visit if we go outside\nOutside, outside\u2014no one knows\n\n[Outro]\nCan you hear me now?\nCan you hear me now?\nOh, help us Lord\nOh, baby, baby, baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/00196af444633a4108e6dc544358985e.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
