Kids with Hennessy grills, they feel charged\nAnd you know what time it is? It's still Ra's\nWhen I do a show real far they steal cars\nStages of battle field reveal your scars\nTrain hard, cause this is a game with ill squads\nPlay with pain and gain a couple of yards\nAnd if you know the deal, you can deal the cards\nAnd appeal to broads with jobs and OV-E-OD's\nBody parts like buns of steel and spa's\nThen we can kick the blahzay blah, smoke a cigar\nWhile I get ma-na-massage\nI'm comin'\n\n[Instrumental Scratches]\n\"The R\"\n\"Rakim is on the mic\"\n\"I'm the R, the A, to the K-I-M\"\n\"The most popular demand and rap classic\"\n\"If I wasn't then why would I say I am?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nFrom the inner city to the suburbs, the street poet\nThe most jiggiest kid with words, and peeps know it\nThey've read about it and heard, plus TV show it\nSo how do I reserve my swerve? I low pro it\nNow there eager to know just how deep the flow get\nI don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet\nSpit a tech that will effect quicker than Moet\nOr high as anything you smoke yet, go ahead roll it\nAny microphone I hold, my heat blow it\nMy M.O. is make more dough till I can't fold it\nAnything I see or touch, I wanna own it\nDrop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co-ed\nI re-load and she keep the candy coated\nAnd when she know she can't control it\nShe tell me she about to blow at any moment\nWell go ahead baby I can't hold it (I'm comin')\n\n[Instrumental Scratches]\n\"The R\"\n\"Rakim is on the mic\"\n\"I'm the R, the A, to the K-I-M\"\n\"The most popular demand and rap classic\"\n\"If I wasn't then why would I say I am?\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed0fa8170b1ec37192ad4e270a004891.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
