Cole]\nOkay, yo, niggas don't want drama (nah)\nSee they talk proper, but when it comes time to spark\nThey all tryna catch alzheimers\nYou all talking no wack shit\nYou outta get smacked faggot\nI seen harder niggas in drag\nI'm bigger than that\nSo test me, don't even ask about it\nDo the math and count it\nYou ain't got half the talent\nNiggas laugh and doubt it\nBut only 'till my cash is sprouted\nPut up your best track, I'll run laps around it\nYo, I'm coming for death, you running for life\nFuck a gun or a knife\nMy numbers is right\nEnough of this hype\nLet's get to it\nNigga you sick, prove it\nYour style's transparent\nMr. Magoo could look through it\nAnd it's true I'm not a thug, but I handle mines\nAnd grammar wise you analyze, I vandalize\nWhich man standing trying to get branded with death\nFalling off stage with a mic stand on your chest\nYo, take a number\nCause all these niggas thinking they can rumble with the rapist\nSuffer from some sort of brain disorder\nThe rain is pouring now\nNigga check the brain storm\nWon't stop until my name is embroidered on the gravestone\n\n[Hook: ?]\nThe therapist boy you like collab\nA pair of fist lefty\nMr. do right have's\nAnd there's your [?]\nEmbarrassment, how bad too delicate for carelessness\nYou out your element\nSyrhenz (\u00d74)\nYou out your element\nSyrhenz (\u00d74)\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nLoose cannon, when I shoot amateurs\nTruth [?]\nAin't a crew standing can do damage\nThis shit is rock solid\nNiggas bark harder than rottweilers\nI rock polish, I spit top notch\nYou rock bottom\nAssed out, my raps similar to a crack house\nSo dope these niggas take two puffs then pass out\nRelax now, never back down\nWhen the bells rung, cause I serve beef raw but well done\nYou can tell hell where I hail from\nThe reigning champ, main event rhyming\nY'all still in training camp\nFucking with me so you gotta be nice\nBut you got better odds trying to hit the lottery twice\nNucka, stop the nonsense or get knocked unconscious\nThe rhymes I'm designing is monstrous\nMy arsenal bomb shit\nGot the haters loving it now\nWatch my shit hit the ceiling\n'Till it's covered in brown\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nThe therapist leading the pack\nType of cat to ball\nYou call without asking, no bringing it back\nI'm made checking\nPlace your wages and bets\nThe stakes is raising\nIf you ain't gotcha money on me, you brain's defecting\nPains ejecting, whenever my name is mentioned\nThe games is lynching, hang and hitch me\nThis natural instinct\nMore than half you faggots against me\nNow watch as I turn this beat to minced meat\nCase closed, snap souls along with pesos\nMy entire camp play cold, below the waist blows\nNever take no for responses, I'm word boxing\nYou [?] watch as I flip and take the world hostage\n\n[Bridge: J. Cole]\nThe therapist niggas\nYo, you out your element\nWhat the fuck niggas thinking 'bout\nYo, check it, yo\nYou out your element\nYeah niggas, yo you out your element\nWhat the fuck ya'll niggas thinking 'bout\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2cd936e786e1ab454043327d585c7702.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
