I'll be leaving in a second\nSipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions\nAt last, I can relax, looking past all of the action\nA fraction or a fragment of me actually is present\nThe rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house's zenith\nYes, the fence intimidates, it's meant to keep you out (But)\nLet your senses resonate and leap it in a bound ('Cause)\nFreedom isn't found inside a visa or a crown\nAnd even the voice of reason couldn't speak it out loud (But)\nMortals are immortal when their soul has been imported\nTo a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole (Whole)\nThis is the warmest moment of a poet turned heroic\nAs he slowly comes to focus, go ahead and watch me glow\n[Charles Hamilton:]\nRey Mysterio flow, stayin' clear\nOf makeup-smeared hatin' queers, makin' clear this is spiritual\nThough a spirit you owe, church final\nYour funeral in an arena, you searchin' for fire\nOr titles, or tidal waves\nTie the game like a shot from outside when it's 95 to 98\nTo throw slid into you left-side broke (Niggas!)
