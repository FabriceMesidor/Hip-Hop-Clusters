It's the same thing over and over again. Feel me?\n\n[Verse 2: G Herbo]\nHave you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?\nFolly boy, O block, eastside\nWhere it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride\nCan't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?\nNiggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying\nUsed to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign\nI've been out there three days and I got shot at three times\nFelt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine\nI be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind\nI know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up\nBut they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper\nWhere I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major\nSmall crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us\nNo food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit\nSame niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with\nBetter watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit\nHomie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit\nI came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it\nFeds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean\nYou ain't never seen the shit that I seen\n\n[Outro]\nComing inbound, forty six minutes from 355.
