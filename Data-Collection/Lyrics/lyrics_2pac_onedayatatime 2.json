Somebody else should try\nCockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change\nSo I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold\nI'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe\nCommunities in need of people that will lead\nKeep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try\nUntil the day I die, I promise to be wise\nWith my heart open, greed brings only misery\nAway the tragedy, so I stay sucker free\nOnly a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise\nDon't be afraid to try, too many of us die\nFor the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise\nStay focused on the prize, though everybody dies\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWe can only learn to take, our anger and our hate\nControl our mental states, settle down and set it straight\nMaybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes\nBefore we said it, regret it later and let it escalate\n\u2018Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take\nAnd there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate\nTo the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes\nYou think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes\nBut we ain't, its grain to go against\nWith every artist comes the image he portrays\nAnd the picture that he paints\nBut in the midst of all this anger and this angst\nNever once did you heard me say I'm a gangster\nAnd I ain't hear no complaints\nBut I know that I will always continue to grow\nAs long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow\nThere will never be another me, and that I can guarantee\nThat's why the fuck I remain sucker free\nTo this day, the game will never be the same\nNo matter how much fame and success they attain\nThere will never be another me\nAnd no matter what they do, there will never be another you\nYou can search, but you'll never find\nYou can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds\nWe will never die, we are forever alive\n[2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time\n\n[Verse 3: Young Noble]\nDon't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype\nRappers are regular people minus money and lights\nSearchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom\nAll the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest\nThere's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'\nAnd the kids think beef is they only option\nOutlawz born filthy, guilty as charged\nMy memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on\nYou think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns\nAnd when your money is up, that's when your enemies come\nSo if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?\nWe needing a change, the drama remains the same\n\n[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal]\nI spend my whole life fightin' myself\nThat I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help\nAnd hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts\nI'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt\nYeah, that there is a fight in itself\nSo I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself\nNo matter how much I try, stay alive\nI'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride\n\n[Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean]\nHeard frivolous beats, we past that\nI'm tryin' to keep some income coming in\nAnd collect on my ASCAP\nThe rappers in the game ain't changed\nAnd I finally realize that we're not in the same game\nThe hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it\nThem .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it\nThe streets is military, you gotta be a soldier\nGotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers\nThey do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us\nSo we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'\nOne way at a time, keep the faith in your mind\n[2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6257fe15b02c727932e884339c27b0a5.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
