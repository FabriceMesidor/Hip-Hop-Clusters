The Knights is superb with this\nWe lyrical murderers, your nervousness got you shaking like turbulence\nThe game need nourishment, so we came to nourish it\nGive you lames encouragement, just the name get perished quick\nBlack Knights, we far from good samaritans\nKeep the crowd rocking, you keep 'em nodding like heroine\nIn the veins of an addict, disrespect, brains'll get splattered\nYou strained from being subtracted, inflicting pain is a habit\nKilla Cali mentality, rob & sell drugs for a salary\nNiggas can't handle me, bring static like Channel 3\nOn the M-I-C, or on the streets leave you like Can it Be\nYou got served by my first verse, for living in a fantasy\nYessir, like my nigga Pharell, for real\nNiggas get killed, Black Knights, we destroy then build\n\n[Christbearer]\nYeah, I make it all seem so simple\nRock the mic with my quintessential, fundamental\nKilling them off, Christbearer the boss\nThe young Rick Ross on the freeway, yeah\nI see the rats run the relay\nYeah, the judge, the jury, the prosecutor, the DEA\nYeah, Christbearer, he say\nAnd he's an O.G. when he flex it, like it's suppose to be\nThe freestyle champ, keep it amped\nThen, nobody in the camp gets served\nWhen I swerve, Christbearer the king, I bring\nThe, fire, the rain, I touch 'em, insane\nSo psycho, yeah, I'm in the PJ's\nIn the projects, I go, insane\n\n[Rugged Monk]\nMonk spit fact not fiction, my written is too forbidden\nIt be touched, to even bitten, you wack niggas submitting\nSpit darts, rap it so accurate, pierce right through your hollow bones\nGraphic clones, couldn't see me on the microphone\nPen and pad, line for line, bar for bar, you take a choice\nYour courage is flattering, but your need couldn't come close\nTo the Rugged M-O-N-K, vivid lyrical wordplay\nDisplay a chamber of rhymes, you couldn't match on your best day\nI leave that ass wet like a dolphin, laid in a coffin\nCompton's where I come from, and shit happen's often\nWhat you know about a nigga dying, for natural causes\nHe got, hit in his neck, now that's natural for flossing\nEven my girl say I'm stuck in my ways\nEver since back in the days, been thugging, dumping with K's\nAnd I'm still at it, still slinging, word to them crack addicts\nStill acting, still quick to keep the beef cracking\n\n[5 Foot Hyper Sniper]\nMy dosage of murder is a movie\n3000 Miles to Graceland, alotta gun clapping, man\nChicks say Dre Street, the last man, specialist, man\nI represents a crime family, nominated for Grammy's\nBrooklyn Zu, up in the casino, chips like Bingo\nFlights to Reno, my team's 'source' like Benzino\nYou 'supreme', we got 'clientele', more kings in jail\nWe so dangerous, we don't get bail\nJudge wanna, let me rot in the cell\nI got to escape like Alcatraz, I be on the run like Ol' Dirty Bast'\nWith a suitcase full of cash, royalties ever stash\nAnd I got dough from paid shows\nLike uptown, and Tonight at the Apollo\nDre Street, a tough act to follow, jumped out the Silverado\nFuck the fifty talent, ahh, bullets flying through the air\nLike spirals on a football, like it was thrown by Brett Favre\n\n\"Take the sword!\"\n\n[Beretta 9]\nYou should pray that I climb the ladder, instead of waving the wand\nHaving to abracadabra, he is no longer with us\nI couldn't be any gladder, like the kid on Christmas\nWho couldn't be any badder, got everything that I asked for\nIncluding the six shooter, gloves with the hat and mask\nAnd you was giving it up so, no reason to ask\nAnd we be living it up, future, present and past\nA bit of pimp in my strut, make it like I got class\nWine in the wine glass, fine bitch with a fine ass\nAnd her friend too, the evil that men do\nJust cuz I got cash, will I figure I take two\nOr maybe three of those, how we treat them hoes\n\n\"Take the sword!\"\n\t\"The sword?\"\n\"Come on, give me the sword!\"\n\t\"You Wu-Tang...\"\n\n[Interlude: sample]\nOne hundred men co-operate to save ten lives\nAnd ten men save one life and death\nThat has always been the way of the 108 Dragons\n\n[The Reverend William Burk]\nTake your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword\nGive your soul back to the church, son, give it back to the lord\nTake your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword\nGive your soul back to the church, give it back to the lord\nYou playing with them rooks, knights, bishops, kings\nQueens, bishops, knights, rooks\nKnowledge equal pawns, frontlines, jagged hooks\nGold shields, illest crooks for the boldest juks\nWe eating soul food, cooked good, now what's it shook\nIt took for one to see the pork without the pieces on it\nIt takes for one to grab the cross as if it's Jesus on it\nIt take for one to see the poor pit with the preacher's on it\nIt take for one to hear the system with no speakers on it\nAnd still know that it's all there with the features on it\nLike them Cadillacs with woofers and them tweeters on it\nWe in stadiums, the floors and the bleachers want it\nIn high school I even had my women teachers on it\n\n[RZA]\nWe keep diamonds in small packets like sunflower seeds\nWhen my Glock get a cold, it throws a gunpowder sneeze\nAchoo, blow a fever at you non believers\nI bet your cornerback won't intercept the receiver\nOf this hundred meter bullet, trigger pull back when I pull it\nA quarter inch, I clear the whole bench, I clear the whole field\nAnd the building, your boy Bobby Steels been\nTrapped in the projects, playing spades with the pilgrims\nNow I\"m back on O-R, aiyo, pa\nThe Glock goes pop pop, now it's back tok the Alamo\n\n\"I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack, now\nBecause of it...\"\n\"Take the sword!\"\n\t\"The sword?\"\n\"Come on, give me the sword\"\n\n[Outro: sample]\nWhen a man wants to attract the female\nThe best way is to apply a musk perfume\nBut when a man uses a musk perfume\nThere are two important things he must be aware of\nOne; is that he will get the woman he wants\nEven if she woudln't ordinarily succumb to his charms\nThe other is that his own special odor, his body's natural smell\nWill change...\n\tThe very demon of revenge seeks divine guidance?\n\tHaha, do you really think you can absolve yourself from sin?\n\tBy sculpting, stupid little toys?\nWho-ho, now that's some shit you don't see everyday\n\tYou've fallen so far, coward\n\tI've been watching you, can you even raise your sword?\n\tAgainst another, where's the cold blooded killer, you once were\n\tDo you no longer have the stomach to fight?\n\tWill you remain a coward, even as your father suffers?\nOh, now, that just ain't nice\nYou don't have to listen to that shit\n\tAnd you have such a long long way to go\n\tTo save your poor tortured father\n\tI've almost revived his rotten bones\n\tOh he will live again, to feel pain\n\tTo suffer, and you don't even have the number two headband yet\n\tSo I have a few more days, or maybe even weeks\n\tTo enjoy your father's pain\n\tBefore you even have the right to challenge me\nWatch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0050e4b1c52ecca6d63818331b489e2a.683x683x1.jpg"}],
