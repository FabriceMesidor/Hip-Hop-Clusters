Your last joint double copper\nYou gettin' money or your runnin' from the Feds\nAin't nothin' over here but 16 with one in the head\nAnd I solemnly swear\nThat all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year\n\n[Chorus: Jadakiss]\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honies that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honies that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me\n\n[Verse 3: Styles P]\nBefore you think of keepin' me down, heatin' me down\nThe flow like water get deep and you drown\nWith no soul, many niggas roll with no goal\nEven the small gun got a little black hole\nYour destiny is something you can never figure out\nNiggas is never happy 'til there's blood up in your mouth\nThere's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame\nThere's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?\nLive with it got money you better give with it\nMy man had the thug in him did his bid with it\nGet married to the game but never have a kid with it\nAdvice from the wise, slice the pies\nToo many schemes devised when dreams collide\nTeams provide war for the street to absorb\nYou stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor\nOnly a blind thug'll fall in love with a whore\n\n[Break: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nUhh, uhh, uhh\n\n[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nWho the fuck wanna squeeze?\nMy Desert E's make MC's freeze\nYou wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams\nYou still apologizin'\nAnalyzin', my size and your size and\nRealizin', a fist fight would be asinine\nYou just pop wines, I must pop nines\nGenuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece\nYou're shook up, two bricks, every cook up\nWe can hook up, all I see is the future\nDisrespect, I shoot ya\nBy the way, them bricks get flipped weekly\nSold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak\nDie for a dollar, nigga, life ain't sweet\nPlay for keeps, wet shirts with experts on the creep\nOur beef is my fianc\u00e9, about to marry it\nIllegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics\nWhy not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom\nImagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like\nMy first LP, beef with me is unhealthy\nFuck around and get an ulcer, loose your pulse or\nCollapsed lung, look how many gats I brung\nFor them homos, still doin' promos\nBreak both your legs you're movin' slow-mo\nGot shine to glow mo'\nNine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'\n\n[Chorus: Jadakiss]\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honies that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honies that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me\nCan I live 'til my last day?\nHittin' honies that be na-sty\nGettin' money in the fast way\nAnd I only care halfway\nBut I still can't let you pass me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f4413efc6682e8c2cfa7a01117fc8cd5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
