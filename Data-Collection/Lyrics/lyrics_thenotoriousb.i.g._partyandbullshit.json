(Biggie!)\nNiggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)\nIt ain't hard to tell I'm the East Coast overdose\nNigga you scared you're supposed to\nNigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart\nFuck up the party before it even start\nPissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk\nOn some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks\n\n[Hook]\nParty and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit\n\n[Verse 3]\nBitches in the back looking righteous\nIn a tight dress, I think I might just\nHit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun\nAnd have fun with Jamaican rum\nConversation, blunts in rotation\nMy man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and\nWe're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking\nIf money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm\nShe grabbed my arm and said \"Let's leave calm\"\nI'm hitting skins again\nRolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken\nNiggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out\nBlows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out\n\n(Music stops\nIndecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing\nBiggie breaks it up yelling \"Yo, chill, man, chill!\")\n\nCan't we just all get along?\nSo I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn\nGet her pissy drunk off of Dom P\u00e9rignon\nAnd it's on, and I'm gone\nThat's that...\n\n[Hook]\nParty and bullshit, and party ...\n\n[Puffy]\nJunior M.A.F.I.A. like to...\nUptown likes to...\nBad Boy likes to...\nBrooklyn Crew likes to...\n3rd Eye likes to...\nMo Bee likes to...\nWe like to...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51f742a1e8029a8aab9ccf973c564777.483x483x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
