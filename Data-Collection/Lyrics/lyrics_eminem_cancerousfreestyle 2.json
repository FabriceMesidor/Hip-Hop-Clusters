So if I said I never did drugs\nThat would mean I lie and get fucked\nMore than the President does\nHilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert\nI ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)\nMy nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge\nGrabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads\nEvery girl I ever went out with has gone les\nFollow me and do exactly what the song says\nSmoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people\nAnd drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal\nI'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal\nSo I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill\nSome people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill\n\u2018Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill\nBut I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist\nHow the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist\nI get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave\nDie from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave\nMy middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?\nAnd this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
