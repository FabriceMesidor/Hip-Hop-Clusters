Rocking that Fu Manchu\nLearning how to defend like the rest of his crew\nSlap a ninja monkey, learn all types of techniques\nSwing that old stink-tail and watch how it reeks\n\n[Verse 2: Cilvaringz]\nYo Ghost, welcome to the Spartan war room\nWhere the killer bees sleep till it's time for the swarming\nWe skirmish, skunk's like the monks\nOf the Shaolin temple who fight, never run\nIt's fire, water, stone rocks and earth\nFive elements deep like the ox and the bird (you heard)\nBanana swing, flame swords and darts\nBut make sure the kid stay good in the heart\nAnd if by any chance things get adrift\n(Surprise!) Dropped at the whiff\nOf a stink, I'm fighting, six ninja monkeys is easy\nAsk the fox if you do not believe me\nDefeat me? You wilding, resistance\nWe fight old baboon and the dragon, so listen\nTo master, the panda, his grammar is kung fu and tongue fu\nThe way he swing daggers? He loves you\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/227de22e535416c2ec2a6f012f37c9ef.620x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
