MTV Raps\nA nightmare walking in a psychopath's nap\nDefeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab\nGuess who's sneaking in the weed bags\nThat be me with my me ass\nNot tryna be anything but free as\nFlow is so nuts, the track is gettin teabagged\nJust wanna rap nice, that ain't me - tag\nIf you wanna be mean, then you wanna be me bad\nCall it being Pretty Lyrically Swag\nSoulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical\nYou can't understand me nor mimic my miracles\nAll I see is me and I'm a mother lovin' mirror-full\nBein' dope is all in the muscle\nIt's more than just a pause and a chuckle\nI bench press elephants, and bowlin ball juggle\nSo don't be scared to take the Super Lu route\nTop 5 alive and I only got 2 out!\nSchool ya on your history, I tell ya what you 'bout\nFight for all the right things and let the Huey New out\nPharrell, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?\n2 man Big Pun, a 1 man Slaughterhouse\nA 2 album Jay-Z, a 1 nigga Wu-Tang\nYoung and hungry Mos Def, a conscious rappin Lil Wayne\nI don't care for similarities\nCause I'm a pioneer, not a parody\nThese ain't bars, this is barbarity\nSLR... Clarity\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this world I'm so alone\nIn a category all on my own\nCause I tell the world what I want to\nYea I tell the world what I want to\nMan I feel so alone\nThey treat me like an outcast\nCause I tell the world what I want to\nBut you can't tell me what you gon do\n\n[Verse 3]\nHoly Shock and awing cattle prods\nAll up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue\nOf my peers, I ain't doin' numbers like Anbesol\nBut I'm here, and I'm revered\nLyric boy, Based King, Master Chef, All City Chess moves Mickey Donny, Diggy, CRS fool\nCarrera Era, Panamera, F-Tool, Emperor, Free Chilly nigga, FNF RULES!!!\n'Ye, what these niggas talkin' 'bout?\nA Jesus in the desert walking, Dundee walkabout\nA self imposed exile, learn to let the awesome out\nEven if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house\nCause the world is mine, Lupe to the rescue, the world is fine\nWords and lines of mine, I feel. are better than every rap in the world combined!!\nAnd that's how you do it\nE'rything flow, errything fluid\nStupid with the raps, but the raps never stupid\nTrakk on the music, SLR ruthless\nAnd the next whip is that Ferrari cart\nGame over - body parts\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this world I'm so alone\nIn a category all on my own\nCause I tell the world what I want to\nYea I tell the world what I want to\nMan I feel so alone\nThey treat me like an outcast\nCause I tell the world what I want to\nBut you can't tell me what you gon do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/519da23233c0aee9cd94e2ea433cf9d8.320x320x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
