Your bitch let me have that\nAnd I ain't even say shit about your fat ass\nShe chose me, don't get an attitude\nIt really ain't got nuttin to do witchu\nI'ma fuck her - anytime I wanna\nLike a dog, I'mma climb up on her\nShe don't sweat me bout my other broad\nBut you called her on the phone and said I'm just a fraud\nI beat up hoes and I'm a rapist\nThen you told all your homies how I hated\nDamn nigga!  I don't even know you\nI seen you actin like a groupie at a show or two\nI know she knows, the way you lied\nLast time I hated it was 1985\nI was young, caught up with a bad bitch\nI took my time, learned the game, I had to have the shit\n\nDon't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)\nBut what if you ain't no player?\n\nShe said you had a little dick, and can't fuck\nOther niggas fuck her good, but you ain't up\nCan't do that stuff with a freak, can't never be weak\nCause a nigga like me'll put a dick in her cheek\nAnd to the beat, I start humpin on her face\nGrab her by the ears and then give her a taste\nYeah nigga, I fucked her and she's mine now\nYou know I been a dog for a long time now\nBut I ain't gon' fight you for this pretty ho\nYou think somebody player hated, you don't get it though\nJust can't figure it out, and you never will\nYour bitch went out and found her a better deal\nSaid it was cool, kickin it witchu\nBut she has more fun when she's lickin on dude\nI hate to be rude, but you know the rules\nLife is the game nigga - you lose\n\nDon't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)\nBut what if you ain't no player?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/96065abbdb6b1c6563ccc77d191b621b.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
