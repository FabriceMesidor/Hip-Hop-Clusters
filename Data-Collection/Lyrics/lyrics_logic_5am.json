Homie, waddup!\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me bring it back down\nThey think it's a game right now (Yeah)\nBut it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)\nBack where I came from now\nWe gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down\nThey think it's a game right now\nBut it ain't the same right now, know my name right now\nBack where I came from now\nWe gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hope you live a long life hatin'\nNow watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh\nSo successful they probably say I signed with Satan\nBut I got God on my side, always down to ride\nDon't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least\nI'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease\nMatter fact like a geneticist\nThese rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive\nShout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars\nRattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars\nIt's all love, man that shit is ours\nThey never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars\nYeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world\nShout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl\nBut that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa\nI heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though\nKeep it RattPack 'til the beat go\nYou might not get the flow now, let it seep though\nFans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor\nBut we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio\nRacism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant\nMy flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it\nI don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate\nRun quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich\nOut the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant\nDeath before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's\nI rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics\nReverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me bring it back down\nThey think it's a game right now (Yeah)\nBut it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)\nBack where I came from now\nWe gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down\nThey think it's a game right now\nBut it ain't the same right now, know my name right now\nBack where I came from now\nWe gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down\n\n[Ad-Lib: Woman]\nMmmn, I'm thinking...\nOkay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da76d57af3e6ee702af91bac2a18326a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
