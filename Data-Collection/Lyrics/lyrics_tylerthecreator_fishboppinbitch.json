Oh, oh (Cool)\n(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip\nMake her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip\nTyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit\nRound trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket\nFilm clips popping on that Canon\nBusting Ottoman cannons, on the pill\nIs he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)\nWolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)\nI'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon\nThis fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating\n\n[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, ohh (Fish!)\nOh, oh\nOh, ohh\n\n[Bridge: Frank Ocean & (Tyler, The Creator)]\n(Frankie, Frankie)\nNow I'd like to take this time of day\nTo thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)\nLetting the sun shine down on the lake\nWhile I fish your waters\nOoh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters\nHell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)\n'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool\nHe on the loose, yeah (Yeah)\n\n[Outro]\nGot to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait\nWait 'til you see the semen swimming\nBaby, please not half, the whole is great\nMorals? Your body's near that coral reef\nIt was once upon a time you came home with me\nThen the next chapter left you in my teeth\nFill your gills with goo\nGoing deeper than Pacific Ocean\nThis specific motion\nMakes this hammerhead puke\nGot to wear a wetsuit, can\u2019t get seasick\nI love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you\nYou\u2019re fucking wet, fish\n\n[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I met this girl at the club\nAnd I just wanted her to suck my dick\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch\nNow she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot\nUntil we go to another room\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks\nThan them other sluts fuck for, real easy\nCause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy\nI used the welcome mat as a cum rag\nAnd all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she\u2019s a cum bag\nFilled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store\nFour more Dora-looking sluts let me explore\nUntil my cock got sore and started growing cold sores\n\n[Chorus]\nNow she thinks that I like her\nBut all I really wanted was that mouth\nAnd that's 'cause\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch\nNow she text messages me every day\nAnd I don't ever hit that bitch back\nAnd that's because\nShe a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap\nUntil my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped\nFlapping up and down until the cack finally go splat\nNow you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat\nThen you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings\nYou wasn\u2019t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling\nNow shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with\n\n[Interlude]\nNow, now why can't we fuck with this bitch?
