Where's my miracle?\nWhere's my miracle?\n\n[Verse 1: Macklemore]\nIt's been a long night\nI just might wake up on the wrong side\nI tell myself it'll be alright\nSunlight peakin' through the dark sky\nBottle it up, fall in the cut, all out of luck\nDrownin' in this quicksand and I'm swallowin' mud\nI taste temptation and I fall in and out of love\nGrab her hand, taxi cab, in God we trust\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Macklemore]\nYou can wish on all the stars, way up in the galaxy\nThey want you to fall apart, so they can have a piece\nI threw a hundred in a wishing well\nAd then I came back for a refund\nSaid \"all this pressure just might tip the scale\"\nSeen it before, it's just a re-run\nSo keep runnin', ay, I keep runnin'\n\n[Chorus: Dan Caplen]\nMy troubles test me on the daily\nThey say that only God can save me\nI think I'm slowly goin' under\nBut I won't ever tell my brother\nAnd now I wonder where's the good gone?\n'Cause I can't find no miracles 'til I go home\nOh, I wonder where's the good gone?\nNeed to find me some hope\nWhere's my miracle? Where's my miracle?\nWhere's my miracle?\n\n[Verse 2: Macklemore]\nI got some secrets, I got some secrets\nMy palms together, prayin', but I keep on thinkin' 'bout evil\nSnake-bit in blood, and the poison, it ain't leaving\nWanna sabotage everything, one and only enemy\nIf these walls could talk, they'd have a lot of blackmail\nIs karma real or not? I can't tell\nThe Devil complimented me and said \"You dance well\"\nThe praise won't save me, and neither will the fan mail\nI'd be a sinner, but thank God I'm not religious\nAnd I'm addicted, drugs and women, there's no difference\nI know the right, but the wrong is just so tempting\nI've got a phobia, fear of what I'm missing, amen", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5ea668c903da567bb7c9de7dda4c7b81.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Macklemore"}
