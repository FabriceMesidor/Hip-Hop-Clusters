Don't call, I'm busy bitch\nUnless you 'bout your business, I'm tryna get some Benjamins\nNiggas say a lot on their way to the top\nBut you know you're too hot when they kidnap your pops so\nI guess that's sayin' a lot\nBut we ain't sayin' much, we just sendin' them shots, nigga\n\n[Verse 4: Pusha T]\nDeath of a dynasty\nI'm talkin' major, not the minor league\nAnd you the last of a dyin' breed\nFollow caine like a menace to society\nThe richest nigga in the city cosignin' me\nMy shampoo days done showed me the way\nAs I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague\nHow can there be closure when the shooter's still in questionin'?\nYour niggas got rich but when you died them niggas owed you\nAnd everything I see is adding up to what you told me\nI'm ramblin', tryna keep it to myself, I'm scramblin'\nStill hard to hold the tears back\nNever saw what I became, can't get them years back\nDeath before dishonor\n\n[Hook: 2 Chainz]\nLive long enough, it'll happen to you\nLive long\nIt will, it will\nIt will, it will\nLive long enough, it'll happen to you\nLive long\nIt will, it will\nIt will, it will", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/UMG_cvrart_00602537507474_01_RGB72_1500x1500_13UAAIM70647.1200x1200-75.jpg"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
