Do you wanna kick it or what?\nI ain't got time to be frontin', I ain't talkin' 'bout nuttin' Just a little sumpin' sumpin'\nIf you're fine and you won't front\nI don't wanna be your man, but I'll hook you up\n\n[Chorusx2]\n\n[L.V:]\nYes I'm rollin' rollin' rollin'\nYes I'm rollin' with my homies\nYes I'm rollin' rollin' rollin'\nRollin' with my homies... ooohhh....", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97c7ad76ff02c037c47be70bed88d095.650x650x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
