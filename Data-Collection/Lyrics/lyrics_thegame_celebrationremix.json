down with my G's\nLook 'round the crib and then pick up my keys\nHop in the Fo', then go so niggas don't know\nI'm puffin on that reefer\nThat chronic that grow from the trees\nAnd now we smokin, throwin' up B's\nAnd I got Bone Thugs on my team\nYou know we steadily drinkin' that liquor\nWalk off in the club say wassup to my niggas and\nI'm stumbilin' into that hydro\nLook-at-me eyes low with a pyro\nSmokin the same in Indonesia, and Cairo\nI'm back to back in them blunts\nNow where-did-me light go\nBefore I get psycho, lets get high bro\nSitting and choppin' with Krayzie\nStuffin that haze inside-a-me swisha man\nLayzie, Flesh, Wish\nAnd never forgetting my nigga Bizzy and\nAimin' slow on Mr. Ouija\nBetter know who the boss\nYou don't wanna get tossed in the river man,\nEast 99, on the grind, it's feel the same\n(Put the purp in the blunt)\n\n[Verse 2: Wish Bone]\nGot a call from Compton\nCelebratin' real niggas so you know that I'm comin'\nLaced up\nLittle bit of sun, little bit of fun\nThey got love in Compton for Bone\nLittle Hennessy\nA little Cali green\nI'm floatin', chokin'\nI'm gone\nLook for something to poke on\nI'm so high, got my Loc on\nBut I'm so real\nLife is so chill\nI'm a grown man\nNigga, fo' real\nIt's mine (mine)\n'Cause I'm spendin'\nKeep my hustle on so Ima get it\nI'm in my own lane\nNigga pay tolls\nNigga no change, if anything\nBetta have mine\nBefore the party stops\nNigga gun range\nBop, bop, bop\n\n[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]\nWell I'm in the back with a blunt\nSteady get it in\nFirst to the last of the month\nHave 'em coming\nNiggas think I don't smoke weed no mo'\nSmell it, then I say pass the bong\nWe having a celebration\nSo gone I don't even know what the occasion is\nCan't even remember my name and shit\nMan look at what this nigga Game done did\nThis nigga done made me relapse on a weed track\nPut some purp in the blunt 'cause need that,.\nDrink a 40 on my own in the zone\nStill I won't get feedback\nKnow the haters wanna see me\nFor the love, a nigga bustin'\nSo I'm feelin' like I'm runnin' with the devil\nEverybody got the level when a nigga got me ready to roll\nAnd Hydro got me ready to blow\nSplit that swisha\nRoll some mo'\nIf yall niggas ain't know Bone can smoke\nHighly, highly, high\nBut on the lowly, lowly, low\nTell me what they want\nA little bit of Bone\nWith a little bit of Game\nStill the same\nThugs swang\nHaters can hate if they want\nFor me, It's still a wonderful day!!\n\n[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]\nHit 'em off the top like on the block\nIt look like he just seen a ghost\nGot a 100 kids floating around in my hood\nAnd we going for broke\nHit the weed and the blunts, lil bro\nAnd roll up some smoke\nGet 36 of that OG\nIf it's potent, tell 'em run the whole key\nAll my niggas down in the land getting that GWAP\nHustlin', eatin', getting no sleep\nFrom Cleveland to Cali\nWe runnin' man\nWit' Game man\nWe Chiefin' man\nIt's the 1st of tha month and we yawnin'\nThat's my everyday agenda\nRed Strings\nBigger heaters\nFive Thugs-N-Harmony members\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown]\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\n\n[Verse 5: Layzie Bone]\nMy life is a movie\nIt's just like a party\nI wake up and roll up and blow on that Maui\nWow-eee\nEarly in the morning, the room is still cloudy\nAll night long\nMy thugs is just rowdy\nAll we do it for a celebration\nWe celebrate life in the fast lane\nAnd never we hesitate\nOnly we demonstrate\nOriginal cash game\nMix it up with the hash, man\nI might let you hit it\nBut never do ask, man\nThat miracle, lyrical, Mary-jay-wanna my sponsor\nThat's why I don't have pain\nL-Burna gon' have thangs\nMy mission is music\nFoe tha love of tha money\nAlways reppin' that Eazy-E,\nWhat he gave me\nYou can't take that from me,\nB-O-N-E, to the T-H-U-G\nTo the G-A-M-E\nGot the game on lock\nLock, lock, lock, lock\nBut rock it, don't stop\nParty over here\nBetter call the cops, (Cuz it's hot)\nThe buddha keep penetratin'\nWe celebratin'\nReal niggas made it\nNo longer me-need-a-me hair braided\nJust chiefin' in my Wahoo\nFaded, Faded!\n\n[Verse 6: Bizzy Bone]\nWe havin' a celebration\nLove to stay high\nOut of my Khakis\nOut of my Gucci\nAnd I'm gonna roll something, when I roll\nWhen I roll that \"OOOO-WEEE,\" Hey\nLet me put it back\nGotta love that\nPut it out?\nFuck that!\nLittle Henny on the side in the ride\nBetter make it alright\nNot much time lookin' back\nBetter handle my business here\nPuff-Puff, Pass\nAnd my last\nGotta leave a little baggy in the air\nGotta put a little love in the glass\nMy legendary, level-headed peers\nGrab a buckle when I buck 'em with a beer\nSell the doe from the back of the stairs\nThat's when it was Clair, (Clair, clair....)\nBut thanks to Game and this life\nTo keep Hip-Hop alive for the ones alive\nAnd even my niggas that's dead and gone\nEverytime in smoke\nAnd it's like them niggas still live on\nHustlin', I still do it\nCelebrate and elevate your mind\nLittle Bizzy gotta keep it movin'\nEverybody on the 1st still high (high, high, high....)\n\n[Interlude: Game & (Chris Brown)]\nJesus Piece, December 11\nWe celebrating the birth, death\nAnd the resurrection of the Black Jesus\nBut until then...\n(Put the purp in the blunt)\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown]\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high\nWe having a celebration, love to stay high", "image":
