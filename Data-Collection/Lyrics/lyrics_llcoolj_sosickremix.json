My name is L\nFirst of all you a banger, straight up and down\nI'm seein minks on your hangers\nI know your momma told you don't talk to strangers\nThat leads to dangerous situations, but I can't be patient\nYou need communication, appreciation\nRespect for your style instead of talkin all wild\nOne smile, you're daydreamin of walkin the aisle\nIn the waterbed, rollin around in a money pile\nBaby my format is not to be a doormat\nBut I still pull your chair out at the table and all that\nTouch your back softly, whatever it cost me\nTime money or energy, you will remember me\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nGotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone\nCause right now it says that we, can't come to the phone\nAnd I know it makes no sense, cause you walked out the door\nBut it's the only way I hear your voice, anymore\n(It's ridiculous) It's been months, and for some reason I just\n(Can't get over us) And I'm stronger than this\n(Enough is enough) No more walkin 'round with my head down\nI'm so over bein blue, cryin over you; and\n\n[Hook: Ne-Yo]\nI'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears\nSo done with wishin, you were still here\nSaid I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow\nSo why can't I turn off the radio?\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nGotta fix that calender I have, that's marked July 15th\nBecause since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary\nI'm so fed up with my thoughts of you, and your memory\nAnd how every song reminds me of what used to be; that's the reason\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Ne-Yo]\n(Leave me alone) Leave me alone\n(Stupid love songs) Don't make me think about her smile\nOr having my first child\nI'm lettin go, turnin off the radio\n\n[LL Cool J]\nI'mma keep you equipped in all of the best whips\nPay attention to detail, even your lipstick\nGive compliments when your pedicure switch\nWhen we on the mattress, you won't care if I'm rich\nI'll love you deeply, whisper sweetly\nEven when you critique me, you can still reach me\nBeats me why you sweeter than a peach be\nOne bite's enough sugar for the whole night\nYou'll be aight, you rollin with the Elvis of rap\nC'mon, move your pelvis and throw it back\nI know it's forward and it sounds a little blunt\nBut love money respect, whatever, pick what you want\n\n[Ne-Yo] That's the reason\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo] Said\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo] And\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ne-Yo]\nWhy can't I turn off the radio?\n{*scratched: \"To the beat y'all\"*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8f036bc91d1ae759df9acb3ca88e0c5f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
