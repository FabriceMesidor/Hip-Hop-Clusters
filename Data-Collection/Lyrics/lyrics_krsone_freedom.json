I'm no Johnny-Come-Lately\nIt's the people that pays me\nG-O-D is what raised me\nTo think that you could blaze me, you must be more than crazy\nRadio is Fugazi, XM satellite plays me\nCriticism don't faze me, being rich don't amaze me\nThese princely rappers, they gettin' parked like Paisley\nI'm two times the effects like Scoop and Crazy Drazy\nI know that no man out there could save me\nSo I save myself with knowledge of self and [?] that God gave me\nNo coulda shoulda or maybe\nI'm in 2024 with the adult version of your baby\nThe path of life is so wavy, you can not be lazy\nOr mindless like a ship sailing eternal gravy\nThrough hip-hop we speak so plainly\nSo let's unite and sail through life as a navy\n\n[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nAnother day (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nThe only way (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)\n\n[Verse 2: KRS-One]\nAll these people looking at me\nWalking with me, staring at me\nThis is how we work, flash film glaring at me\nLittle children very happy, I'm signing books CDs\nNow I'm signing t-shirts, and yeah my hair stay nappy\nLiving giving advice on living your life\nOh no, you don't have to be stopped\nI'm talking walking working\nInserting energy for certain, not an average person\nTemple of hip-hop to hold the over boulder\nMoney folder for soldier, big up Tony Toker\nI don't bridge or poker, not a sauna soaker but come on over\nLet's make a plan to get free as we can\nCruisin' the span of this land [?] in a new range rover\nGet out the city my friend, they have no pity my friend\nThe way we treat each other is silly, my friend\nWhen you consider the millions of men and women and children\nWe gotta raise the quality of living\n\n[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nAnother day (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nThe only way (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)\n\n[Verse 3: Ishues]\nMusic don't make me, I make it then make it\nMake sense, don't it?\nAnd if it don't, you should spend some more contemplation on it\nMoments of time spent honing my rhymes\nSent from only the divine, my purpose is mine\nAnd mine alone to define despite your prospective vision\nOr skeptic criticism or messed-up definition\nI'm a servant of God, don't ever mistake it\nAnd your fate for all that faking, you can never escape it\nI'm faceless and raceless, my message is ageless\nI'm within all faces the same like with hatred\nThe Matrix was fake but how they make it so tight?\nIt's a Mahalia Jackson, imitations of life\n\n[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nAnother day (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)\nIt's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)\nThe only way (in these times it's gotta be life)\n[?] freedom (yeah, living)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/12162bd5dc20dab4c0cbb67190522d80.500x493x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
