I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84ad5364b68fe10c7405ba894802736d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
