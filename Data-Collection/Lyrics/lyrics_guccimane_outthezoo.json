You don't like it? Kill yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nOut the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo\nThey playing games with me when they know that I'm a fool\nSet it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'ma shoot\nYou nincompoops, so rude-a-poo, you tuti-fruit, you through\nI'm an animal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose\nAnimal, a cannibal, they say I'm on the loose\nGucci Mane La Flare, you prolly seen me on the news\nOut the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c3044784696c19ed089aaba671edea9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
