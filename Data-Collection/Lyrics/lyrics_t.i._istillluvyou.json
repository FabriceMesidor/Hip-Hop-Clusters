Ain't got too much to lose\nKnew I could loose it all but never thought of losin' you\nEleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you\nMeetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92\nYou fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate\nAnd all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late\nHow could I let you go? I thought I knew it all\nWhen you deserved the best and more, you been through it all\nYou think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean\nJust take it to consideration, I was 17\nI'm still the same man, just had a change of plan\nNever ask you back and fuck a wedding band\nBut I still love you\n\nRepeat Chorus 1 w/ ad libs\n\n[Verse 2]\nWent from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you\nOn the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops\nI never even thought, to ask my mom what happened\nJust knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'\nWe never had a chance, we was in different states\nBut all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes\nYou tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough\nYou sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough\nBut it wasn't though, and you wasn't there\nThat's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care\nI know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun\nBut now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son\nI could care less if none of yo other children come\nI'mma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one\nFinally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast\nTryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad\nYou probably never knew, cuz hey, I never said it\nBut pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded\nBut now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now\nBut all I wanted was for you to be proud\nI still love you\n\n[Hook]\nDon't hate me shawty\nIf I ain't told you lately shawty\nI still love you\nNow I only wish that I could\nSee that yo intentions were good\nI still love you\nDon't hate me shawty\nPlease don't hate me shawty\nAy, I still love you\nAnd now I only wish that I could\nSee that yo intentions were good\n(Watch yo boy, shawty)\n\n[Verse 3]\nHow could I criticize my daddy on that last verse\nLookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve\nBut be that as it may, I got some shit to say\nIt's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day\nI got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys\nAnd that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive\nAnd I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs\nTo express whachu deserve, girl you worth the world\nBut I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now\nI'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how\nMe and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off\nBut we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out\nWe had a lot in common, almost the same signs\nSame goals, said thangs at the same time\nBut then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind\nHow could I look her in her eyes and holla \"Dat ain't mine\"\nHer stomach gettin' bigger, and time is gettin' close\nSix, seven, eight, nine months and I ain't told mah folks\nNot just messiah mama, hell, I had told yo granny\nThree kids in two years, baby, daddy panicked\nBut I ain't ashamed of you, I'm more ashamed of me\nIt's not at all yo fault, you'd be better off blamin' me\nBut now I realize, where the problem lies\nForgive me babygirl, I apologize\nAnd I still love you\n\n[Hook] 2X\nDon't hate me shawty\nPlease don't hate me shawty\nCuz I still love you\nNow I only wish that you could\nSee that my intentions were good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ab2d918a9feba95d0153b56bb925499d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
