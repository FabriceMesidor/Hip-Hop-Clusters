I do\nDo you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife\nIn sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer\nFor better or for worse, \u2018til death do you part? I do\nFrom the words of a patriot\nI often fear that the sins in my past\nWill come back to haunt me\nBut the consequences are more than I can bare\nI feel that shit, this piece right here\nIs about what comes with fame\nAnd the struggle to keep family within a family\nI give you, this ring\n\n[Verse 1]\n(This ring)\nGot me a top notch straight hot fox\nWe sought rocks and the ewok slot was caught\nGot dropped two playing hopscotch on the block\nOught not twat plot yo' for hops knot I brought dots (This ring)\nHelp me remain sane, no damn games\nCame from bane to a changed mane\nNo cane thang refrain from gang bang\nSlang a praying brain reigns family fame, then came pain\n(Say hello to Tech N9ne!)\nEverybody wanna be down with a nigga\nWomen get a whiff of the money\nThinking of taking it from me\nThey get up in the club, giving the love\nThrowing the pussy full of liquor and bud\nBooty hopping around up in the mo\nGet to looking around\nEvery ho wanna lick a nigga low\nInfatuated with niggas with dough\nGet 'em in the sack and try to make 'em let it go (Tech N9ne)\nBe autographing bitches in front of rapping niggas\nWho think of having figures they get to grabbing triggas\nThey can't imagine villains when they come back and get us\nWe get to whacking niggas\nI ain't never wanted no parts of this\nI don't never want to break another heart for this\nWhy the devil gotta make it, why the Lord\nWanna make something that'll kill something so marvelous\n\n[Hook]\n(This ring)\nBrings demeaning demons in (G-strings)\nSongs we sing make 'em fiend semen and (Green things)\nClinging, dreaming, thinking of being (Mrs. thing)\nWith this ring\nBut if I wasn't Tech N9ne\nBitches wouldn't even wanna be with Tech N9ne\nIf I did no music then would you respect mine\nThis wedding band and music\nDraws a line between life and Tech N9ne\n\n[Verse 2]\n(This ring)\nWas supposed to protect a nigga, best for niggas\nWho couldn't stop having sex with bitches\nBless the missus, who stress to kiss us\nEven though we spend our checks with strippers\nObsessed with clitorises (This ring)\nMade a nigga feel macho\nCry for, lie for, die for, my ho\nNigga I go face diablo with a hostile gospel\nIf I can't have tres or cuatro, little vatos\nI'ma let a lot flow what they sell, up in osco, up a nostril\n(That sound like Tech N9ne)\nNigga where the weed where the\nMuthafukin' blow and the hoes?
