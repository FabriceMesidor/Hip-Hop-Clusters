Chinchilla\"\n'Cause he had the chinchilla and shit\nReal, you know what I'm sayin'?\nThis that Super Future, Fire Marshall Future\nFuture Hendrix, you know the Wizard\nYou understand me? Yah dig?\nYah dig what I'm sayin', man?\n\n[Chorus]\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything\nYou know I hardly forget anything\n\n[Verse 1]\nGutta nigga 'til the dirt\nMargiela my fur\nI was overdosin' on Perc's\nWakin' up, drinkin' that syrup\nBentley Spur with the curtains\nBalenciagas, my proteges\nI wear them shits like Michael Js\nWash the molly down with champagne\nWash the xanny down with syrup, yeah\nHope it take away all this damn pain\nHope it take away all this damn pain\n\n[Chorus]\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything\nYou know I hardly forget anything\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrack in the bushes\nI'm tryna buy me a new 88 Cutlass Supreme\nEvery day hustlin', I gotta go get it\nI gotta get Wu-Tang, man, gotta get cream\nLong as they print it, my niggas, gon' get it\nAll of my love, I gave it to my city\nAll of that game you gave me, can't forget it\nAll that finessin' you gave me, ain't forget it\nI turned the whole world up\nNow they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'\nThese niggas so broke, instead of go and get it\nThey'd rather go ask for somethin'\nRemember them days I had to load it up\nAnd put on my mask for somethin'\nRemember we juuged for somethin'\nRemember we take for somethin'\nI spent three stacks on these Rick Owens\nI try my best to forget it\nI pour my life inside these poems\nMy whole soul and my spirit\nI'm easily agitated, get intoxicated\nTry to fight the demons\nTryna find right and my wrong\nHope my legacy live on\nHope my legacy live on\nThat's why I wrote this song\nI ain't have to write this song\nFuture Hendrix is forever\n\n[Chorus]\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, hardly\nHardly, hardly, hardly, hardly, forget anything\nYou know I hardly forget anything", "image": "https://images.genius.com/adc81ddb71fc3b8fc301fb13d3cb2324.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
