(You ever watch a dream manifest? ...)\nReal life\nIt's nothing like it (It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it)\nDC2\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you ain\u2019t got a dream, you ain\u2019t got nothing\nA lot of niggas changed on me when I got money\nSaid it came with the game, and this what I wanted\nSo I\u2019ma hustle like the first time I got fronted\nFor the love of the green and the love of the team\nPut together a circle that couldn\u2019t come in between\nWent from lint in my pockets to using money machines\nI got my city back popping and they don\u2019t want me to leave\nNo they don\u2019t want me to leave\nBut I gotta go and get it though\nTime is money and I\u2019m on a mission though\nPapi gotta eat, niggas shooting right around my mama way\nCops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way\nTryna touch a million dollars and I\u2019m like a dime away\nNever ask a nigga for a handout, I would grind away\nWrite my little raps, smoke my little weed\nSold a little crack just to fund my little needs\nI was sixteen getting on my little knees\nAsking the lord please help me get a little cheese\nIt was hard out (Hard out), same time it was yard out\nIn the jungle where niggas will rip your heart out\nCold summers where niggas\u2019ll probably starve out\nWanna be a kingpin from watching niggas ball out\nCould you blame us, they was tryna chain us\nBut we was tryna fix the roof leak when it was raining\nWe was tryna keep the house warm when winter came in\nBut they rather detain us, locked us in cells with strangers to raise us\nAnimals go in cages\nThat\u2019s what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us (They slaved us...)\n\n[Chorus]\nSmall city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)\nSince I was sixteen (Sixteen)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)\n\nSmall city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)\nSince I was sixteen (Sixteen)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen\n\n[Verse 2]\nR.O.C. man told us \u201cSun don\u2019t shine\u201d\nYou know if his daddy hustling then his son gon\u2019 grind\nHis father was locked up, now his son doing time\nWhen certain niggas get to starving, know that gun gon\u2019 shine\nTwo felonies on his record, he got one more time\nGet an app, picture that, he don\u2019t want no job\nLost hope, some niggas don\u2019t even want no God\nThey just want a little money just to come through fly\n\u2018Cause nobody never listens to the broke nigga\n\u2018Cause when you broke, you considered as a joke nigga\nIf you a joke, you considered as a ho nigga\nAnd no nigga wanna live life living poor nigga\n\nSmall city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)\nI been waiting for this day since I was sixteen\nSelling white girl, I\u2019m talking Christine\nYoung boy with dreams of touching that big screen (Big screen)\n\n[Chorus]\nSmall city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)\nSince I was sixteen (Sixteen)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)\n\nSmall city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)\nSince I was sixteen (Sixteen)\nI been waiting on this day since I was sixteen", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7bc28c05034136e861be4c94601d20a.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
