I made chickens cross the road\nLay the mack down, run this pimpin' 'cross your hoes\nPick the mack up, you sponging stitching up your hoes\nFlip your Lac truck\nYou're running tripping over your clothes\nI'ma seize ya, I'll make you a believer\nYou the type to get charged like Visas\nGet in the bing and sing like divas\nBuck shots leave your face looking like receivers\nStay on my op, stay on the block, and stay on the top\nLike freezers, I'm over the wall\nRunning from blood hounds and retrievers\nI don't like you and I don't fuck with him either, so give me three meters\nI bang nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b67b7f5bfbd7eb8c5c334fa8b05a2432.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
