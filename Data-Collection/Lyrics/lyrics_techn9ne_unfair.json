Thidis war, you're nada when it pours!\nWanna pla-ay every da-ay, sta-ay for the wa-ay that I spra-ay\nSa-ay? You got the pa-ay? That's ya-ay or na-ay?\nBumblebee tuna, grrr\nDon't be smelling like it if you're under me, rumors\nWill begin about you from hung-r-y pooner's!\nHopin', wishin', prayin' when you're gone it'd be sooner!\nWhen I'm dead I'ma get up in the head of the nigga that set it up pickin' the lead up, then I wet 'em up look like a predator\nI'ma dead 'em and let it puss, skip the peace it ain't no humble we Luna\nMoon stricken, rednecks sayin' who them coones rippin'\n(Boom!) Pick 'em off\nTake 'em off to my land in my van a lotta room, get in nin nin\nWhen I catch my flow try to wake up your style\nBut you fucked up like, \"Uh-oh, I'ma make up for it now\"\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nIt's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity\nBeware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody\nOf this clarity, we bare that we share, swear we need therapy\nPrepare to see nare any spared caring is bare-ly there\nIt's unfair to be such a motherfucking rarity\nBeware that we tear many squares if he dares to be a parody\nOf this clarity, we bare that we share, swear we need therapy\nPrepare to see nare any spared caring is bare-ly there it's unfair\n\n[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]\nWho are these dudes?
