Mean]\nNow as I stand here, a man here\nNot a perfect one, but a searching one\nSeek in another, blazing time\nSound crazy but I'm actually tryin to escape my mind\nTryna rise in time\nBut hoping that you didn't notice\nWhen I was at my low as\nSo I knew they were watching, I couldn't stop it\nSo many things I wanted to accomplish\nToo many dreams, wasted with no promise\nFrom out the darkness I struggle to see the light\nRumble deep in the night\nHustlin with all of my might\nSome won't see it that way\nBut us is given praise\nBut all of them will dream\nThat I did it my way\nIn the event of my demise\n\n[Verse 4: Kastro]\nI was born to a storm that won't lead up\nAnd I was rased to stay brave with my head up\nBut thing ain't got better\nWe still gettin wetter in this bad weather\nI need more than a sweater and a leather\nYo, ain't nothin ment to last forever\nSo the stuggling and the suffering ain't gon' last forever\nAnd my will, probably be like two lines long\nIt will read I'm dead but my soul lives on\nAnd my spirit still living though my body is gone\nIn the event of my demise I love all who stay strong\nI love all who stay strong\nIn the event of my demise, com'on\n\n[Outro: Geronimo Ji Jaga]\nIn the event of my demise\nWhen my heart can beat no more\nI hope I die for a princeple\nOr a belief that I have lived for\nI will die before my time\nBeacause I feel the shadow's depth\nSo much I wanted to acomplish\nBefore I reached my death\nI have to come to grips with the possibility\nAnd wiped the last tear from my eyes\nI loved all who were positive\nIn the event of my demise", "image": "https://images.genius.com/866e68770deafd17a70d2918c7819b81.817x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
