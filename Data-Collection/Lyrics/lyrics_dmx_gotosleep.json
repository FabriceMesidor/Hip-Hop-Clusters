Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...\n...Go to sleep bitch!\n\nWe got you niggas, nervous\nOn purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless\nYou'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please\nYou'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third\nYou'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?\nWhen lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when\nYou fuck with a label overseeing the Earth\nShady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth\nAnd as I mold, I become a curse\nSo we can put down the verse, take it to the turf\nCock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who\nDepicts fiction in his verse\nAnd as I breathe, and you be deceased\nThe world believe you deceived just to speak\nYou'se not the streets, you'se the desk\nUse not your chest nigga, use a vest\nBefore two's choose ya rest, you chose death\nSix feet deep, nigga, that's the debt\n\nNow go to sleep bitch!\nDie, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes\nGo to sleep, bitch! (what?)\nWhy are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?\nAnd go to sleep bitch! (what?)\nDie motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!\nGo to sleep bitch! (what?)\nWhy are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah...\n...Go to sleep bitch!\n\nHey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets\nI'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat\nStalk on the beat, walk wit my feet\nUnderstand my pain, the rain ain't sleet\nPeep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going\nShit don't seep, then sleep not knowin\nBut I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life\nEasy-going with the same one that started the fight\nHe be knowing how dog get, when dog gon bite\nTried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life\nGrand champ, and my Blood Line is tight\nCuz it's all good, it's all right\nNiggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back\nNow they gots to swallow, everything in the sac\nBlood Line, and, we can go track for track\nDamn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?\n\nNow go to sleep bitch!\nDie, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes\nGo to sleep, bitch! (what?)\nWhy are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?\nAnd go to sleep bitch!
