You're the real leaders of the people. The rapper doesn't think he's a leader, but he's got followers all over the world. The biggest preachers don't have as many followers as one rapper\n\n[Verse 2]\nI represent war, pain, destroyed fame, contort cane\nChess playing rather than board games\nSavages saddling up, grabbing the horse range\nDragging emcees traveling eating like Bourdain\nThe congregation asking me how I be preaching so accurately\nI answer it's actually easy, I'm ordained\nThe name is Luther Campbell, you can call me Luke though\nStanding for what I'm saying like Farrakhan on Donahue's show\nNow they trying to find a loop hole\nThe silence my words, the knowledge I speak\nIs a reflection of the violence I see\nNow the perception's your daughters and nephews idolize me\nNow the objective is call me highly aggressive instead of just successful\nCause my rhetoric highly suggestive\nProbably connecting cause it's honest, refreshing\nOnly way I'm trying express it\nDown to die tonight\nGrabbing his gun and shit like a young Malcolm\nThat'll get me capital punishment like the Pun album\n\n[Interlude 2]\nSo is the question now how can we get you to rap where intelligence is coming through the lyrics with a beat that begins to open the minds of people. Our people want better. And they'll do better if they're shown better", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2627cc5445030d64606928667383564b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
