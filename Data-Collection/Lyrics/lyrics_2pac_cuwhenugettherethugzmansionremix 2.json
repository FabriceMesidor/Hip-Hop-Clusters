Where do niggas go when we die?\nAin't no heaven for a thug nigga\nThat's why we go to thug mansion\nThat's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G\n... at thug mansion\n\n[Verse 1]\nA place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind\nSo much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times\nI once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried\nBut when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes\nNo one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble\nNot knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you\nPicture me inside the misery of poverty\nNo man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\nPrayin hard for better days, promise to hold on\nMe and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on\nWe found a family spot to kick it\nWhere we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit\nA spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's\nWe still visualize places, that we can roll in peace\nAnd in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast\nI got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion\n\n[Hook}\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\nI'll see you when you get there\nIf you ever get there\nSee you when you get there\n\n[Verse 2]\nWill I survive all the fights and the darkness?\nTrouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed\nI shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good\nFor multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots\nNobody cares, seen the politicians ban us\nThey'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain\nWhy they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?\nOr am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?\nI need a place to rest my head\nWith the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead\nIs there a spot for us to roll, if you find it\nI'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go\nHow can I be peaceful? I'm coming from the bottom\nWatch my daddy scream, \"Peace,\" while the other man shot him\nI need a house that's full of love when I need to escape\nThe deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good\nTell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came\nLittle Latasha sho' grown\nTell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand only God can save us\nWhen Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist, together\nThere has to be a place better than this, in heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin\nRemember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion\n\n[Hook 2x]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
