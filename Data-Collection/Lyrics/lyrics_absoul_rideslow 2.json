Put that away, no weapons formed against\nMe shall pass, remember that? I'm biblical with this shit\nThe tales from the Crip, on the soul of Sunday schools finna flip\nOh!

While I was sipping Actavis\nFast life, slow motion in my double cup\nThe screw give me drive like a flat-head, every fill up\nI must be Captain Phillips, these niggas don't speak my language\nResidue on my debit card, don't tell my moms\nThat it's a lot more than marijuana in her son\nI walk on the dark side, only to shed light where they ain't no sun\nDeadline snapback on my mind, I ain't suicidal, I'm just fly\nMy rhymes Ciroc and Ayahuasca, would you like a sip?\nEnlightenment from a low life that's more than likely high\nWhat I do with eight zips nigga? You don't know the half\nAll these lines add up like a motherfucking graph\nRap as if I had two left feet, tryna walk a righteous path\nSo here's a question that I ask\nWhat's a negative with no plus? A Benz with no bus?\nA curse with no gift? Who's God with no us?\n\n[Verse 5: Delusional Thomas]\nDelusional, murder marsupials when I puke a flow\nPut my dick in witches from \"The Crucible\"\nI'm hard to get a read on, that pussy shakin, Parkinson's Disease on\nPardon me, I sneezed, blessing conscious as it speaks freely\nDeath is cold homie, breathe easy, loaded gun in front of me\nShoot the soul right out of Soul, yeah you my homie\nYou do my murder and\n\n[Interlude: Ab-Soul & Delusional Thomas]\nAy-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (fuck off!)\nRelax, relax my nigga (Maaaaaan!)\nCalm down my mom listens to this shit, bruh (I ride slow)\nYou need to stop sniffing that goddamn bleach is what you need to do\n\n[Verse 6: Delusional Thomas & Ab-Soul]\nWell how dare a man talk about the potency of my pack?\nI snort dope that's mixed with crystal meth and gastric bypass\nSatan's blood in my flesh, nobody is high as\nAnd these days the iPad\nWill tell you that your life will be no longer than an eyelash\nAnd then float away (I ride slow) so good luck\n\n[Outro: Delusional Thomas]\nBoop boop boop boop boop boop!
