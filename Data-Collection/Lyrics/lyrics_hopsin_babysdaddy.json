What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite\nYou got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like\nA broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish\nSteady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish\nJesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!\nThat's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with! (What?!)\nI knew this would happen without a question\nBut you said, \"I never have sex without protection\"\nBitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek\nYou sex driven like a big freak\nPlus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap\nAnd rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me\nAnd now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide\nLike, \"Sure, I'll take care of the little guy\"\nShit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress\nI put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm far from a fuckin' life saver\nNot you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor\nIt's not my issue, take me off the menu\nI'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you\nI'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul\nBut I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)\nSee you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you\u2019re it\nToo bad his dick didn't have any insurance\nYou knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it\nNow your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it\nHoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid\nThat's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined\nAnd don't be callin' me like, \"My life's a crazy blur\nRashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt\nI wish that me and you could go back to the way we were\"\nShit we can, just get rid of the baby first\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Bridge]\nNow I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one\nBut you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum\nAnd if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean\nBut don't ever send the baby to find me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo\nDo you remember when I told you I would love you forever\nAnd broke up with my girlfriend Heather\nKicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' you were better\nAnd found out you were a heart shredder\nYeah, I felt really stupid after that\nBecame the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact\n(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list\nSo ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch\n\n[Chorus]\nMarcus? What? Will you be my baby daddy\nAnd be the one to always make me happy? Ho, hell no!\nWill you watch SpongeBob with him\nAnd then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty? Ho, hell no!\nEven though I got stretch marks\nWould you still be down to get nasty? Ho, hell no!\nShit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows\nPlease? No! Please? No!\n\n[Outro]\nHey, that's life\nYou fuck me over\nHe fucked you, you got pregnant\nNow you're fucked\nYou had me\nYou had me, that's the funny thing about it\nAnd you blew it\nHa ha ha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/511235d7620c5ca1e6b46a485cb180d6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
