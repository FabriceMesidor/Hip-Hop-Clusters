How's it feel with your broken heart?\nCan't reveal, can't reveal all these fucking scars\nHurt me now, kill the pain, this is just the start\nKill me now, numb the pain, I just want it to stop\nRun away, run away from my broken heart\nKill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start\nRun away, run away from my broken heart\nKill me now, numb the pain, this is just the start\nHeart broken, no one can feel me\nHeart open, with an incision\nYou broke it, too many faces running\nI'm nothing, I'm nothing different", "image": "https://images.genius.com/262927a9bc40574784114d10d6540e36.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "XXXTENTACION"}
