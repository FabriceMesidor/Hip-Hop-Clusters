Mom come to L.A., I'll get you a jet\nGot off my ass and I got to a check\nFeelin' sorry for the niggas who slept\nYeah, on me and my gang, cause we runnin' shit this year\nFuck a phone, I'm gon' hold them hundreds to my ears, aye\n\n[Chorus]\nI miss ridin' round town with my friends\n.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun\nCooler then the boys in the band\nColor in my dreadlocks, choker on me, headlock\nGood days, good days, reminisce the good days\nClose my eyes, I tell myself it's okay\nGood days, good days, reminisce the good days\nClose my eyes, I tell myself it's okay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
