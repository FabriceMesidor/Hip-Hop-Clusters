spoon in your mouth, so don\u2019t critique\nLook at me nigga, just a young hood nigga, tryna get this cake\nI don\u2019t need to be givin\u2019 out how school gon\u2019 educate\nFilet mignon for my food stamps, I know mama credit quite good\nSo I\u2019m out here with this dope money, got a big body in my hood\nNigga you see it, better believe it, this what I\u2019m 'bout\nGot a trap house that

my food stamps\nWould tell you I don\u2019t but it won't be the truth\nLet me hit you back on my government phone\nStill a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?\nWe get a blunt and a joint out a sawbuck and loud\nWhere I\u2019m from we be actually hoopin\u2019 in Jordans\nFive dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes\nAin\u2019t nobody finna do shit important\nPeople really don\u2019t give no fuck about nothing\nAlthough they may smile and be cordial\nDealin\u2019 around with the wrong damn crowd\nThen bring a frown to my friend, I'm in an alley, we warned you\nBackground check for the chopper\nThe barrel breathin' back down the neck of imposters\nThe murder rate ain\u2019t back down yet\nCause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin\u2019\nSome people, listen\nYou could be predisposed or be preconditioned\nOr speak with the preacher, been preaching, be the person\nTo put some process in your progress or be the prevention\nI just live my life and I don\u2019t stop grindin' until God tell me to\nI get money, I ain\u2019t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?\nThey say my kind ain\u2019t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that\nBut those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them\nIt's still a fact\nSo mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine\nYou\u2019ll solve you'll find that this is\nBest for everyone involved, all in all, the Lord my witness\n\n[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]\nYeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)\nCar cosigned by my mama (mama)\nMedical card from Obama ('bama)\nBackground

Trouble]\nPermit, don\u2019t need permission from a doctor\nI been smokin\u2019 since a pre-teen toddler\nI been servin\u2019 since a jit, tryna dodge all the obstacles\nMy teachers all told me that were probable\nProbable cause, no cracker never really had it\nI was just a nigga in a high price whip\nYeah, I\u2019m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto\nWhere you better have extension on the clip\nWell beef comes around in the town\nMore often than these bitches' emotions\nI got a yopper, five dollars, off the streets (yeah I'm totin')\nFor protection more than anything though (you gon' test my devotion)\nMy first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken\nChicago violence boostin\u2019 up but we just focusin\u2019\nOn other environments cause the country taking notice\nMore fiends are risin', molly the new dope\nAnd I apologize cause it was something I was promotin\u2019\nChopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up\nYou just tell them it was stolen\nRich gunplay, shit that\u2019s all they see, that\u2019s all they know\nWithout it kinda hopeless\nSaid this in \u201909 and still no medicare for grandma\nI done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna\nLu probably tell me, \"Trouble, you gotta put the mac down\nFelonies all in your background\"\nSaid this in \u201909 and still no medicare for grandma\nI done said all

medical shit from that block street\nNigga healthcare insured by that guap\nDoorways ain't hiding me, no stop\nJackers playin\u2019 open season with they yop\nShit I probably be the same, I find drama\nLaw's out lookin\u2019 for me like Osama\nI don\u2019t wanna do no bid, Your Honor\nStill waitin\u2019 on my one phone call from Obama\nTell \u2018em I need the chopper, they tellin\u2019 me I'm a felon\nI'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '9-7\nAnd I'm well acquainted with hell but I\u2019m tryna make it to heaven\nBut they don\u2019t want me to make it, that\u2019s why the niggas be tellin'\nIf I don\u2019t get the chopper, I\u2019ma probably run up inside\nThey better gimme a answer, I\u2019m tryna be cool\nIf I don\u2019t get it then everybody gon\u2019 fear
