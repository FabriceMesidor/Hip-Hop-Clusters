But you still wanna know but I already done did it\nI ball heavy, the physics\nIt's all, but it's already specific\nIf we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific\nThat's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that\nAs an extra exhibit to what's already within it\nThe galleries lack the wall space\nSo I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space\nIf it was more small, it would be Moore's Law\nFrom the land of the po' where we war, saw\nFrom the hand of a pro to a whore jaw\nMake her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw\nWent from paper boy to editor\nFrom throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer\nOn the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers\nOne of several sects who can come and charm the predators\nWe who measure the measuring tools of measurers\nWe who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers\nWe who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers\nWe who question the treasured rules of leveragers\nBorn to death, born to die\nMourn correct: immortalize\nIn a war, where your performance score is your salary\nIt's like fantasies combating your mortality\nI'm just trying to restore sanity\nSigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity\nTo instill what kills krill destroys manatee\nSo heels spill but still seal deals that build factories\nWhat looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees\nNever just trust off guts, but what's actually\nUnless it's Kuato's\nNow, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes\nIn hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes\nA seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads\nNow, that's another strata but I was making sense\nThen cop out, took the highway and I was making chips\nA nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks\nCan fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6\nThis rehabilitation, I be taking trips\n\"Don't Ruin Us\" God said, I won't make a dent\nHardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense\nDevil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff\nIn the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs\nTo make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips\nI'm just trying to redeem\nWith these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean\nTo unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing\nDon't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams\nSamurais rarely die from another sword\nThis is 1985 meets the hover board\nThat was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore\nThink deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards\nDiptych, so now them paintings plural, but this is Jr's Mural", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86aa1a0cb9e9a473ce83eb531fa78079.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
