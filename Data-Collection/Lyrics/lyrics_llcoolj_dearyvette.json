I seen ya comin' out the men's bathroom\nYou wasn't in there alone, wasn't usin' the phone\nThe door was locked for twenty minutes, all I heard was \"Moan\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't really know if the story is so\nI can either ask Curly, or Larry or Moe\nOr Earl, Shabazz, Lou, Mookie or Joe\nLike Santa Claus said, you're a ho-ho-ho\nIn every disco you say hello\nLike you're a little angel, but we all know\nSince you was eleven you been actin' this way\nYou always got in bed when you wanted to play\nYou're a freak, you think you're Lady Godiva\nSome freaks are live, but Yvette you're liver\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou're a back-seat queen, a elevator pro\nA high-powered body makes your Levis grow\nSee the stories I've heard, they could amaze\nI heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days\nSo calm down freak, get a G.E.D\nThat's a General Education on Decency\nOne day you'll see, and agree with me\nUnless you're gonna be a freak until you're 93\nFor you there's no fee, everything is free\nThis is from me to you, not you to me\nEvery night is your night, your leather pants are tight\nYou try to shake your butt with all your might\nI don't really wanna dis nobody\nYou might think I had a little too much Bacardi\nBut that's not the problem, the problem's Yvette\nHow bad can a girl's reputation get?\nSee she's the kinda girl all the homeboys met\nIf you're desperate ask Yvette, cuz she'll say \"Bet\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\n\n[Verse 5]\nB-Boys are hard on the boulevard\nThe Reverend at the church said you was barred\nHomeboys on the block love you a lot\nYou're a real famous freak whether you like it or not\nSo before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin'\nLet me explain to you who is talkin'\nI'm L.L. Cool J from around the way\nYou boogie down to my records almost every day\nGo a hundred miles an hour when you're standin' still\nYou're faster than my Caddy when it's goin' downhill\nWon't forget that day in the Y.M.C.A\nThe guy at the desk said it was OK\nFor you to come inside cuz he knew you'd stay\nGreg G. and Garfield yelled \"Hooray\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette\nDear Yvette", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cde9792f845cc4a69fd337bcff0683b5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
