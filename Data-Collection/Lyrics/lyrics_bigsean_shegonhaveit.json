Do we gotta get Maury involved with it?\"\n\"How many niggas you think that I done had all in it? Stupid nigga\"\nI don't even know why I'm sayin shit\nI hate to be on that all-nigga's-the-same shit\nBut shit I'm saying girl it is what it is\nWe talking kids with a kid and a crib with a crib\nBut I ain't tryin' to leave believe\nI would be a good dad just like my dad was to me\nAnd I can't tell you to kill that shit my mom had me\nAnd I can't tell you to keep a shit we ain't ready\nNow I gotta tell my family to pull up a seat\nCause I planted a seed and about to extend the family tree\nAnd we so stressed out that I called a weed man\nCause I prolly gotta bout a whole family tree\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean (Common)]\nGranny called my mom sayin' I have demons\nI heard my parents talkin' in the next bed\n(To raise Sean we damn near had to give a left leg\nWhat the hell they teachin' these kids in sex ed?)\nEverything that I forgot while getting the best head\nI know couples who took classes cause they couldn't\nI know ball players who pay strippers so they wouldn't\nWhat really make me feel like I ain't shit\nIs that I still gotta tell my main chick\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nFuck, there go our little secret\nShe gon' have it\nShe gon' keep it\n9 months later shit we gon' see it\nDamn, aww shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1db10915bf07ae763610bb53d1717887.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
