Cole talkin' 'bout false prophets\nBut didn't mention higher-ups\nChange your name to Amber Cole\nThese fucking entertainers is playing it by the rules\nSucking government dick for safety to stay cool\nI'm absolutely disgusted by all of you motherfuckers\nTie your throat to a truck, better pedal the metal quickly", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e373a228438b1db2d3bad4637abf6e2f.617x617x1.jpg"}], "artist": "XXXTENTACION"}
