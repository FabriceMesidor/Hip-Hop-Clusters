watch me swell a bigga nigga, baby pa\nUpon the passages the man with massive repertoire\nThe New York undercover Tri-borough representative\nBe ever thorough in takin' niggas out like the editor\nI put it down pickin' it up to get ya open\nI'm the lesson niggas testin' be like destined\nTo be broken down, like matter\nA fact I pimp it fatter than them\nOr any other nigga talkin' that I be wack\nCome now, son how the fuck you thought I would avoid\nFuck that star shit, niggas get their ass-teroid\nMy motion opens eyes like the coast and I co-host\nYour roast, smokin' fuckin' phills with your coast, bitch\nI put clowns in big shoes on the stage\nYou niggas don't know, had better vibe like a page\nDon't switch and watch me catch you like no other can\nDres bitch I'm in the fuckin' house like Bruh Man, and yo\n[Dres, Twista:]\nFuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nDres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nLike a missile, we geek and seek style that takes flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nCatch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\n[Twista:]\nI embrace the mic like a axe when I hear tracks\nReact on victims with vengeance, hostile is my attack\nA spittin' image of death when it comes to microphone battles\nIllustrate fate with hate, creepin' on M.C.'s like shadows\nMurder provokin' mics I'm smokin' like fat weed all day\nNo concept 'cause I be fresh from out that town called K\nM.C. death increases, cut 'er up so you can pick up the pieces\nKill off more sissies than Spacek without telekinesis\nLethal as sayin' Mxyzptlk backwards when I wreck track\nI come exact to pressure punks, pain for brains I extract\nIntrude M.C.'s fears, think I'm the night creep like the black sheep\nAttacks will equalize coats cold rappers stoled from back seat\nThe mack is sweet when pimpin' stages\nPunks that think they can can next to me\nStep and see, I bring out ecstasy through complexity\nTextin' me can't out-shoot this here\nMisfits get bloody like Prom Night\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\n[Twista, Dres:]\nFuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nDres and Twista rippin' shit so motherfuckers take flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nLike a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nCatch a gist of the niggas down to set it tonight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\n[Dres:]\nYo what can you do, I stand out like a clue\nWith a twist I dissed the motherfuckers knowin' the taste of my piss\n[Twista:]\nFace to my fist disconnect necks with my checks and tape decks\nDrop rappers off my skill's apex and caught tryin' to make threats\n[Dres:]\nNigga-ro please, nigga freeze, nigga get on your knees\nAnd get killed son, I serve a billion like the Mick-a-dees\n[Twista:]\nBe no fifty degrees I freeze M.C.'s bust three to the chest\nPut teeth to the test, I kill on ship like B to the X\n[Dres:]\nYo, swingin' like nunchucks, I'm rippin' up stupid fucks in a tux\nI back, flip spin and kick a style that's deluxe\n[Twista:]\nSo what's up, I react on niggas like Jason on blow\nBlood's wasting on clothes from shanking with flows and splittin' through foes\n[Dres:]\nSee, niggas got a suicidal tendency\nTalkin' all that battle shit and we like splendid, B\nBut, keep that flavor, 'cause I got than that I gave ya\nMe and my neighbor at your funeral with party favors\n[Twista:]\nHuh, the Twista splits heads like a divorce wit' no remorse\nWild as claustrophobics in closets when I bring the Porsche\nWith galactic tactics I max it, unless a convict when I honk it\nM.C.'s from separate cities on some bomb shit, word\n[Twista, Dres:]\nFuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nDres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nLike a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\nCatch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight\nIt's like a fight when I react with a mic\n[Twista and Dres talking:]\nYeah, no doubt representin' out of New York I represent like a delegate\nSpeedknot Mobstaz, Campaign Click you know what I'm sayin'\nStraight from the Chi\nQueens what's goin' on, Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten Island\nAnd peace out to K-town, peace out to Fish City\nLong Island, the brother Mista Lawnge\nYo Lord C that brother got it goin' strong\nTerrorizin' from terror town makin' sucker M.C.'s stay down\nMy brother Steve O, J.R. yo pop\nPeace to all the 'hoods", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de56185a5feae8fc7307820980156a11.200x200x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
