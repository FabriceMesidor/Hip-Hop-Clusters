Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit\nYou ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with\nTry to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with\nNo homo, T, I had to go stupid\nI'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy\nCollins Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone\nOr the Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown\nThat mean they 24's boy, what are you on?\nI'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon\nYeah, I'm talkin' out of my head\nI make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red\nI'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka\nForever like E-T-C, period muthafucka\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever mayne\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever mayne\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nI'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind\nCause to every single record, I am so unkind\nThere are no holds barred, there is no love lost\nNigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost\nSo P-A-Y-U-P\nI don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me\nNever L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got\nThis young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht\nYa heard me?\nWho else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too\nCause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do\nYour girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo\nAnd take a bitch from any nigga is what we do\nSo bite down ho, or get the right dentist\nI told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence\nAnd understand I send shots at who it's meant for\nNever had a mentor, copy that: 10-4\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever mayne\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever mayne\n\n[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]\nPut on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit\nMake a plumber throw his plunger like, \"I can't deal with this shit\"\nThey say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch\nThe flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit\nBitch I'm back on my shit like a fly\nSince you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly\nLike Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf\nAnd throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie\nTo a shark you just sushi\nYou ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie\nSoft as newborn booty\nSaid I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast\nLook back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass\nAnd nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up\nI been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut\nThis ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'\nCause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever mayne\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever mayne", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f903dae2533e450c8d3cb233aa846020.745x745x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
