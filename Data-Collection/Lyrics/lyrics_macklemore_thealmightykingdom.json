X2\n\n[Verse 1: Professor Macklemore]\nI was born on this earth\nA child of the sun rays\nLifted by the hands of the sand and\nEver since the first day, I saw a doorway\nAnd eventually made my entrance\nEmbarked on what happened to become my fortress\nThe first sentence. In the ever glowing paragraph\nUsing words to communicate with the life forces that I call my mom and my dad\nA continuous family tree\nBlossoming with me in the middle of fate, destiny, and reality\nAs I proceeded to grow\nI met my love on the radio\nAnd knew that I had to be down with the Knights of the Round Table\nAt the age of 13, began to work out my flow\nMet Mind Control\nAnd a year later pulled the sword from the stone\n\n[Hook]\nWe\u2019re psilocybin spoken word carriers\nMessage translators\nAnd debaters soul saviors\nSending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums\nThe movement\u2019s through music\nIn tune with the almighty kingdom.
