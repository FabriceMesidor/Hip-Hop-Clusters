I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nI said, so what the deal, ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, what the deal?\nI'm feeling hard as hell right now homie\nI almost feel... invincible and shit\nAy Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool\nI'm unstoppable\nDamn", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7b93181ae4ed594c902bf7e4e2149ca7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
