You know what he want? Money, nigga. You know what your bitch want, you know why they feel they can't fuck with you? 'Cause you don't have no money, my nigga. Bitches do not want a nigga with no money. Did you not learn this in Harlem? Lesson number one. You can't keep saying you a Harlem nigga and you don't want that skrilla, nigga. Come on B, it's home of the hustlers, nigga. Nigga, that's all you gotta understand. It's the hood nigga. It's make guap or die, nigga.\"\n\n\"What do you think? 'Cause he gotta know, my nigga. Money is not evil, nigga. Go tell them niggas in Polo you don't wanna make no money, nigga. What they gon' say, \"Oh, he right\"? Hell no, nigga. You think niggas like selling crack and shit nigga? You think niggas like putting crack in they ass nigga, and selling cracks out they ass? You think niggas like shooting niggas, my nigga? You think niggas like tucking packs? You think niggas like baggin' up? You know how boring baggin' up is, my nigga? It's so boring, my nigga. There is no underground, Joe Budden is on his fourth mixtape selling shit. The underground is Koch, nigga. There is no underground nigga. You don't see Raekwon or none of these niggas on the block. You don't see none of them niggas on the block. There's no more block, nigga, it's over for the block. You ask any nigga on the block, do they wanna be on the block? They gon' say no, nigga. Get your money, man. Stop trying to be gooned out, my nigga\n\n\"Hood niggas don't want to be\u2014\"\n\n\"Hood niggas don't want to be hood niggas, my nigga. Everything niggas do, everything niggas do in the hood is for money, my nigga. What's one thing that niggas do in the hood that ain't for money? What bitch would want a nigga with no money? Huh? Huh!? Yo, slime! It's your time.\"", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/95b8df8c64be12f5f81c47ff5616a4a3.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
