(yeah, Nickle. Yeah.)\n\nVerse 2:\nAll my life, I lived a life of beats, rhymes and street shit\nHad my ups and downs, hustling around but in these times, I\nThrow up the peace sign, who I eat with, its feast time\nNow rewind, I used to listen to Esham in a Nissan\nNow I'm ridin' round' the D in Porsche's\nAnd I don't need media sources, to enforce that we important\nJust for the moment, don't let it get to your head, don't\nAllow your mind to be weak and you gotta be headstrong\nI made it here, embodying all of my latest fears\nDrunk as at the party, still my cadence clear\nMy equilibrium on the same zone my swag on\nCar riding good, she in a good mood, her ride gone\nJust like my bitch\nJust my mistress, she likes my bitch but can't have her\nBefore I snitch, I think I'd rather; drop dead\nBefore I drop a dime like Hank Gathers, that's devastation\nI take my life myself, to help my self-preservation\n\nHook:\nLove or career, no limits, no fear cause\nYou can make it, you can make it\nSee success in the mirror, it's closer than it appears, know that\nYou can make it, you can make it\nOn that path you steer, straight and narrow, don't veer cause\nYou can make it, you can make it\nIn my voice you can hear, all my pain and my tears, know that\nYou can make it, you can make it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/892233b049a8da052593a9b4030be708.988x988x1.png"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
