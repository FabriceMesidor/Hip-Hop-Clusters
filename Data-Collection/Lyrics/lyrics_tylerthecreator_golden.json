I mean, you--not like you don't have anyone to talk to...\nI'm here for you, I'm your friend\nWhen I say Odd, y'all say Future\nOdd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck, fuck!\nTyler, you're doin' good. You have a cult following, you're-\nTo these white kids?\nOh, my gosh\n\n[Verse 2]\nCharbroiled nigga on these dark beats\nNauseous with the Nazi but it's normal what the cops see\nAwesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see\nMommy was a living single queen with a lat ti\nSo while my wallets piling with symbolic colored paper\nI lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age\n20, why didn't she get that abortion?\nProbably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing\nInto a Grammy-winning schizophrenic fucking orphan\nOops, I mean bastard, skinny-ass disaster\nMom works hard, still working on her masters\nSon lies about taking classes at community college\nJust to record some bullshit he calls Bastard\nStart a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way\nBefore he even had a mustache and cash\nAnd all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher\n\n[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator and Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC]\n\"Alright, just calm down\"\n\"That ain\u2019t shit, man\"\n\"Now don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make yourself seem guilty. That, that article was great\"\n\"No, fuck that, nigga\"\n\"You're beating yourself up and your living the fucking life right now, kid! When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now\"\n\"Fuck that\u2026 fuck all this shit\"\n\"You, you, you act like I\u2019m not here\"\n\"You're not\"\n\"I'm exactly who you\u2019re supposed to be talking to\"\n\"You don\u2019t fucking help me with shit\nYou don\u2019t help me with shit, fuck!\"\n\"Yeah, you get... that, that\u2014who wouldn\u2019t do that?\"\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you!\"\n\"Who wouldn\u2019t, who wouldn't shoot their friend?\"\n\"Old fucking fuck!\"\n\"That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not your fault\"\n\"I killed my fucking friends... fuck!\"\n\"I\u2019m gonna need security in here, and, uh\u2026\"\n\"Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!\nI'm, I'm not fucking crazy\u2014I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!\"\n\"Yes, come quick. He\u2019s losing it\"\n\"No, fuck this shit!\"\n\"Tyler, calm down\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'ma grab the Nina (No!) and find a nice arena\nCause I can\u2019t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina (Get security in here.)\nAnd I\u2019m not even human, I\u2019m a body shaped demon\nWith some semen in my sack and some problems in the back (Calm the fuck down!)\nAnd a life that\u2019s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate\nAnd a gat that\u2019s filled with love, now let opposites attract\nI can finally be one (No!) like a marriage in a church\nBut this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one\nThat\u2019s getting married has a curse and it\u2019s made up inside of him\nToo late to reimburse but, wait, it gets worse!\nAll the guests that\u2019s in the church all decided to disperse (Tyler...)\nSo there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse (You don't want to do this...)\nSo they tied the knot, now it\u2019s too late to reverse\nThis arrangement (Yes, it is) and the nurse is amazed\nAt the hurt that he was painting (Calm the fuck down!)\nBut it was obvious in all the photos he was paining\nNow a bunch of whispering immerse\n\n[Outro: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator as Nurse, (Security Guard), Dr. TC]\n\"Yeah, he's right there. Security's right there.\"\n\"Shit! No, get away from me.\"\n\"Get him.\"\nAnd then the nurse blurts\n(\"Come here.\")\n\"What the fuck is his problem? Here, we have two doses to give him, here\"\nWhy didn\u2019t anybody ask him first?\n(\"Get on the ground!\") \"Hold him down.\"\n\"I\u2019ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler...\"\n\"Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!\" (\"Come here, motherfucker!\")\nBecause nobody gave a fuck\n\"Get the fuck off of me...\"\nSomeone gave a fuck Tyler\nAnd, uh... the person that gave a fuck was me\nSee, you\u2019re not, going crazy... it\u2019s me. I\u2019m your best friend, Tyler\nI know everything, I know everything about you\nYou\u2019ve been helping yourself this whole time. Your friends? They\u2019re just figments of your imagination\nDr. TC... See Tyler, I\u2019m your conscience\nI\u2019m Tron Cat, I\u2019m Ace, I\u2019m Wolf Haley, I\u2019m...
