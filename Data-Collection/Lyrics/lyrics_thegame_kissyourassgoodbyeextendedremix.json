connects with pops, we boofin the weed planes\nHit my khaki's, watched them pressed for food stamps\nRespectin the jail, or checkin the mail\nI stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill\nYou let them DC niggas have sex in your cell\nYou live with a gun, you like gettin hit from the front\nStand some shit, like two dicks with no bitch\nRumor has it, you like your chicks with no

nigga you run with the fags, you pussy\nI shoot at your man put him in a bag you push me\nAfter you flop im takin your fans\nGive you a reason to do that dumb shit with your hands\nPiss in your mouth and burn your promotional van\nCome to your wake and slap all 3 of your fans\nGet your mind right\nOr get your mind put right next to them all white air nikes\nNails in your coffin leave them locked

Hov to get close to the crown\nI take a couple Ooh's and Aah's, jewls and cars\nScrew some broads, and I'm still cool with Nas\nYa real subtle still, so fuckin ill\nHow you can turn an idea into a couple mill\nBut everybody got they hand in the pot\nSo either you cut them off or hand them a knot\nAnd I ain't neva planning to stop, im planning to rock\nTill the rims matchin the top, and the Phantom is drop\nThey?ll neva get away with the shit I pull off god\nNice on the clutch even though I pull off hard\nAnd you know the old kiss, you don't know the grown kiss\nGot bout 5 in me until I
