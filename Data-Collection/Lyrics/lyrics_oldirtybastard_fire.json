You out of your mind\nCuz I stay on track, like transit line (FIRE!)\nKeep it nappy or braided up\nDirty in the cockpit, blazin' up (FIRE!)\nStop frontin' when you made it up\nTellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up (FIRE!)\nHah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites\nStill trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss (FIRE!)\nYou know why niggas don't give you much respect\nCuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat (FIRE!)\nKnow Dirt, like bow know death\nWhen I'm huntin' down, birds in rap (FIRE!)\nHate Dog, cuz I ate your cat\nAnd you can eat my ass and have a coke with that (FIRE!)\nUse a spoon, unless you want a fork\nPull my dick out, watch the room get dark (FIRE!)\nStay high with the zombie walk\nGotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks\n\n[Chorus: sample (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]\nFIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Let me hear it)\nFIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Ohhhhhhhhh)\nFIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Let me hear it, ohhhhhhhhhhh)\n[Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nWhat can make a hoe, look more cuter\nBut, Hennessey shots, and smoke more Buddha (FIRE!)\nNow you hungry, wanna eat right through her\nBut you better first track for a noter (FIRE!)\nLike does she have a best friend, or a daughter\nHas she ever tried fuckin' under water (FIRE!)\nMisinterpetate, let me break it down\nTwo pulls make the your merry go round (FIRE!)\nTouch your toes, show me that rose\nButt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose (FIRE!)\nWide open, girl, everything goes\nReal freaky, when you powder that nose\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d7e323c108da42ed17c2a306b8658e1d.500x335x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard"}
