Haha no they won't, no they won't}\n\nYou're waitin for the devil to come from the ground\nClown, take a look around\nJust look at the cross that the priest is holdin\nA beast, in sheep's clothing\nBut I'm rollin, with that knowledge of self\nCause heaven, ain't just wealth\nSo mister preacher, if I couldn't pay my tithe\nDo I have to wait outside?\nWhite man, please take another look\nCause we couldn't be readin out the same book\nCause you'se a crook and I'm a brother\nKing James had sex with his mother\nIs that yo' edition? Is that your religion?\nBlack man, you gotta make a desicion\nCause God is comin on day number seven\nAnd they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven\n\n{They won't call me a nigga}\n{when I get to heaven}\n{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}\n{They won't call me a nigga}\n{when I get to heaven}\n{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}\n\nThe same white man that threw me in the slammer\nHe bombed the church in Alabama\nSo if I cock the hammer, God won't mind\nIf I have to kill the human swine\nCause God is a killer from the start\nWhy you think, Noah had to build his Ark?\nAnd God is a man from his feet to his hair\nThat's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer\nI just stare at the church man\nSpendin mo' money on the church band\nBut Elijah's got a plan\nGot the white man screamin - Damn that Farrakhan!\nCause one day these babies'll uprise\nMuch more than bow ties and bean pies\nKickin knowledge at the 7-11\nAnd they won't, call me a nigga, when I get to heaven\n\n{They won't call me a nigga}\n{when I get to heaven}\n{No they won't! Haha no they won't, no they won't}\n--] repeat all 8X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd986178756b67188db2d06a77696b78.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
