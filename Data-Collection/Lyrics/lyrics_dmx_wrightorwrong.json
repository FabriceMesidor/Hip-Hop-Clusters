Not likely\nAnd even though we both know that you a cat, you still be tryin to bite me\nC'mon vato, gato\nThat's a real bitch move you made, you know the rest, uh-oh\nWalk like a man you gots to talk like a man\nChin up, with a limp, dick in your hand!\n\n[Chorus]\nRyde or die, right or wrong\nNiggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm\nThen they split, don't wanna ride to the storm\n(I love you my nigga)\nShoulda known that was bullshit all along\n\n[DMX]\nWhatever the fuck I do I go all out\nWait for a few days, ryde or die, fuck out bitch!\nI ain't got time for these cats that wanna pretend\nLike they gon' ride 'til the end\nCause soon as you hit a bump niggas jump ship\nBut when it's all good same niggas suck dick\nMoney is the root of all evil\nI ain't a fake nigga, and never had a reason to deceive you\nDon't nobody do for me, but me\nA nigga gon' be alright, you'll see\nWhen I need a friend, God sends me one\nWhen I need some ends, he saved me some\nWhatever I need I get it, so I don't want for nothin\nAnd I ain't gotta hunt for nothin\nSittin on ten whips, a few chips\nAnd that mayne with the laser from the hip catch you slip\n\n[Chorus]\nRyde or die, right or wrong\nNiggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm\nThen they split, don't wanna ride to the storm\n(I love you my nigga)\nShoulda known that was bullshit all along\n\n[Outro]\nWHAT?
