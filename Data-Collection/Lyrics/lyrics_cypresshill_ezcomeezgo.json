(it's the Hill, baby!)\nIt's the Hill, baby! (it's the Hill, baby!)\nEasy they go when you got no mo'!\nSpit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)\nSpit it real, baby! (spit it real, baby!)\nC'mon! (c'mon!)\nEasy they come when they want your soul!\nShit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)\nShit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)\nEasy they go when yo' shit gets old\nShit is real crazy! (shit is real crazy!)\nThe game is so shady lately! (the game is so shady lately!)\n\n[Verse 2 : Sen Dog]\nThis business ain't nothing\nBut a series of comebacks (comebacks!)\nWrite you off as dead 'til you\nCome back with a bomb track! (bomb track!)\nMan you got to save food\nCause they said you washed-up (it was washed up!)\nEven if your prays nothin'\nAll over your hot stuff! (all over your hot stuff!)\nThat's right I believe in myself and my talent (that's right!)\nSkills have been diminshed; motherfucker\nThere you have it! (there you have it!)\nYou got to learn the game\nMaster every angle (master every angle!)\nLike a zen master runnin'\nThe triangle! (runnin' the triangle!)\nJust when they think\nThat you're all dried up (you're all dried up!)\nSurprised that they asked when\nThe back don't cut! (when the back don't cut!)\nAll around the globe\nKeep a silent fan base, (shut up!)\nHip-Hop icon -\nTell you what it takes! (tell you what it takes!)\nPatience, persistence. -\nPerseverance! (perseverance!)\nKnow it in your song, they gon' love it\nWhen they hear it!\n[?] the career been down\nAnd [?] for years!\nNobody's takin' me out;\nI'll decide when I'm outta here! (I'll decide when I'm outta here!)\n\n[Pre-Hook : Sen Dog]\nThat's right y'all!\nEZ come EZ go!\n[?] Cypress Hill, dog!\nWe takin' it forever, G!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : B-Real]\nI got love for every fan\nEver part of the plane\nSo while you can take some pictures\nAnd sign some autographs\nShare a couple of hits\nOf my kush [?] is you should ask\nBut if you push!\nThen I put my foot in your ass!\nNot many in this game would\nLast so long\nSo they can get what they can\nBefore the time is done\nPeople are gona stay with you\nBut you must never mislead them\nBut if you treat them wrong\nLead them on they'll say: \"We don't need you!\"\nThen it's back to\nThe streets to square one\nNow you're screaming:\n\"This ain't fair!\" Yeah\nBut nobody cares!\nYou had the money and the cars\nBig house and pearls\nJewels and hot beats\nSo that you could spit out words!\nSo much time and emotion invested\nFrom being on top;\nNigga, can't get arrested!\nEZ come, EZ go;\nWhen they forget who you are\nForget you were star\nForget you in every regard!\n\n[Outro : Sen Dog]\nYeah!\nMy maaan... still comin' at-chaaaaa!\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ba0b8e63a4232511ca30fcd1b8eaf1b4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
