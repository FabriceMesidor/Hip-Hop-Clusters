Then we fuck already know the deal\nShit, fuck what you look like just show the real\nThen I keep spot that we can go to chill\nI Love life, get down for the hoes\nOnly reason I come round is for the hoes\nLife works, I play it down for the hoes\nHit em off wit that dark brown you kno?\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\n\nDrag-On verse\n\nYou fucking wit' me ain't keeping your health right\n'Cuz me and my dogs we keep it gelled tight\nThe shit I pack is heavy but the shells light\nWhen they drop the same time you drop without a fight\nBurning anything that I'm putting my name on\nYou might take a Drag but you can't flame On\nI know y'all niggas don't know me wit' a chain on\nWhen it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on\nWhen you see like eight cars then y'all know where we are\nNiggas spitting mean bars off the green jar\nNever drunk but you see me limp at the bar\nSpit fire that'll melt the ice on your arm\nYou had that but for now dog give me that\n'Cuz y'all you don't wanna see how my simmy act\nFake hustling niggas you'll pump any pack\nWhen it come to this shit I done laid plenty flat\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nDo you hear wat I tell you, understand wat u hear\nDon't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear\nDon't let nobody tell you wat to hope and to fear\n\nWhat you niggas want? 'Cuz I got it right here\nY'all niggas front then I hit you right there\nNot really impressed by what niggas wear\nFaggots talk shit but I really don't care\nI'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause\nFuck what you heard I will die for my dogs\nAin't scared of shit will ride in the fog\nSame thing but a bigger size than yours\nI fuck with Drag-On 'cuz he spits the flame\nDrag-On motherfucker don't forget the name\nAnd we all taking over ain't shit the sa\nIf you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game\nAnd\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\n\nAin't no other cats got love for me\nAin't no cats goin' bust slugs for me\nAin't no cats goin' shed blood for me\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us\nBut my dogs is goin' be a thug wit me us", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a4366ca22169cc286a183e693f3a6ee9.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
