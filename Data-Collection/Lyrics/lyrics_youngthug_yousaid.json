(Freaky-deeky)\nWhere all that at? Oh, I thought so\nYou got high a level of confidence, you know what I'm saying\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that (You said that)\nYou said you gon' do me the worst\nI remember you right when you said that (I remember you)\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest\nTo my navel and dick and nuts (You said all that)\nWe talked about everything\nThen you know that we got us some making up (Ooh)\nI lick on that puss on a pill\nAnd I make her stand up like some bunny ears (Bunny ears)\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes\nAnd her soul go outta here (Go outta here)\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life\nLike I'm Dr. Phil (Dr. Phil)\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I need you to say now)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now)\nI want you to say now\nSay now (Jeffery!), ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n[Verse 1: Young Thug]\nI got the door unlocked\nAnd I know right now she'd rather have my dick than a watch (Facts)\nAnd I'm not right about everything\nBut I got a strong feeling she'll take me a charge if we run into the narcs\nAnd I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches\nUnwrap the birds, get to rolling\nI ain't never needed nothing brodie\nAll four pockets, macaroni\nRose-gold AP like a token (Token)\nBought that bitch a mink, now she cozy\nRather go to jail, I ain't told 'em (Yeah)\nI get excited when I see you (Excited)\nI'd rather freeze up and get shy when I see you\nI'm daydreaming and I\u2019m steady just strappin' our child in the rearview (Ayy)\nIf you a cool one you a real one\nLet's go to Africa, to the Pilgrim (Ayy)\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death when you see me\nYou said that, you said that (You said that)\nYou said you gon' do me the worst\nI remember you right when you said that (I remember you)\nYou said you gon' kiss from my neck to my chest\nTo my navel and dick and nuts (Dick and nuts)\nWe talked about everything\nThen you know that we got us some making up (Ooh)\nI lick on that puss on a pill\nAnd I make her stand up like some bunny ears\nI bite on her butt and I suck on her toes\nAnd her soul go outta here\nShe look at him like he roadkill and I turned 'round her life\nLike I'm Dr. Phil (Dr. Phil)\nLet's get freaky deeky 'round here\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & Quavo]\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (Say now)\nSay now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to)\nSay now, ooh,

leave, but where am I gonna stay?\nShe hid the keys in the attic, she even tried to hide my Patek (Keys)\nPlease stop being petty, I don't want no more spaghetti\nMy side bitch in the driveway, yeah\nWaiting on you to leave, bae, yeah\nYou gotta know, yeah, the time changed\nI don't know what's on your mind frame\nBut I gotta go and gangbang\nThe streets mine so I switch lanes\nYou said \"I won't change\" (Won't change)\nYou said \"I won't change\" (Won't change)\nI regret I put you up on game (Regret it)\nI regret I told your mama \"Life would change\" (Momma)\nYeah, out of all the cash, I put on her (Cash)\nOut of all the bags, I put on her (All the bags)\nAnd I said I don't brag, I don't boast\nSince you popped the tags, I don't want 'em\nAnd my niggas they been placed the vote (Vote)\nBut you needed to get off the boat (Boat)\nI can't blame it on me I said \"No\" (No)\nGot her head so big it explode (Explode)\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug]\nYou said you gon' fuck me to death
