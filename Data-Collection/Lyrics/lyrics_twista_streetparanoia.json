(Damn, I can't face the paranoia...)\nYou never know who's coming for ya, my mind is my destroyer...\n(I can't face the street's paranoia...)\nYou never know who's coming for ya, the streets can destroy ya... (Damn, I can't face the paranoia...)\nYou never know who's coming for ya, my mind is my destroyer...\n(I can't face the street's paranoia...)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs paranoia takes over, my heart stays colder\nGhetto slang holder, but still look over my shoulder\nTo see a shorty drink 40s and pop a pistol\nFor no reason, so the only issue is hope the bullet miss you\nMy mind goes in rages when outrages like some front' pages read murder committed by kids of younger ages\nAll these thugs know is drugs and chrome\nCus' Every night they never saw hugs and homes, just slugs and domes\nPunks'll slang a game of starstacks, it's hard to face the raw facts\nI witness bullets scar backs of carjacks\nAnd through this all I make allot for days\nWon't drop my ways at night they pop a gauge but still I chose to rock the stage\nIs this a death trap as my every rep raps, the tales that left caps\nIn the bodies that finally get my mind collapsed\nI'm hearing toxin', some pistols cockin', their poppin' bodies droppin'\nParanoia's got me, Constantly watchin'\nDrugs and murder, imperial dealers and serial killers\nKids turn into casket fillers and hypes, the stillest\nIt's comin' for ya Is every man created a destroyer?\nDamn, I can't face the paranoia...\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe paranoia's killing me, terror's trilogy\nIn days to come do  you think we still a' be using artillery? Huh. Some kill for fun and enjoyment\nOthers for unemployment\nSometimes, I wanna say \"fuck it\" grip me a gun and point it\nHerb eaters, thoughts of diseases as the flesh peels\nBut still the test builds;\nI slowly start to see that stress kills\nMy willpower, I buss my best skills, but can't bear it\nSights of mack shooters, crack tooters\nMy thoughts are transparent\nBut yet deep, it's hard to get sleep, my eyes flinch\nBeat the man in the dark trench\nDead on the park bench\nBullets sparks pitch, that shove an innocent child\nEven though at the station Glocks pow, my mind is hostile\nNow my style is being affected from it\nTo protect myself from catching one in the stomach\nI'll be quick to gun 'em\nThe results: I might need a lawyer...\nTo keep myself from being locked in a cage facin' the paranoia", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de56185a5feae8fc7307820980156a11.200x200x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
