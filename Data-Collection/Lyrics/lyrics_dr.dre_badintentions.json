She with the Aftermath\nCalled her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath\nNo talkin, fuck how your day go\nYou want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so\nDon't be shy now, probably the best at it\nThey say a party ain't a party until the west at it\nGravitate to the Doc like it's automatic\nTake your clothes off, make me wanna grab it\nTurn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)\nTime to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)\n\n[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al & (Dr. Dre)]\nI don't give a fuck cause I'm just\nDrinkin, smokin, straight West-coasting\nBitches puttin ass in motion\nPussy poppin, sex promotin\nGot a cup?
