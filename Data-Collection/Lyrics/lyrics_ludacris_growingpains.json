Joe's and Thundercats\nWe was lovin' that\nBefore they started jackin jacks\nFor notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through\nCollege Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars\nBe aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care\nKids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin\nDouble dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet\nWant your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say \"sweat\"\nIt's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch\nThump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch\nSlouch socks, box Chevy Caprice\nHot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace\nWit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents\nNo comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park\n\n[Hook: Keon Bryce]\nWe were tryin so hard\nHard to survive\nCause even though we were young\nWe had to stay strong\nNo matter what we went through\nIt was me and my crew\nAnd that's how it went\nWhen we were kids\n\n[Ludacris]\nI had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat\nI was simply red from the years I been holdin' back\nWith two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches\nAnd set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches\nA child of the corn been wild since I was born\nClimbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn\nShoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy\nWherever I go they went they my buddies\nI brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets\nDreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats\nCats with gold teeth and raps with such beats\nMacks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf\nWhen I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action\nStarin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one\nWanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys\nAnd be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man\n\n[Hook] - repeat 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6be5b941352dc17a593995dffd367cec.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
