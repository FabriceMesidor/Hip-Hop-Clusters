(After you die)\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you ever think\nWhat life would be\nWhere you will go\nAfter you die?\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nCould we come back, do we get left in the past?\nFuck that, I'mma kick death in the ass\nTo come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater\nGet insight so I could design and find data\n'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view\nFocus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you\nWatchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time\nBut im with you even if I don't cross your mind\nWhen you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac\nWhen you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact\nTry to look after my people, that's trapped in evil\nPlayin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos\nAnd still do some of the things that I love to do\nHang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two\nSee women and catch'em in their wildest dreams\nPossess 'em, make'em do the wildest things\nAnd my peeps, what I'mma do, is pray that you blessed\nAnd my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death\nSo just in case if I pass tonight\nYo, im prepared for what's after life. (After you die)\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you ever think\nWhat life would be\nWhere you will go\nAfter you die?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a07da7e37a6306d0e29285084f5afb9e.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
