Phases that I go through\nDazed and I'm so confused\nDays that I don't know who gave these molecules to\nMe, what am I gon' do?\nHey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one\nVery methodical when I slaughter them\n\n[Hook]\nIt's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\nI said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\n\n[Bridge]\nShe puts the lotion in the bucket\nIt puts the lotion on the skin\nOr else it gets the hose again\nShe puts the lotion in the bucket\nIt puts the lotion on the skin\nOr else it gets the hose again\n\n[Verse 3]\nI cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast\nI can't quite remember when I had that\nMuch fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half\nA flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass\nI remember the first time I dismembered a family member\nDecember, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin\nI wrapped him in Christmas lights\nPushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces\nAnd just when I went to drink his blood\nI thought, \"I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun\"\nThat's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun\nThe sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son\nYour blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none\nIt's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run\nA secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one\nOh no, there's probably none\nHe can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs\nBut ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause\u2026\n\n[Hook]\nIt's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\nI said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\n\n[Outro]\nYo, yo, ayo (Evil\u2026 rise)\nYo, yo, ayo (Evil\u2026 rise)\nYo, yo, ayo (Evil\u2026 rise)\nYo, yo, ayo (Evil\u2026 rise)\n(Evil\u2026 rise)\n(Evil\u2026 rise)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/35fb3ef95f68fd39cfbf82749a7b0235.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
