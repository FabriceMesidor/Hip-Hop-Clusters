Look in the mirror\nDon't give a fuck what they think, you're the one, you're the truth\nGot the juice, got the juice, got the juice, got the juice\nMothafucka you the man like an 8th grade Jew\nYou can chew through any zebra ass in the zoo\nAny nigga tryna act hard as some leather boots, fuck them\nAnd anyone tryna step on you, fire burnin'\nNigga learnin', stay concernin' bout your paper\nNow and later ain't really good time\nFor a nigga 'bout his business on Wood Crest Manor\n\n[Hook: Gucci Mane]\nI got a pocket full of dead people\nEvil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread\nGot a pocket full of dead people\nEvil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread\nI got a pocket full of dead people\nEvil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread\nGot a pocket full of dead people\nEvil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread", "image": "https://images.genius.com/30a64b67721e5de9310a67b5a45eefcb.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Gucci Mane"}
