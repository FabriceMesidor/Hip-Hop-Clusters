What?  Where?  Who?\nWhat?  Whattyathinkinabout\nWhen who says what when how\nYou can't maybe follow my style\nYou be the child, I be the teacher\nSmile, who said when, what\nMouth not shut, what?\nWhenever however whenever\nWhatever the cut\nHow you maybe could you ever\nBelieve, that you could so quickly achieve\nThese crafts, please laugh at his stupid ass\nUpon your knees in glass\nYou lust, for everything but trust\nSo we bust back, with conciously charged art\nWith a mic instead of a brush\n\nBut am I over ya head?\nAm I over ya head?\nBut am I over ya head?\nYo am I over ya head?\nAm I over ya head?\nYo am I over your head?\nYo am I over ya head?\nListen..\n\nYes, us must trust us, who?  Us must trust\nNot fuss with us, us must trust us discuss trusting us\nUs must trust us, who? Us must trust\nNot fuss with us, us must trust us discuss thus trusting us\nTrusting us, us must trust discuss\nDiscuss not trusting us must not fuss\nUs with us means us discussing trusting us\nUs must trust us, who?  Us must trust\nNot fuss with us, us must dicuss trusting us\n\nBut am I over ya head?\nYo am I over your head?\nBut am I over ya head?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d8a06de1f39a224dcb05e3e9195e0b4.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
