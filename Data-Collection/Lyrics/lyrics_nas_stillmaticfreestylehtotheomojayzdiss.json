City, grab a hold and ride with me\n\nRip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with money bags\nStop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast\nAnd bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York\nYou show off, I count off when you sample my voice\nI rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens\nNas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?\nIs he H to the izzo, M to the izzo?\nFor shizzle you phony, the rapper version of Sisqo\nAnd that's for certain, you cloned me, your wack clothes line\nI'd rather Sean John, bore me with your fake coke rhymes\nAnd those times, they never took place, you liar\nUn was your first court case, you had no priors\nYou master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick\nHave you surrounded, you and them faggot you down with\n\nWhile they riding NAS, trying to boost their careers\nCorny as Cormega, all you Hip-Hop queers\nSince Illmatic, It Was Written: I Am... Nastradamus\nThat's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise\nMy next few albums, instead of projects\nThey'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics\n\nCome in my hood, but bring the guns with you, it's dark\nHeaded through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx\nHeaded through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts\nNew Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block\nI'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page\nDid crimes and headline on stage\nI signed a contract, so here it is, you have it\nStreets Disciple, I'm Stillmatic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23061dd2dc7e863127db561906debd27.434x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
