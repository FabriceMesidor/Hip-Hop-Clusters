I ain't comin' in yet\nI'll come in a minute\nAyo, this is my love song, it goes like this\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nBack when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot!)\nThis is how we used to make the party start\nWe used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark\nAnd when it kicks in you can hardly talk\nAnd by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl\nAnd you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf\nAnd my prediction is you're gon' probably fall\nEither somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall\nAnd everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women\nAre swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in\nA couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished\nYou are now allowed to officially slap bitches\nYou have the right to remain violent and start wilin'\nStart a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you\nGet in your car, start it, and start drivin'\nOver the island and cause a 42-car pile-up\nEarth calling, pilot to co-pilot\nLooking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it\nAll I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'\nAnd I'm so high that I might die if I go by it\nLet me outta this place, I'm outta place\nI'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace\nI'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow\nI'll be back in an hour or so\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nIn third grade, all I used to do\nWas sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube\nSeventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude\nSchemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs\nI've got no game, and every face looks the same\nThey've got no name, so I don't need game to play\nI just say whatever I want to whoever I want\nWhenever I want, wherever I want, however I want\nHowever, I do show some respect to few\nThis ecstasy's got me standin' next to you\nGettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you\nWe just met, but I think I'm in love with you\nBut you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too\nWake up in the morning like, \"Yo, what the fuck we'd do?\"\nI gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do\n\u2018Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you\nBut in the long run, these drugs are probably\nGonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one\nSo let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord\nSo it's not a straight line no more\n'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls\nShit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur\nShit, six hits won't even get me high no more\nSo bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThat's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow\nWhen you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow\nAnd tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again\nWhat's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?\nScrew it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?\nAnd what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again\nIt's your life, live it however you wanna\nMarijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?\nIt don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'\n\u2018Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'\nThey tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'\nEven though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'\nBut you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do\nGirls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you\nIf I could take it all back now, I wouldn't\nI would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't\nBut I'm all grown up now and upgraded\nAnd graduated to better drugs and updated\nBut I still got a lotta growing up to do\nI still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew\nBut when it's all said and done, I'll be forty\nBefore I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories\nWith a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap\nBabysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dina Rae]\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nDrugs really got a hold of me\nReally got a hold of me\nThese drugs really got a hold of me\nThey really got a hold of me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7f2305258d668431f8e250a41f3459f.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
