I'on't know. How many stains?\nPrivate plane, converted over to private plane\nCookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?\nYou ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank\nI come in a tank, I come with the drank\nI come with the drapes, I crush up the face\nPatek Phillipe, I'm too unique\nGotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks\n\n[Verse 1: Future]\nI pour up codeine, I can't go to sleep\nCriminal mind, thanks to the gang, gang\nLouboutins, sittin' in a row\nLouis Vuitton's, mink on the flows\nMy migo the coldest, it got me the frozest\nI ordered the LOTUS, soon as it touched down, I sold it\nThe money is stacked up off the ground, you could never fold it\nI done got racked up, I done stacked up me a fortune\nColossal, enormous, have you seen my performance\nYou makin' it drizzle, I got it thunder and stormin'\nCash on deliver, hope you not recording\n(Cash on deliver, hope you not recording)\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nHow many stains you hit? I'on't know. How many stains?\nPrivate plane, converted over to private plane\nCookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?\nYou ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank\nI come in a tank, I come with the drank\nI come with the drapes, I crush up the face\nPatek Phillipe, I'm too unique\nGotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nI got you comfortable, but she say she love me\nI got some commas, they can't be discussed\nI weigh a ton in these streets, ain't no discussion\nI started off with a couple watches, I got 'em busted\nI got a flooded Richard Mille, it ain't no cuffin'\nShe came in blushing, she came from Russia\nDigital scale, my kind is rare\nI had to prevail, I made it through Hell\nSee the wheel on the right, when you live overseas\nThink it came overnight, how I make it look easy\nAin't a regular nigga, I accept that\nGot ahead of you niggas and I never took a step back\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nHow many stains you hit? I'ont know. How many stains?\nPrivate plane, converted over to private plane\nCookin' it up with baking soda, how many chains?\nYou ain't thinkin' how I'm thinkin', I'm goin' to the bank\nI come in a tank, I come with the drank\nI come with the drapes, I crush up the face\nPatek Phillipe, I'm too unique\nGotta stop all the leaks, get caught with the freaks", "image": "https://images.genius.com/93706895b47b1526bb155788bf485b4f.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
