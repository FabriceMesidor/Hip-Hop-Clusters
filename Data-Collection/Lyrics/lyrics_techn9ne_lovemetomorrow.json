I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI hear ya saying that I ain't the same\nBut in order to grow you know you got to change\nBut you gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Scoob]\nHere today but be gone when you blink an eye\nConstant drinking got you thinking and you about cry\nI was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain\nHeart breakin' body shakin' can you stand the rain\nI was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy\nBut now I'm gone just a portion of your memories\nBut in your memory 'member this vividly\nThere was no other villain from the hood real as me\nFrom the soil none loyal like the B.I.G\nHomie from the show me, hope that's how you 'member me\nAnd we'll soon see I ain't got long to be\nOn this earth claiming turf running in these streets\nI apologize homie look me in my eyes\nTime to turn the page be a man and swallow pride\nToo many homies died before I got to say my piece\nSo I just said my piece and hopin' that it brings us peace\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nToday is gone and I left this place\nBut I'll be the sun shining on your face\nSo just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)\nLove me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d4c4dfa3d56e3cd0f59836ef122ff24.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
