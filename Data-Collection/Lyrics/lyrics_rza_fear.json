{"songs": [{"title": "Fear", "album": "The Tao of Wu", "year": null, "lyrics": "I was afraid as a child. I was afraid of everything. I was scared of water--I couldn't swim--I was scared of trucks on the turnpike, and mostly I was scared of ghosts. But at some point, I realized something. A ghost is something you create yourself--a man's mind makes it happen. If there were nobody on Earth, would a ghost still have a chance to spook somebody? No. You manifest ghosts through fear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words of Marcus Garvey resonated with me. He said, \"Fear is a state of nervousness only fit for children. Men should not fear. The only thing man should fear is God. To fear anything other than God is to offend God.\" I carry that to this day: Enlightened men do not fear.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9416fec27305323c4a10672a8e3c4875.570x370x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
