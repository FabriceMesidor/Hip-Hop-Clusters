Look in your mind\nYour brain look like Keenan Wayans, brother\nOvergold, overload, broken soul\nNiggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up\nPlaya thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still\nWe gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp heel\nTake this home, rearrange it, change it\nDanger, Sway-zer, Lupe Laser.
