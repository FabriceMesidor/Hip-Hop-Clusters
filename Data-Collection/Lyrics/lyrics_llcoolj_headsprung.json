If the broad is thirsty\nI'll have her man reimburse me\nThe part that hurts me, is when they try to work me\nBut I could never let ya jerk me\nSteady sticking to the wall, give it up\nSneaking through the back door, live it up\nGot the champagne, pour me a cup\nGot the girls looking raw in the front\nGot a call, your man's in town\nTell the bar a-nother round\nGot all my mans holding me down\nKinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it\nI'm saying what time wanna dip wit it?\nGot playas on the grind, wanna skip wit it\nBackstage you mine, I'm a spit wit it, hey!\n\n[Hook]\nWhen we be up in the club\nWe be posting the back\nWhen we be in the club\nGirl always come to the back\nAnd we bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nWhen we be up in the club\nWe be posting the back\nWhen we be in the club\nGirl always come to the back\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\nAnd we 'bout to get our head sprung\n\n[Bridge: L.L.
