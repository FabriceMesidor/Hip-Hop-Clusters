Grand Am and land in it handstanding\nAny man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes\nSo fast it'll look like an invisible man standing\nI'm headed for hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail\n\"Bill Clinton, hit this and you better inhale\"\nCause any emcee that chooses to go against me\nIs getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky\nCame home in a frenzy, pushing a ten-speed\nScreaming at Aunt Peg\nWith three spokes sticking out of my pant leg\nEff a headache, give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain\nAnd you should be anywhere that a mic ain't\nYou rap knowing you wack\nYou act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps\nThen I'm throwing you back up 'em\nIf they don't like the track, fuck 'em\nThe rap struck 'em harder than getting hit by a Mack truck\nAnd then backed up on\nAnd any half-assed known rapper that trespass\nBetter be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch\nSo tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly\nI'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie\nI'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree\nTo stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe\nAnd when I'm down to my last breath\nI'm a climb the Empire State Building\nGet to the last step and still have half left\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\nPompous, roll with monsters and dons for accomplices\nCock non-fiction concepts constant\nBomb threat and I ain't even on yet\nOn spec, I spit thunder and you ain't even seen the storm yet\nLightning in the clouds, start a fight in the crowd\nHyper and loud, get this mic in your bowels, biting my style\nAttack all of y'all, react on the thought of y'all\nSlaughter y'all, I'm calling y'all, in fact, I'm blackballing y'all\nMore official than an ordered pistol aimed toward rappers\nBlame fame for it, shrapnel bits tore the tissue\nBurying the [?] under the gravel\nSaw off the pump handle and barrel for carrying convenience\nMy odyssey carries the [?], compare me to Phoenix\nSolid and hard and light up a star, I got to be Venus\nHuddle and bomb back, take cover and all that\nAnd try to not die, you not rugged enough\nYou just shook as soon as I step foot in this rap game\nI'm a bubble on contact like peroxide, I'm touching a cut\nYou stuck in my raps, [?]\nY'all sucking my ass, boosting my confidence a buck and a half\nI know the game, I'm a train trapped inside a name\nAnd whoever they taught me, yo, we ride the same\nI shoot crews with the truth and chew lies of change\nSpeeding on a dragon in an attempt to collide with fame\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThis 9 is lifting you six feet when I spray rounds\nHit you with six shots in mid-air and four more on the way down\nAs eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground\nYou lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now)\nNo pun intended, just hop out of this whip\nAnd leave it unattended 'fore I whip out this gun and end it\nUnless you want it dented with bullet holes in one minute\nCause I can leave your Infinit' full of those even if someone's in it\nSnatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it\nCorner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged\nBitches get slapped and grabbed by the hair and dragged\nLike cavewomen while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'\n\n[Verse 4: Royce da 5'9\"]\nYou get laced by the gun in case you try to run\nHatred on my face by the ton, get baked by the sun\nConstructed of interplanetary rock and metal\nTopping levels of combustion that's hot enough to stop the devil\nInnovative thrust that a enemy\nThe impact'll be the generated destructive energy to flatten trees\nBlack boy since birth, burst and tore the womb up\nTo hit the earth like a asteroid and blow the moon up\nTrust me, I'm the epitome, you better bust me\nAnybody can say, \"Eff [me]\", and he gon' touch me\nSmoking organic ganja inside of a stanza\nMe and my man cypher with cans of volcanic lava\nMan, and it's hot, I'm out of my head\nFrom the bottom\nI can leap out a bottomless pit and land at the top\nRaw, that's what I came out here for\nTo raise an eclipse and occasional trips to the beer store\nSwitch up the breed of emcee and stick a chick up\nVigorous speed to reach in the sea and pick a fish up\nI'm fly against all laws of gravitation\nI done crushed all ya'll, now you want a collaboration\nBut eff that, you stepped up, so I'm a eff your rep up\nAnd tear the rest up with every joint that I press up\nSo stop violence or violence'll stop you\nGot crews iller than anybody on your block do\nI roll with a white boy that pop 'shrooms\nListen to rock tunes and jump in a costume and rob you\n\n[Verse 5: Eminem]\nWhat a wonderful day, I should go outside and play\nAin't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate\n\"Hi, Ren\u00e9e, I was just about to toss a live grenade\nIn your driveway and drive away\nAre you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?\"\nBlood dripping from it\nRipping your stomach up from the waist up\nYou talk a lot of ish, but you was never ill though\nI'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow\nTipped over some cows just for a joke and a laugh\nJumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half\nWaging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange\nAnd wiped my ass with his page in Source\nDemon is here, I'm steaming this year\nI rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear\nIt's not a gimmick, trick, it's an image, I live it\nGive a what? I don't know what a \"what\" is to give it\n\n[Verse 6: Royce da 5'9\"]\nI grab your throat and squeeze it until it's swollen\nThen exceed it until it explodes over your shoulders\nPick up your urn with ashes in it and piss in it\nDiss intended to verge like a hearse with a witch in it\nNo more do I battle emcees for fun\nNow it's guns and niggas should run from the [?]\nIt's barely vivid you witness rare exhibits of terrorism\nThrough Israel and the art when even they're dark and dismal\nI'm a deranged breed, shoot me\nI'll catch a bullet in my teeth\nAnd spit it right back at you at the same speed\nI'll injure if I'm offending you, we can go to blows\nEven my interview should be a Hip-Hop Quotable\nYou can have the title, that's for brothers that's cocky\nI'll take the belt with diamonds in it like Ted DiBiase\nI'm rebelling your chains, in fact, you wack\nI'm telling you the plane still spelling your name in your raps\nYou're soft-hearted, I'll say, \"Let's take it to the streets\"\nYou'll start pleading with me before we can get the walk started\nI'm a deranged breed, so don't try to touch this\n5'9\", I told you I don't know the chorus\n\n[Verse 7: Eminem]\nForget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated\nIt takes six minutes to get applause\nAnd by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career\nAnd walk away with the floor, so you have nothing to fall back on\nI'll throw you out of ten floors\nPull a freaking headache out of my head and put it in yours\nI'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores\nTo go outdoors and do some in-stores\nThis trick wanted to blow me, I said, \"It ought to happen\"\n\"You swallow nut, girl?\" \"No, but I brought a napkin\"\nGetting skully while I'm autographing\nGot my daughter laughing\nCause I sent her mother white water rafting\nI'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear\nMr. Rogers blocking my U-Haul\nScreaming, \"You ain't moving here\"\n\"Lorena Bobbitt, come here, want a souvenir?\nI've been high as \"L\" since I was a juven-eer\nJuvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine\nCause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants\nBrain implants and they say there's a slim chance\nI won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/cfc3f76d86f9fe8fb13f12ccdaf8a0d5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
