Ow, stop shocking me now\nTell your nurse that she can put this scalpel down\nI'm back ready to rap took a little nap ready to go off\nStick to my pen, never again will I ever dose off\nNo more bozo rap it hurt me\nThe new dojo in beast mode, I'm John Cleese, no mercy!\nMy saliva and spit could fly through a brick\nPut your ass by a light and spit gas at the fire flick\nGave up homie huh? I was worse than the racists and rapists\nNow I', feeling like Kobe 'fore he scored 81\nReally feeling new! missed me with the skinny jeans and uggs\nFuck outta here, I ain't feeling you!\nFucking incredible! I can dig a hole to hell\nJust to beat the devil over the head with a fucking shovel!\n\n[Chorus: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nAs long as I'm alive the game gunna be breathing\nEven though it's, wheezing hit him like like clear clear\nWake his ass up he was sleeping\nI said as long as I'm alive the game gunna be breathing\nEven though it's, wheezing hit him like like clear clear\nWake his ass up he was sleeping", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ef2ea2d0242f3b7c5b03da3554a04b1.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
