Yea\nYes\nIma call this here... real rap\nCause this rap is real... ya know?\nI hope you ain't too tired to cry\nAnd I hope you know you ain't never too live to die\nListen\n\n[Verse]\nI grew up where them people called them people on us\nThink we slangin, but we just got beepers on us\nGrindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia\nLivin' like the videos write a treatment on us\nStuck in the hood like they put cement on us\nGhetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us\nLost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us\nSo we got the names writtin on us\nWhite folks still spittin' on us\nAnd them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us\nBut we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us\nOlder bitches still hittin' on us\nI remember well, Beezy roll the L\nBeezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed\nAnd that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga\nBut I know thats how it happened my nigga\nShit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga\nBut now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen\nSo I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga\nNo fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas\nCause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him\nLast time we seen him was when Katrina hated\nFound his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy\nHe was a East boy, and so was Wesy West\nHe was a good nigga, so I know he blessed\nAnd his daughter is a princess\nThis shit is harder than a bench press\nBut I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat\nBut I'mma keep on pumpin the flow\nSo if I cry dont stop the beat\nI feel like my heart just stopped the beat\nMy nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key\nEither that or load the gat and go pop a G\nAnd because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine\nI pray his family and his mama fine\nSo much shit just sit on this mind of mine\nI think about it all the time\nI drink about it all the time\nI smoke back to back\nCause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap\nOr I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man\nYea\nAnd fuck a man with a badge\nCause he ain't shit to a man on the edge\nThe five o killed naughty good boy dead\nMan you woulda thought they killed corn bread\nShot 'em up face down on the lawn\nNot to mention with his handcuffs on\nNot to mention they had plain clothes on\nAnd the complaint goes on\nBut don't nobody do nothin' bout it\nThe jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded\nAnd haters at an all time high\nEverybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod\nShit and they tried to burn my phantom up\nBut I got my gun license, I got my hammers up\nI'm ready to shoot like a camera\nStay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer\nCause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer\nYea\nAnd you can put that on my late father\nOr my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter\nOr my grandfather Larry Bosock\nThe old man hustle 'till his heart stopped\nAnd all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money\nNo bank account, that brown paper bag money\nYea he might hit me off wit a little brag money\nBut the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me\nBut look how I turned out I hope he glad for me\nBut thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -\nCause he's a joke to me\nDon't message, don't call, don't talk to me\nIt's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be\nAnd I make sure she paid like she wrote for me\nAnd I know she gets all hope for me\nAnd I don't ever want to see her mope for me\nHopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me\nBut we gone pray it's as far as the future sees\nYou are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby\nAmen", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c2b7af50f49ccee2f383487d50af773.740x740x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
