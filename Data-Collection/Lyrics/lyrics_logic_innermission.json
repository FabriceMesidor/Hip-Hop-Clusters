I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space\u2014\nBut there was droid ships everywhere...\nWell, thank you for your time, sir\nI appreciate the interview...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b9b6844bdd8ebfbe10235ad54d885cfa.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
