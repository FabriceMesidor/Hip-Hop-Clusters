baby\nIt's deeper than the rap\n\n[Hook: Kevin Cossom]\nDoin' 150 miles and runnin'\nGet up in my way then you know that I'm gunnin'\nLaugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny\nGettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us\nWe the usual suspects\nThe real definition of success\nBlowin' money cause I can and I love it\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nYou know them boys on the dock tryna take us in\nBecause we bringin' all of that paper in\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\n17, time to man up\nFeed the fam boy, I put that on these canned goods\nAll I got was diabetes and a damn Ugg\nPeople talkin' down, callin' me a damn scrub\nYoung niggas, all you want to do is roam free\nOn your own feet, got to cook your own beef\nI'm too cool for lame dudes to ridicule\nI laugh while I'm doin' laps in the swimming pool\nI don't owe you niggas nothin'\nThrow me two fingers when you see a nigga stuntin'\nBlack Philip Drummond, limousines are the Hummer\nPenthouse suite, pretty beach, I call her Summer\nLot of homies passed, see 'em in the future\nRunnin' so fast, on the gas, never neutral\nGot to keep a shooter while I'm ridin' in the 7\nHigher than a kite by the time I get to Heaven\n\n[Hook: Kevin Cossom]\nDoin' 150 miles and runnin'\nGet up in my way then you know that I'm gunnin'\nLaugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny\nGettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us\nWe the usual suspects\nThe real definition of success\nBlowin' money cause I can and I love it\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nYou know them boys on the dock tryna take us in\nBecause we bringin' all of that paper in\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nAnd still my talent is yet to be challenged\nHad no jet with my own pilot, no blastin' off with Flex or DJ Khaled\nMy mom stressin' college\nBut my crude sense of logic did allude to my empty wallet\nTry spittin' on a green tinted Accord\nWhich could mean a sentence up North, where the homie was\nBut back then dough was like a whore that Goldie love, it didn't exist\nAnd Officer Foldy Cuffs was after my wrists\nWas not Beverly Hills where we chilled\nImagine this, the Nazareth had to get from rags to rich\nI used to stand on rooftops with two Glocks\nFigurin', how do I turn my Timberlands to Crocs?\nNow reptiles was left out, I'm 'bout a watch, what is you thinkin'?\nMurk you, plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothing to me\nIf you thuggin' or fake and shanked on Cuban, shout out my Ricans\nDealt with all of you gangstas from the roughest Jamiacans and Haitians\n\n[Hook: Kevin Cossom]\nDoin' 150 miles and runnin'\nGet up in my way then you know that I'm gunnin'\nLaugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny\nGettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us\nWe the usual suspects\nThe real definition of success\nBlowin' money cause I can and I love it\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nYou know them boys on the dock tryna take us in\nBecause we bringin' all of that paper in\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nIf you follow physics, nigga, money never float\nMeanin' every day I'm livin' tryna stay afloat\nComin' from a boss, I can predict a double cross\nHandlers managin' money they'll never come across\nAspen to Africa, magnanimous numbers involved\nAK-47s singin' winter, by summer you fall\nI dealt with broads and those willin' to sell they soul\nOver cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes\nAs my fetti grow, fuck her, feed her Spaghetti-Os\nI'm club hoppin' in Cali, shout out to Harry-O\nSomebody dim the lights, triple black tux\nKeyser S\u00f6ze in the flesh, it's time to catch up\nI run with niggas who destined to get a life sentence\nGet they baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits\nMy nigga got a dub and love to do the push ups\nI got a million cash, tryna get the kush up\n\n[Hook: Kevin Cossom]\nDoin' 150 miles and runnin'\nGet up in my way then you know that I'm gunnin'\nLaugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny\nGettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us\nWe the usual suspects\nThe real definition of success\nBlowin' money cause I can and I love it\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nYou know them boys on the dock tryna take us in\nBecause we bringin' all of that paper in\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nDoin' 150 miles and runnin'\nGet up in my way then you know that I'm gunnin'\nLaugh about the dough but really ain't nothin' funny\nGettin' rich in a rush, yeah you know us\nWe the usual suspects\nThe real definition of success\nBlowin' money cause I can and I love it\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\nYou know them boys on the dock tryna take us in\nBecause we bringin' all of that paper in\nFrom nothin', to somethin'\nYou know us, we the usual suspects\n\n[Outro: Rick Ross]\nMaybach Music\nIt's deeper than the verse baby\nIt's deeper than the
