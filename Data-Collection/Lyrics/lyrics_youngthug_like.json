girls have fun with your tip like\nI'm smoking on a pound while you're smoking on a zip like\nUp in Vegas and I'm stacking up my chips (while you're stacking all your chips)\nDiamond corona like I stacked up all the bills (might stack up all the bills)\nCause I know these niggas gonna tell (just made bail)\nCan't blame it on 'em man they only being themselves\n\n[Verse 1: Young Thug]\nDropping the roof on the coupe\nI got some bitches they wanna be fruity\nAnd they know I need 'em all like a [tooly?]\nTrae The Truth say that he does and I knew this\nFuck that lil bitch right inside of the movies\nBaby don't try to act hard with the coochie\nIf he a shooter one day he gon' prove it\nLil bitty bit' got big titties they hooters\nYour icecream, girl I want your icecream\nHer lips big, she's a motherfucking pisces\nI will never touch it [unless?] you like it's some white jeans\nThem big ole diamonds with no lights they still gon' bright things\nI'ma bri-bri-bright it, that pussy wet as a fire hydrant\nI know gangsters they can't live without a body\nMake that bad bit' suck on my dick just for paparazzi\nTell that bit' to suck this dick \u2018till it boil like a sausage\nMoney name is [D?] I'll take you overseas\nOpen sign on baby come and sleep\nGet stoned with thugger for the fucking week\n[?] for the fucking G\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nCopped that coupe, got rid of the roof like\nUp in H town young girls with them booties like\nGood head girls have fun with your tip like\nI'm smoking on a pound while you're smoking on a zip like\nUp in Vegas and I'm stacking up my chips (while you're stacking all your chips)\nDiamond corona like I stacked up all the bills (might stack up all the bills)\nCause I know these niggas gonna tell (just made bail)\nCan't blame it on 'em man they only being themselves\n\n[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]\nI got your ho in the back of this foreign\nYeah fucking we got everything going\nShe 'bout that shit that you see in the movies\nNo sleeping this chain got me looking like morning\nI'm bright as a light while she high as a kite\nAs she play with the pipe I know something ain't right\nWhen we hit it no fight ain't no telling she might\nI just tell her don't bite or it's gon' be goodnight\nI was dick sticking she was overdosing\nI was tipping slow like I was over coasting\nLead pipe no over boasting\nJust wave surfing while I coast the ocean\nI am the truth I am not a loser\nJust a playa nigga that would like to use you\nI might kill it but I never will abuse you\nBaby fuck with me or else I might excuse you\nTryna' get up in a thug\nLike it ain't no where to go\nI know you heard it all before\nDon't like you sneaking in the door\nTell your partner she can see the sun\nCause this money on me gotta blow\nHit the club and make it overflow\nAnd these diamonds on me gotta glow\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nCopped that coupe, got rid of the roof like\nUp in H town young girls with them booties like\nGood head girls have fun with your

m'am\nBae with me got a ass so fat I gotta grab that with both hands\nSee I'm a rich nigga keep that cake all over my thoughts\nOnly one rule to the game my nigga that's don't get caught\nTake it off bitch bend over let me see it\nI think you should get that pussy up inside this European\nBetter yet just give me brain while a nigga change lanes\nI call you boo, bae, and my bitch cause shit to me they all the same\nAnd I never gave a fuck, hardly ever gave a damn\nShe let me inside it I had to tell her \"Thank you M'am\"\nThat's how she know I got manners\nAnd she know my bands up\nShe ride my dick with her hands up\nAnd take that 'til she can't stand up\nCash ruling everything around me I want C.R.E.A.M\nAnd that Porsche 9-1-1 filled up with 91 supreme\nSo you know I got to smash put my pedal to the metal\nFeel like Noah asking God \"Why he done flooded out my bezel?\" (Hold up)\n\n[Hook: Young Thug]\nCopped that coupe, got rid of the roof like\nUp in H town young girls with them
