If not best, then better\nHere's a hint: The 18th letter\nThe rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable\nFor any immortal man, swords is not affordable\nNever take a loss 'cause I'm hard to beat\nI ain't cheap but don't sell me a dream, I don't sleep\nI'm Paid in Full, so save the bull\nThis ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave ya tool\nYou feel sure, and you want more, then wipe your sweat\n'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get\n'Cause when I came in the door\nSteppin' hard enough to shake the floor\nI just started, but the others can't make no more\nRunnin' out of beats, breaks and out of time\nIf I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes\nI prove records don't have to be long\nIf it's understood and the story is strong\nYou can speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners\nThe people is peepless, it's to the listeners\n\n[Verse 2: Rakim]\nI'm the Lord, for somethin' you can absorb\nTry and control and be cautious, but the cuts and the chords\nMake me deeper than down, I make the crowd crowd around\nPeople are peepless, 'cause the soloist found\nPhrases, thoughts, made by the R of course\nOne thing I do is keep 'em different, and far from yours\nYou keep talkin', when will all the damage be done?\nYou say you're rulin' but when I'm in the place, you don't come\nMaybe you're waitin', to see what I'm makin'\nOne more style gets taken, then I'mma be breakin'\nInto patterns and pauses, piano is soft\nBut make it hard for you to start where I left off\nYou find yourself lost 'til the point is across\nYou hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit pause\nI set the scene, first you hear mixin'\nThen the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin'?\nPay close attention, never before mentioned\nListen up, I got a brand new invention\nMade from a musician, its notes are played crisp\nBut listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc\nCopywritten but still bitten, they almost sound like\nAlmost pumpin', but it ain't down like\nA record's supposed to sound, watch as it go around\nRecords are broken, smashed into the ground\nThat ain't My Melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me\nOthers are trying to flow smooth and steadily\nPotholes are left in my path then I crash and bruise\nWhoever refuse and cruise right past 'em\n'Cause I just left to do it for easy whatever\nDeath, 'til I get back you better stay in step\nAt the speakers you'll stare, if I was there, your description is\nLetters full of poetical messages, this is for the listeners", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b590ab143a3ba007bcb44a5bd6af57b.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
