[her germ where you find this weed at?]\nBlanket of black on my back... i feel safe in the darkness. [ got the boy blunted here]\n[That purple gotta love that purple]\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nI get blowed then melt in to the chair\nBlow a L up in the air eyes are red but i don't care\nRight now i prolly shouldn't be spitting\nCause' I'm lifted and mixing up my diction\nI'm feeling high like the top of a water tower\nCop a sour then its gone in an hour\nHeavily medicated sedated and faded relaxed chasin' an oasis\nIm in a safe haven free from any trouble\nStumble damn this kush got me seeing double need not fumble\nGot to keep my head straight cause' I stay putting haters in the check mate\nNow I'm way pass blowed purple weed got me feeling on my own\nAin't nothing like a purpie the type to keep a nerd high\nGot me coughin' up the lung like its my first time\nMetaphors and similes from Ecuador to Italy\nBack in 5th grade when i lost my weed virginity\nSmoking like chimney blowing out a\nCloud this purple last kush be stinking up my house\n\n[Hook: Girl singing] 2 am the silent twilight... [man i love when she sings like this right? Go head girl!]\nThe purple high light [with that purple] ..of the twilight, [Get high]\nWrap.. the night around me..\nBlanket of black on my back... i feel safe in the darkness\n\n[ so y'all can ash your blunts now roll up another]\nBlanket of black on my back... i feel safe in the darkness\n[I like that germ .. I'm out I'm out I'm out haha.]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
