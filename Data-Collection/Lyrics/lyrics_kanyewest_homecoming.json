Chi city!\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then? (Yeah)\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)\n-Min' home again\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nI met this girl when I was three years old\nAnd what I loved most, she had so much soul\nShe said, \"Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me\nBut my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.\"\nAnd from that point, I never blow her off\nNiggas come from out of town, I like to show her off\nThey like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off\nAnd make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft\nAnd when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown\nIn the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'\nI told her in my heart is where she'll always be\nShe never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave\nShe said, \"It felt like they walked and drove on me.\"\nKnew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me\nI guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me\nShe said, \"'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!\"\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nBut if you really cared for her\nThen you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams\nSometimes I still talk to her\nBut when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me\nShe said, \"You left your kids, and they just like you\nThey wanna rap and make soul beats just like you\nBut they just not you,\" and I just got through\nTalkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new\nNow everybody got the game figured out all wrong\nI guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone\nI guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home\nAnd guess when I heard that? When I was back home\nEvery interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud\nReach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud\nJump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around\nIf you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNw I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nLoyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh\nComin' home again\nLoyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh\nComin' home again\nMaybe we can start again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75a557af6e76c7479eaba6843036f855.600x600x1.png"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
