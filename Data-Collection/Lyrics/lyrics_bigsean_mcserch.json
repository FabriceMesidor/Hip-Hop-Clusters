Music\"\nIt was mad cool and my wife and kids were with me\nAnd my wife turns to me, she goes, \"Who's that?\"\nI said, \"Oh, it's Big Sean, you know, he's signed to Kanye\"\nShe said, \"Wow, he's a good kid\"\nI was like, \"Yeah, nah, definitely a grown man\"\nAnd then he comes to the show and he's just- he killed it\nHe kills it off the head, he kills it free-styled\nYou know, it just shows why he was signed\nWhy Kanye signed him, man, he's a good dude\nAnd I really hope he has the impact I believe he's gonna have\nIn upcoming years, in this-this culture\nAnd in hip hop, so make sure you pay attention\n\n[Outro: MC Serch]\nPress play, press play", "image": "https://images.genius.com/35094fe912ce98af36fb55bca8412d23.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
