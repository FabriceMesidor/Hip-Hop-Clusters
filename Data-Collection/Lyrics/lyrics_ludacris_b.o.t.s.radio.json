Whatever Happened To..?\n\n(Exactly, that's just what she need to hear)\n\n[Interlude]\nYou damn right playa, aight thank you for callin man\nNext caller\nYeah I hear you but let's talk about the fake-ass brothers\nWith the 24's but can't pay the note on they lease\nAnd my nigga with his iced-out chain\nBut I can't get him to pay his damn child support\nThat's why we makin mo' money, ownin our own property and ride just as nice\nSo now, I guess if we want to, we can bail y'all too now, huh?\nInteresting, Shawnna you wanna speak on this one?\n\n[Verse 2: Shawnna]\nUhh, yo, get your mind right niggas get a bitch that can keep up wit'chu\nI'm tired of thinkin to myself why in the hell did I ever fuck wit'chu\nI'm stuck wit'chu, sick of yo' childish games and all the stuff you do\nI'll probably mention yo' name but true to the game I've had enough of you\nI've seen yo' type befo', throwin yo' funds all over the flo'\nHe flashin his chains and flashin his dough, he drinkin the fifths and drinkin the Mo'\nBut what you don't know this nigga broke, he can't even afford to smoke\nAnd back in the hood all the hustlers and G's know he's a joke\nThat's why I cheat a nigga, just when he eat it I tell him beat it nigga\nReal bitches true to the game, that's how you G a nigga\nDTP stay in the zone, like we on PCP\nChrome on the SS, Shawnna blow there recently\nY'all niggas ain't on my level, I do it so hood\nPineapple and Belve', we feelin' so good\nLightning is so wood, I get my own stack\nThat's why I leave him 200 and never call back\n\n(That's right Shawnna, pussy rule the world!)\n\n[Interlude]\nYes it does, next caller what's up?\nMan what's up, this is Marcus\nI wanna know do y'all got somebody to talk to these triflin-ass women?\nLike me, I'm a good man, but all these good men get treated like shit!\nAll friends callin at 3:30 in the mornin\nMarcus don't wanna talk about no numbers\nMarcus wanna talk about that ass, and I ain't havin it!\nY'all got somebody to talk to these women?\nCause they need to be TAUGHT!\nI-20 you better talk to 'em!\n\n[Verse 3: I-20]\nYo, get your money right ladies, tell the man to get gone\nBut you don't you show up to my crib with your period on\nThis is lesson one baby, listen, how should I begin?\nUm, ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend\nYou're lying to yourself if you don't think you want mo'\nSo don't you call me insecure when he show up at your do'\nYou all claim to have substance, self-respect and some class\nBut half naked in the club and steady shakin yo' ass\nScreamin I ain't done enough to touch you under your skirt\nBut who the hell are you to tell me what my money is worth?\nI run the streets, and you trippin I don't make you feel safe\nI stay at home and you complainin that I think we need space\nI'm not sayin that it's fair but it's the way that it is\nAin't no nigga tryin to marry you with four or five kids\nIt may sound a little harsh but it's straight from the heart\nA nigga didn't write the scripts so I'm just doin my part, yeah\n\n(Preach my brother, preach! I hope you women out there heard that!)\n\n[Outro]\nAnd you better believe they did, it's millions of people listening\nBut that's our show for this evening ladies and gentlemen\nI gotta go get a piece of ass my damn self, alright?
