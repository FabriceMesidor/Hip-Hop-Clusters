Then let me reiterate\nBoy I'm hustla, throw one of them knuckles up\nWalk in the restaurant, hand on your jugular\nRide in that BM better buckle up\nBack game crumbling, bricks gon' double up\nI tee off hoes, look how my putter up\nOld folks say I cut her off lil sum sum\nOnly one champion and you're the runner up\nCoo coo for cocoa puffs, watch when I perch him up\nD O C, guzzlin' Hennessy\nFuck the club nigga and fuck securityyy\n\nNow when I do a show\nI rely on my gros to pick me up off the flo'\n(Fuck Da Security)\nBecause I'm too high and drunk from jumpin' up in the crowd\nSecurity like \"fuck you yo!\"\n(Fuck Da Security)\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65aa1591ac947b9397141766462ac089.465x465x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Redman"}
