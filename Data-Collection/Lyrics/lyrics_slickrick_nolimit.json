McQueen was the goat\nBut you don't like what I wrote\nThen take a lap with him\nLightning strike in a flash and its actually just my heart within a lapse again\nIt's pounding out my chest, I ran a lap on this, I'm after this\nBar that they claim is higher than a mountain ridge to push it out the atmosphere and fly around the solar system blasphemous", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6362695d2cd81936f78d7fead84c50db.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Slick Rick"}
