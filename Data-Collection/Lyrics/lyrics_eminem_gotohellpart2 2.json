You go to hell\" -] Mr. Garrison\n\nVerse One [Eminem]:\nYo\nAt birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth\nThe first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt\nMom wouldn't take me\nThe bitch still hates me\nShit, one day she said, \"Go rake leaves,\"\nI said, \"Make me!\"\nI'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid\nWho was kicked out of his house\nFor making fart sounds with his mouth\nArguing with me and mom was on-going\nShe called law enforcement when I broke the law mower\nThe slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen\nI went to start it and it screamed, \"Please fix me!\"\nBack then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince\nAnd him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then\nI decided to cut class to rap full time\nAnd get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme\nAnybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick\nCome and see me, see if I don't live up to this image\nYou fuckin' pricks!\n\nScratching:\n\n\"No...you hear me! You go to hell\" -] Mr. Garrison\n\nVerse Two [Obie Trice]:\nHow the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes\nWith one gat and a wack stack of flows?\nA whole lot of lip\nThicker than Obie's shit\nOh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean\nBody part corroded\nCast away\nYou stretched in a cast today\nThat's how a real bastard play\nDo shit the bachelor way\nCreek niggas will blast away\nY'all niggas ain't tough\nY'all niggas funny\nY'all need to roll on WB 20\nNiggas think they 2Pacalypse Now\nUntil they catch a buckshot\nChicken pop a nigga's style\nNiggas scared of the firm\nSlim, Dirty Dozen and Trice\nCome back like thieves in the night\nNiggas jump, that's reason to fight\nThat's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right\nMotherfucker", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
