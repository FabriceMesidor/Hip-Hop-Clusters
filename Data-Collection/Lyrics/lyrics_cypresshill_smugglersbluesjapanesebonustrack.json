(yeeah!)\nI'm holding weight every 30 days, business pays\nSo many ways many methods of moving my white haze!\nI got the cellophane, hiii! - Get this money tonite!\nI got the shipment goin' out. - Got to be air tight!\nSo when you fuck around (around!) - no time for me to fuck around (take that shit off!)\nI got the ballin' niggas waitin' on me at the compound! (compound!)\nSo get the trucks ready! - And let's hit the back roads\nTo scam this motherfuckin' ass border patrol!\nI got my cousin Huey paid - for lookin' away\nBack on the 405 on the way to L.A.! (way to L.A.!)\nI'm multiplyin' in my head - just how much stash\nIt's gonna take for me to double and triple up all my cash!\nI hit the city limits, time for me - to check myself!\nCause I don't wanna sit inside no fuckin' cell! (no fuckin' cell!)\nSlope the rolls - down, hold - down; I see the gate\nSo I'm pullin' up! - And I hope these fools ain't late\nOr I'm outta here; wait, no! I see them in the rear\nWith 3 or 4 fools holding 2's in the real!\nI got the double barrel shit - hidden under my coat\nFor any crazy eyed motherfucker rockin' the boat!\nI got the big boss hoss, just sippin' the sauce\nYou got the shit? You got the money? Then break the shit off!\nCheck out the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)\nBright and early in the mornin'! (smuggler...)\nThis is for the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)\nI know the DEA is waitin'! (smuggler...)\nTake out the herb, man smuggliiiin'! (smuggler...)\nIt's my ass that I'm risking! (smuggler...)\nThis is for the herb, man sumggliiiin' (smuggler...)\nI know it's your daily liven'! (smuggler...)\nI came a long, long way - from slangin' the herb\nSometimes I think about - when I was kickin it to the curb!\nNow it's dirt in my pocket but - shit done changed!\nTatoos on my body and - fat gold chains!\nI got the mega-shipment - that must go out\nOn the same route me and my cousins started out!\nHead back to Mexico for a friend of mine\nWe're gonna bring this shit load back; 4-0 pounds!\nIt's like crack rock! - Cause we done this shit before\nNow I loaded up the stash on the hollow floor\nDouble checkin' everything; now it all looks cool!\nNow we rollin' to the border like we used to do\nWe pulled up at the border, but something was wrong\nI began to realize that the swoop was on!\nI had the DEA and immigration closin' in They had dogs all around my shit! - No way to win! They lookin in the truck, now I know the shit's for blast\nDEA agent sayin': \"Now I got your ass! \"\nIt's been a long time smugglin. - now I'm done!\nIt's all over now! It's lookin' like I'm Audi, son. (like I'm Audi, son!)\n\"Now I'm headed up the river with the boat and no pad-dle! (smuggler...)\nAnd they got me in lock dooooown... \" (smuggler...)\nBig up to the herb, man smuggliiiiin'! (smuggler...)\nNow they got me in lock dooown...\nPeace to the herb, man smuggliiiiin'! (smuggler...)\nNow they got me in lock dooown...\nRespect to the herb, man smuggliiiiin'! (smuggler...)\nNow they got me in lock dooown...\nWhat's up to the herb, man smuggliiiiin'? (smuggler...)\nNow they got me in lock dooown...\nYo, this goes out to all the Buddha slangers!\nAll the Earth smugglers!
