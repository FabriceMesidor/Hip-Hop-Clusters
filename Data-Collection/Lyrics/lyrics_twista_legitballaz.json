{"songs": [{"title": "Legit Ballaz", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Feel the heat from our gunfire, when you see us coming\nTheir your niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass\nCome up out the trunk so fast\nY'all will get murdered when the pump go blast\nSet this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome\nSmokin' blow in the zone\nKicking up more shit than a broken bone\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' money\nGetting down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody\n\nHavn't you heard off these muderous cats, ballin' for scratch\nNiggas shootin' nervous with gats, so hot we circle this drought\nI drops them hollows, shots to swallow, my motto be \"fuck tommorow\"\nSorrows improbable\nIn Chicago motherfucker, bones get fractured, crumble like crackers\nRush the stage, allow the crowd to witness your massacre\nYou ain't bone, you're marrow, the lead travels from barrels\nBloody apperal, unravvle, chances is narrow\nThugs get judged when I drop slugs like gavels\nEmbarrassed and baffled\nGot people and cattle getting slaughtered in battles\nIn gang land, we bang and ride, vibed gettin' high\nAin't no explaining, represcussions if you don't comply\nGet ready motherfucker, my city's full of brothers who struggle\nBreed's, T's, I's, U's, C's, Four Corner Hustlers\nBlack souls, magic kings and if gats could sing\nMy lyrics squeeze desert ease will rock you to sleep\n\nFeel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming\nMaking niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass\nCome up out the trunk so fast\nY'all will get murdered when the pump go blast\nSet this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome\nSmokin' blow in the zone\nKicking up more shit than a broken bone\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' water\nWhen y'all come up shorter\nTry to come at the mob and get your body slaughtered\n\nI got love for all niggas yelling out \"fuck the police\"\nI'm a Jeffery Manor Gangsta wit' the mobsta elites\nLegit Ballers the family 'til the day that I die\nThey let the south and the westside hook up in the city of Chi'\nLettin' off rounds, fifty rounds, 'bout to shut you bitches down\nFrom the Manor in that K-Town, I say it's too late now\nFor you niggas that hate now, better stay out my way now\nBefore you end up facedown\nYou motherfuckers don't know a thang about me\nI roll wit' G's from Cabrini down to the Ida B's\nLakeside, 9-Tre, the Long City\nWild Hundreds got love for that nigga Nitty\nGive me room when my adrenaline rushing\nCause if I go in that trunk, you know I'm 'bout to start dumping\nYou hear the cries as the bullets fly by\nAnd in the end that motherfucker died\n\nFeel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming\nMaking niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass\nCome up out the trunk so fast\nY'all will get murdered when the pump go blast\nSet this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome\nSmokin' blow in the zone\nKicking up more shit than a broken bone\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, steady stackin' money\nGettin' down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody\n\nHungry, I was lookin' for the fetti', ready\nWith the mental that was heavy, now her niggas ain't ready\nFuck the Navigator, we was filling holes in that 87' Chevy\nSitting on thirty-thirties\nSelling leaf and syrup on the corner trying to stir this\nHad a strap with the handle that was pearly\nUp early, (?)\nKnow the game don't scare me, competition better flury or get buried\nEither scuffle or scurry, brother hunt the word down\nIf you want a piece better hurry\nGot off our knees and putting arrows on our tip\nBut there's really no need for you to say we ain't shit\nGot up the cheese by telling motherfuckers freeze, and run in their cribs\nNow we like to ball legit\nGot to get up off the gold and the dick\nRoll with a clique of hustlers thats strugglin'\nPistol bustin' and mean muggin'\nGet up out the way my armored heavy family huntin'\nCause ain't nothin' gonna stop us from rollin'\nRap flow and the strap holdin', tired of feeling like I'm closed in\nIn the back, roll in on my ass when we got going\nOut the back door like smoking\nAnd tripping on the brink of success or failure\nMomma, I can't call when I'm caught in the thin line\nAnd it's kinda hard to tell ya'\nBut on the blood of my city, I'm a' keep crawling up the barbed wire\nHold your guns higher, cause ain't none higher\n\nFeel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming\nMaking niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass\nCome up out the trunk so fast\nY'all will get murdered when the pump go blast\nSet this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome\nSmokin' blow in the zone\nKicking up more shit than a broken bone\nDon't fuck with a legit baller, steady stacking bread\nAnd be ready for the armageddon\nTry to come at the mob and get your body deadened", "image":
