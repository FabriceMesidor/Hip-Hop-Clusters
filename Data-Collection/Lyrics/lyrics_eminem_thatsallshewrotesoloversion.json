Bitch, you're already bi-polar\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, I don't really care what you call me\nYou can even call me cold\nThese bitches knew as soon as they saw me\nIt's never me they'll get the privilege to know\nI roll like a desperado\nNow I never know where I'm gonna go\nStill I ball like there's no tomorrow\nUntil it's over and that's all she wrote\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nTIP told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you\nIs never to let these tricks trick you\nMighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit\nDig you, ho? Take a shovel and dig you some dignity, bitch!\nShit, you talk about some advice that sticks with you\nIf I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns\nLike double stick, it's you, but fuck \u2018em, TIP, it's cool\nI'm chillin' like a villain\nLike the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eating fudgesicles\nI\u2019d rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you\nBefore I tie the fuckin' knot I\u2019d tie you in one, bitch\nYou think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin' dumb is you?\nI\u2019ll give you some lumps before I split some lump sums with you\nSo here\u2019s a penny for your thoughts\nBut it won\u2019t buy you a cheeseburger\nBut a nickel might just get you one pickle\nFuck it, it's official, so blow the whistle, I got a trust issue\nThere's a bombshell: Scud missile\nLike I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you\nLike before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut, this'll\nTeach you not to come drunk stumbling my way, for shizzle\nI still live like I budget a Gilbert's Lodge check stub, bizzle\nSo fuck Sizzler! These checkers are bust like a blood blister\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, I don't really care what you call me\nYou can even call me cold\nThese bitches knew as soon as they saw me\nIt's never me they'll get the privilege to know\nI roll like a desperado\nNow I never know where I'm gonna go\nStill I ball like there's no tomorrow\nUntil it's over and that's all she wrote\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nYeah, I guess life is a bitch \u2013 ain\u2019t it, TIP?\nAnd each one thinks they the shit\nShirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief\nI\u2019m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine\nLet 'em get a good taste of it\nI\u2019m sure you got that relationship memo by now\nBut in case you didn't, I\u2019ll stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it\nLife is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it\nSo I pace this shit a little bit quicker; that clock, I'm racin' it\nDouble timin' it, but I still spit triple the amount of insults\nIn a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks\nTo catch on; while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong\nMan, I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe \"S\" on it, dog\nAnd they say McDonalds isn\u2019t a restaurant, well, I guess I\u2019m wrong\nBut if you gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot\nFor the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, I don't really care what you call me\nYou can even call me cold\nThese bitches knew as soon as they saw me\nIt's never me they'll get the privilege to know\nI roll like a desperado\nNow I never know where I'm gonna go\nStill I ball like there's no tomorrow\nUntil it's over and that's all she wrote\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nAll she wrote, all she wrote\nI said it's over and that's all she wrote\nAll she wrote, all she wrote\nYeah, goodnight, it\u2019s over\nAnd that's all she wrote", "image": "https://images.genius.com/94b630cec122c522ed3236a7878aad80.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
