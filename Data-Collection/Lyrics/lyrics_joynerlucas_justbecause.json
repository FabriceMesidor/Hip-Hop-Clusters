called just because?\nSaid hello just because?\nWhen's the last time we got drunk just because?\nWhen's the last time that we fucked just because?\nYou promised you won't change up just because?\nI know you work in the morning\nBut tonight girl we should stay up just because\nPop some champagne in the tub just because\n\n[Verse 1]\nI said when's the last time we made love just because?\nJust cause we ain't got shit to do\nLately you been so predictable\nI just need, I just need someone to listen to\nDamnit, I miss when you strip for no reason\nI mean just for no reason\nShopping and buying me gifts for no reason\nNow all you do is throw fists for no reason\nThat shit's so depressing, I miss how it used to be\nNow you just got used to me\nUsed to how usually you get when I'm in your space\nNow it don't feel like our vibe is the same\nI think we so routine, it's disgustin'\nLately girl, we been so structured\nI mean how can we be so reluctant\nI just want the same person I fell in love with\n\n[Chorus]\nCause when's the last time that you called just because?\nSay hello just because?\nWhen's the last time we got drunk just because?\nWhen's the last time that we fucked just because?\nI promise I won't change us just because\nLet's be real just because\nChef up a meal in yo heels just because\nThrow on some Netflix and chill just because\nTell me when's the last time we went out just because?\nLeft the house just because?\nWhen's the last time I went down just because?\nWhen's the last time you got loud just because?\nTell me when's last time I said I'm proud just because?\nMake you smile just because?\nAct like some kids and play house just because\nThrow on some jams and get loud just because\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust cause you're special, don't let your job get the best of you\nThat's when you get the best of me\nI feel we ain't been connecting mentally\nI hope that you don't think any less of me\nDammit, I miss when you strip for no reason (just because)\nI mean just for no reason\nShowers at night, candles lit on some sweet shit\nNow all we do is throw fists for no reason\nThat shit's so depressing, I blame myself, maybe it's my fault\nFuck it girl, just take your top off\nThat make up sex, wake up next morning and hop on that spaceship\nCruise all of the places that got lost in translation\nLet's take your mind off it\nLately girl we been so structured\nI'm so in love, I just need you to trust it\nYou just want the same person you fell in love with\n\n[Chorus]\nCause when's the last time that I called just because?\nAnd said hello just because?\nWhen's the last time we got drunk just because?\nWhen's the last time that we fucked just because?\nI promise I won't change up just because\nYou know I work in the morning\nBut tonight girl, we should stay up just because\nPop some champagne in the tub just because\nHold up, when's the last time we went out just because?\nLeft the house just because?\nWhen's the last time I went down just because?\nWhen's the last time you got loud just because?\nBaby, when's the last time I, hehe (just because)\nMake you smile, just because\nAct like some kids and play house just because\nThrow on some jams and get down just because\nJust cause, I love you\n\n[Bridge]\nNo, smoke, damn\nI just, wanna, vibe\nWanna, ride, we get, ghost, yeah\nPour it, drink it, coast, yeah\nNo,
