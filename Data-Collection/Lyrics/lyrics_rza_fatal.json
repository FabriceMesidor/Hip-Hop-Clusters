Ready to die\nI was born ready, motherfucker\nDaywalker, daywalker\nDaywalker, daywalker\n\n[RZA]\nYo... Yo, yo\nIt's the feast of the blood with sin, unleash the beast within\nI walk around, with the strength of a hundred men\nYou best be gone before I count to ten\nBlood dripping from my canine, like a fountain pen\nIt seems I've been asleep for a thousand years\nThe way my world has changed, it brings me a thousand tears\nPrince of darkness, they walk through the rays of light\nTo this breed of vampire, I'm the prototype\nThe shape shifting, mirror image, flash phototype\nTo everlast, an original red blood O type\n\"He was born perfect, and just like the great white shark, this guy has never had to evolve\"\n\nDaywalker, daywalker\nDaywalker, daywalker\nDaywalker, daywalker\nDaywalker, daywalker\n\n[Hook: RZA]\nTry to use my name, that's fatal\nTried to claim my fame but that's fatal\nAbout to bring the pain, that's fatal\nBite through your jugular vein, that's fatal\n\nTry to use my name, that's fatal\nTried to claim my fame but that's fatal\nAbout to bring the pain, that's fatal\nBite through your jugular vein, that's fatal\n\nDaywalker, daywalker\nDaywalker, daywalker\n\n[Bridge: RZA]\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\nCome on, walk with me\n\n\"You're not immortal, I must of heard hundreds of rodents make the same claim, and each one of them tasted the bitter end of my sword\"\n\n[RZA]\nI strike back with a vengeance, the father of descendents\nAnd I can't be deflected, by your silver cross pendants\nBlow the holy water, you make the false images\nOne swing from the sickle, ahh, your life diminishes\nSting like the scorpion, strike with the force of ten\nMy blood is known to revitalize corpse of men\nIn the last days, they said the dead would walk again\nThe blind, deaf and the dumb will talk again\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ff66b49bd35a1039f37f5bd05d9bb29d.300x444x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
