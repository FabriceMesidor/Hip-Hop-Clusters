My son, the star will be my resurrection.\"\nI didn't know I would have kids at all when I wrote at 20\nSome years ago, I had a daughter then I had a son just like\nI setted that rhyme\nYou put down stuff on that paper, you'd be surprised\nThe atmosphere reads it, the universe reads it\nAnd hears it, they can hear our thoughts, this universe\nBe careful what you're thinking because it doesn't know how to differentiate what you mean with those thoughts\nIt will\u2014it will give it to you though\nI was blessed, I was lucky with that\n\n[Chorus]\n(It's yours)\n(it's\u2014it's\u2014it's\u2014it's yours)\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nI sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged\nWritin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin\nBehold the mic I'm throbbin', my movement\nUnderstandable smooth shit that murderers move with\nThe thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right\nThe fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe\nThe mind activation, react like I'm facin'\nTime like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'\nWipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets\nRalph Lauren on my feet makes my cipher complete\nWhether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep\nI can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep\nI keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)\nPresident Barack Obama, he represents me\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nThe world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nCan you believe it?\nIt's your world, it's yours\nIt's mine\u2014it's\nCan you believe it?\nI said the world is yours\nBelieve it, yeah\n\n[Bridge: Nas]\nTo my man Ill Will (God bless your life)\nTo my people right here (bless your life)\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI trip, we box up crazy bitches\nAimin' guns in all my baby pictures\nBeef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's\nYet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul\nThe versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child\nDwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled\nOr caught by the devil's lasso\nThere's no days for broke days\nWe sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray\nSoakin' their sins in trays of holy water\nOdds against Nas are slaughter\nThinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter\nMy strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection\nBorn in correction, all the wrong shit I did\nHe'll lead a right direction\nHow you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre\nYou flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?\nWhat you are soldier? I thought I told ya\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nIt's mine, it's mine (the world)\nThe world, the world, up top\nIt's your world\nIt's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours, uh\n\n[Interlude: Nas]\nBreak it down\nWatch what you say\nWatch what you listen to\nI've been listening lately and a lot of these days ain't real\nIf I may say so myself\nAlright, check it\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nI'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed\nFor murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded\nBorn alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne\nI'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home\nI need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow\n\u2018Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow\nTryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip\nPicturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip\nAnd I'm amped up, they locked the champ up\nRemember that Mike Tyson back in the days?\nStabbin' women like the Phantom\nThe crew is lampin', Big Willie style\nCheck the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild\nStash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge\nWalk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames\nPlus the games people play bust the problems of the world today\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\n(It's yours) Oh, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world?\nI said the world is yours, the world is yours\nWhose world? It's yours\nWhose world? I said the world is yours, the world is yours\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nTo my Queens' crew, the foundation\nThe world is yours\nTo my people in B-more\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nTo my people in VA\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nAnd the nation capital, you know the world is yours\nThe world is yours\nOh, da-da-da da-da-da\nSmooth it out like that, da-da-da da-da-da\n\n[Spoken: Nas]\nThank you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9fb8160b2c6d56c5e7237de79281fbdc.807x807x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
