And I don't even care\nCreep low, weed smoke's in the air\nEverywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes\nWaitin' for niggas at the end of every show\nI just seen you in my friend's video\nI never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go\nFollow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through\nIt's all about you, yeah, nigga, it's all about you\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho'\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same ho'\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nI see you struttin' in your miniskirt\nA crooked smile with a heart that did plenty dirt\nWill it work with your ass as you pass me by?\nSayin' \"hey,\" I've been looking at you smile all day, let's parlay\nDrinkin' liquor, kissin' to help you know me quicker\nWhile I keep workin' on your zipper, my tongue kissin'\nIn your position I'm fortified to do the mission\nMove your hips and groove to this\nToo many cooks in the kitchen, nobody take the time to listen\nThey probably think we still dissin'\nWit' your permission, I can make you scream my name\nI'm a real man, guide you through the sleazy game\nFollow me, let me take you to the ecstasy\nYou'll have the time of your life when you next to me you'll see\nAin't no way they can stop me\nWhen I know a true thug woman got me\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg & 2Pac]\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nIt's all about you\nNo matter where I go, I see the same..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbbdb7f208d5866d896da3ccaf431d59.681x681x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
