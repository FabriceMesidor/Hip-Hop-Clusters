And where my stash at??\nI mean, where the Dow Jones, where the Nas-Daq?\nI do it for the little macs, with their caps back\nMy little niggas pumpin' crack, out they napsack\nKnow what I mean? Get the sticky cream, pass that\nI smoke bitches, can't nicotine patch that\nDon't need your spot, to get a good game\nCause a shot is a shot, if you got a good aim\n\n[Hook: Nicki Minaj]\nIt's been a long time coming, but I came\nNow everybody in the rap game know my name\nBut honey ain't a damn thing funny when your fame\nOutweighs your change, outweighs your change (x2)\n\n[Verse 2: Ransom]\nWe on the road to riches, I'm fucking loads of bitches\nI'm playing with you mama, Nicki, she's so suspicious\nMy little golden mistress, for her, I load them biscuits\nYeah I roll with Nicholas, we so explicit, you won't resist it\nIt's been a long time coming, but you don't know specifics\nNo more phony wishes, we ready, cause now we know the business\nCome holla at your guy, I always make it pour\nInvite me to ya wedding, I throw dollars at the bride\nIt's dirty money, dirty jeans, and dirty scullies\nYou heard he funny, but chill, I'm still absurdly gully\nMost of these rappers lost, it's no cash at all\nIf I knew this back then, I'da just played basketball\nOr maybe not, they say that I never pass the ball\nIf there's no cash involved, baby I'mma laugh it off\n\n[Hook: Nicki Minaj]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6723f478cff14a2ba2cbe0ce2ad7d4c2.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
