Prince]\nAww, yeah\nFree at last, free at last\nThank the God Almighty, once again, I'm sucka free at last\nYo 'Face, I'm gonna take a little longer on this intro\nSo I can shine the spotlight on these roaches and rats\nSo let me say to you homies, there's a conspiracy to destroy all Black entrepenuaers, in hip hop, by rat niggas and law enforcement\nSo let me begin with rat number 1, in Houston, Bookman\nNow this guy sued me, went on tv, to show off his pumpkin head and swollen eyes\nAnd then the police filed assault on me, misdemeanor, offered me 6 months probation\nI told them no, so they made it a felony, and told me it carries from 2 to 20\nSo the judge say \"what are y'all offering Mr. Prince\" and the DA, Badheart, who not even a prosecutor in the court room, but since he has his obsession with destroying me, he yells \"10 years\"\nSo I told my Lawyer, Ken Schafer, \"You tell him to do it, or lets go to war\"\nSo the war begun, and  the target number one was Bookman. And he told on everybody, Johnny binder, Harry Ole and even himself\nI never saw a man sit and tell on himself, money fraud, tax evasion and then put the roach and the rat who is helping him, Binder and Harry Ole, in the grease\nNow, I'm almost through, but the shit gets deeper\nBecause right about the time Bookman battleship is about to sink, and my case dismissed,  the DA Good-I mean-Bad Heart claims someone called his wife at home, and my name called on his caller ID\nSo I hired a man, investigator, got the number and it was a crooked phone, in my name\nBut a bogus address, and no other information\nNow for y'all who know, I was born at night, but last night\nSo who knows who has access to DA's home and mobile number\nYo Face, there's a lot of racism in Harris County, DA office\nThat's out to destroy our black leaders\nYo Face, I smell a set up, from Schumaker\nSo drop some heat for my boy Roy Jones, who trains to your music\nEarl, who stood like a soldier for my case\nAnd Fred who told the truth\nAnd to all my peeps who stood and rode with me from day 1\nI'm still that nigga, raw with no cut\nYo face, you know the homie Little Pots is still doin 12 years behind this clown\nSo let's expose this snitch nigga, Lil Troy, paper work\n\n[Outro: Scarface]\nI am Face, and I approve this message", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6976a10236f881255b574212a02ae481.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
