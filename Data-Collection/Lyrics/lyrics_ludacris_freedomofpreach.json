repeat 2X, minus ad libs\n\n[Outro: Bishop Eddie Lee Long]\nWhat you just heard is real life\nIt's real life for you, it's real life for many\nIt's about where you been, yet at the same time you\nAy, you find yourself, in the midst of conflict and turmoil\nYes I'm talkin' to you, in the midst of conflict and turmoil\nCause you realize HEY - it's, time to change right now\nAnd in the middle of that I wanna say this\nThe Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child\nI understood as a child, I fought as a child\nHey, but when I became a man\nI put away those, childish things\nDid you not know that your environment has shaped you?\nWhere you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes\nIn the upper downtown, wherever it was\nThe people around you, the things around you\nCause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn\nBut what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book\nGod called you a prophet\nWhen you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out\nAnd it commands attention, it commands change\nI'm talking about the power, that's inside of you\nAnd in the midst when you're, starting to understand\nThat I caught the wrong message, and now it's time\nI'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God\nHe said, \"Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation\"\nOld things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold\nEverything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you\nIt's time to stop the killing\nI said it's time to stop the stealing\nIt's time to stop disrespecting our women\nIt's time for us to come home and raise our children\nIt's time for us, to really mould our communities\nIt's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion\nBut to get hooked up in relationship, with God\nAnd the amazing thing about it\nIs wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess\nAnd you can tell God \"I'm sorry;\nI had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing\nI was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right\nAnd now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me\nAnd I may have done the things, that they said I did\nBut I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be\nAnd I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments\nBut every time I fall down, I'll get right back up\nAnd every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line\nBecause I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!\"\nYou can't resist the change\nAnd you're not condemned by your yesterday\nIf you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny\nMove, change, and be, now!\n\n[Hook Three: sung by choir]\nSearchin' so long, lost in the clouds\nTryin' to stay strong, and make you proud - make you proud!\nTook me some time (took me some time) now I see\nHe resides (He resides) in me (in me yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57825a3687491fdf0e3c4c58b1b7aee5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
