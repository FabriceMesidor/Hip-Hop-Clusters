(laugh)\n\nRaider Nation (Let's Go Let's Go)\nRaider Nation (Let's Go Let's Go)\nRaider Nation, Are you ready for some football?\nYou ain't ready for the football!\n\nYou ain't ready for them Oakland Raiders\nIt's the invasion of them Oakland Raiders\nAre you ready for this football?\nYou ain't ready for this football. (ahhh)\n\nHere we come baby, just win baby\nFeel the storm of the cold autumn wind baby\nIt's the Oakland Raiders get cha mouthpiece\nYou in the black hole with the black beast\nThe same black gold, this is black silver\nCommitment to excellence we deliver\nAnd we'll play past regulation\nIt's the invasion of the Raider nation\n\n[Hook]\n\nYou ain't ready for them Oakland Raiders\nIt's the invasion of them Oakland Raiders\n\nAre you ready for this football?\nYou ain't ready for this football. (ahhh)\n\nThe Raider nation is united\nWhen they see them pirates the fans get excited\nThe opposition get cryin'\nWhen I hit the field\nWith my eye patch and my shield\nThe silver & black will attack\n(are you ready for some football)\nThe silver & black will attack\n(are you ready for some football)\n\nRaider Nation, Let's Go Let's Go(4x)\nRaider Nation, We are We are (4x)\nRaider Nation\nJust Win Baby (8x)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c457bbdb72f694aa2707c388b36e7230.960x764x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice Cube"}
