[What you know?]\nWhat do I show? [What you show?]\nCapitvating lyrical flow!\n[They don't play it on radio!]\nYeah, but the spirit know\nBut only a few can hear it though\nThe metaphysical lyrical blow\nThe minute you're in it and hear it, yo\nSee the evil and clear it, yo\nSee that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles\nUh, So let the dead bury their dead\nLife is but a dream, and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed\nBetter we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived\nPray for them too, coz there grace of God kept them alive\nYes we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them\nBut what about the injured that must still rebuild again?\n\n[Hook]\nI know that the dayz ahead are dark\nBut you can shine the light that's in your heart\nYou've got-ta see yourself in victory\nThe love I give to you, you give to me\n\nI know that the dayz ahead are dark\nBut you can shine the light that's in your heart\nYou've got-ta see yourself in victory\nThe love I give to you, you give to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo all the people, that never lost someone\nConsider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son\nThese cowards slaughter and run\nAnd to know that there's more than just one\nMakes you wanna store up your gun\nAnd withdraw all the funds, but\n\n[Hook]\nI know that the dayz ahead are dark\nBut you can shine the light that's in your heart\nYou've got-ta see yourself in victory\nThe love I give to you, you give to me\n\nI know that the dayz ahead are dark\nBut you can shine the light that's in your heart\nYou've got-ta see yourself in victory\nThe respect I give to you, you give to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d84f73e1b21b8b4dbd679efa191364e4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
