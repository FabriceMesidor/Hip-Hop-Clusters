Anybody tell me?\nWhich was is up?\n\n[Verse 2: RZA]\nNow Mary, Mary on the contrary\nShe was a girl who was extraordinary\nEveryday she went to the library\nHanging out was secondary\nStacked in the back, her look was dope\nReputation clean like a bar of soap\n17, a virgin queen\nChurch going girl if you know what I mean?\nBut her best friend Lynne was full of sin\nBeen having sex since the age of 10\nInfluenced Mary within a year\n[?] expensive gear to wear\nAnd earrings to put into her ear\nMarried soon, forgot all about [?]\nIncreased her speed chug and weave\nBut instead she loves to smoke weed\nHer reputation is now filthy\nNeighborhood hooker, feeling rather guilty\nWeed smoking a blunt scratching a blunt\nAsking the question, which way is up?\n\n[Hook]\nWhich way is up?\nYo yo yo Which was is up?\nAy ay, which way is up?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0050e4b1c52ecca6d63818331b489e2a.683x683x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
