You love it when it sounds like this\nThat's why the club crowded better find you a bitch\nShe heard my name and she shouted this is me and my fifth\nAnd we both bout it bout it in a brand new six, with a smoke cloud around it\nNear the square anywhere, no sneakers on the rug\nAnd my system knockin, like the speakers in the club\nLook ma, drop the lame and spend a weekend with a thug\nI'll have you back at the cuzzi geekin of the bud\nWhen I come through I come through sparklin\nSix car garage in you in the apartment, and starvin\nI walk and talk, like I was raised around macks\nNew York native, there's a razor in the hat\nSmooth as Fillmore Slim with gators on the track\nI hit 'em, quit 'em, and dish 'em off like that\nI'm a bring her all of the jewelry cause I don't play the back\nAnd give less to spray now or later on the lac\n\n[Chorus: LL Cool J] (50 Cent)\nNow when you see me in the club (You can bump this)\nYou ballin out doin it up (You can bump this)\nThe champagne won't buss (You can bump this)\nYou wanna do it like us (You can bump this)\nNow mama after my show, come on and let's roll\nI got places to go, and money to blow\nI got the shorty so I just keep it on the low\nShhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!
