niggas like myself\nYou will not have that luxury\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nI wake up excited, I made it through the night\nThings I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?\nMy nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick\nShe keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs\nI think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fuckin' feature\nI do at least three a week, roll up the fuckin' reefer\nWent from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas\nTen chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer\nNiggas claim that they thuggin' when they dick-ridin'\nMy niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbin'\nOn the block in my all white sneakers\nLord knows in my ten Jesus pieces\nPray for me cause you know a nigga doin' wrong\nMy homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem\nCount mills for the times that we had it hard\nAskin' for a hundred mill as I pray to God\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nI do this for my niggas facin' hard times\nCan't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time\nTen chains on, Eric B with mob ties\nRakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde\nBlood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid\nQuick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives\nI pray for every soul that this music reaches\nBury me a G, ten Jesus pieces\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nYoung nigga comin' up, they wanna gun you down\nDrinkin' vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you P-Nut)\nRidin' real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)\nShoppin' for them Os when the mall close\nReppin' for your homies when they all gone\nGet empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)\nAll black tees, ten gold chains\nAt the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game\nTen years strong in the same trap\nTen years blowin' on that strong pack\nLord knows that I wanna live right\nBut Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)\nForty dollar tab meanin' forty grand\nLil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band\nHoldin' on the forty in his other hand\nTen chains on, smokin' in the motherland\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nI do this for my niggas facin' hard times\nCan't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time\nTen chains on, Eric B with mob ties\nRakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde\nBlood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid\nQuick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives\nI pray for every soul that this music reaches\nBury me a G, ten Jesus pieces\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nI'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice\nAll these jewels on, all Moissanites\nI could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster\nBlack card maxed out, damn black brother\nWhite collar, black market\nChrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket\nEight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta\nScreamin' your affiliations, but that don't matter\nI'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither\nNever blackmail a motherfuckin' killer\nOn trial and they wanna execute me\nIt's really sad, just the fact they never knew me\nTrue G to the core, feel my texture\nA true G keeps it raw in his lecture\nKeep it simple, white tee, new sneakers\nDope boy style, ten Jesus pieces\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nI do this for my niggas facin' hard times\nCan't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time\nTen chains on, Eric B with mob ties\nRakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde\nBlood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid\nQuick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives\nI pray for every soul that this music reaches\nBury me a G, ten Jesus pieces\n\n[Verse 4: Stalley]\nVersace shirt, Jesus layin' on the chest\nMan I swear Big did it the best, I mean\nNas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean\nYe did it fresh, but man Big did it the best\nAnd I was so impressed that I went and got ten\nNow I'm stuntin' on these niggas cause I couldn't back then\nRose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum\nAnd I wear them all at once, I ain't tryna match them\nI remember bumpin' Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner\nScrapin' up for a sandwich and a soda\nNow my strength is up and I'm danglin' chains off my shoulders\nBut no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed\nFor the reason that I buy em\nAnd they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine\nOr even put it in a rhyme\nIt's better things I could talk about or put my money towards\nBut for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss\n\n[Hook: Rick Ross]\nI do this for my niggas facin' hard times\nCan't be on them corners if you hustlin' part time\nTen chains on, Eric B with mob ties\nRakim flows, comin' from the Pharcyde\nBlood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid\nQuick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives\nI pray for every soul that this music reaches\nBury me a G, ten Jesus pieces\n\n[Outro: Rick Ross]\nWe untouchable\n\n[Outro Skits]\nXolaal sama guys, dundu ben yoon la\nDangay dundu sa dundu, gemm Yalla\nLigeey, xalis, gnax, amoul nelaw, gnaf\u00e8\nSa life yako dugal, ken du ko jappale\nYow ya ray sa bopp ba dee. Moy loolu\n\nMi historia es complicada, pero al final del dia valio la pena, porque ahora estoy trabajando con el jefe\n\nYo vivi en Colombia y vivi muchas cosas, me entiende?\n\nVi muertes...vi muertes...vi cuerpos en las calles, sangrando despues del colegio, con 12, 13 a\u00f1os viendo estas cosas en la calle\n\nY siempre queria venir para aqui otra vez, y me vine, y trabaje porque tenia otra mentalidad. Y cuando llegue aca entendi mi proposito: hacer dinero, ser rico para siempre\n\nDios perdona, yo no", "image": "https://images.genius.com/52547754f795d4ff94def40716ed3a2e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
