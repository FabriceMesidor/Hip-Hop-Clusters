No, I'm completely low\nI'm so low I could sell this booth as my new cellar\nI could sell a Jewish fella suit to a shrewd tailor\nWho better? I can sell a shovel to the Devil\nThen turn around and I can sell the scoop to a newsletter\nFeeling like God only kicked Moses on the snare\nAllah on the flyer and this bitch emoting on a prayer\nFuck these labels, fuck you label hoes focused on despair\nFuck radio, I'm already floating on the air\nI ain't here to be famous in debt, do my thing to me dead\nThese fans are programmed to change and forget\nIn this white man's world I'm just a black who ain't in the red\nWho hasn't had a hat he can hang on regret\nRappers kind of rapping too tame to collect\nWho has a rather insane intellect\nI would rather ride a train to success\nThat's plain than ride a dragonfly through a flame to impress\nMaybe I'm Red, maybe I'm Meth, maybe I'm less\nMaybe I'm crazy like Macy Gray, baby, I'm blessed\nThe hoes praising me like maybe I'm next\n'Cause I'm wavy, my flow Avion wet\nI'm so amazing, I'm Jay Z, I'm Treach\nI'm feeling like KRS in the flesh\nIn the 80s, but more 94' Shady I guess\nWe taking the feeling back from the wealthy, rich and shining\nUncla Murda this and Suge is more healthy for the genre\nPorsche pushing, motor whoofing\nUnder the hood it sound like horses hoofing\nI never ran from a soul, but I got promoters booking\nI keep a hand full of something to fold\nI'm just here to tell you the facts\nThe mayor slipped and fell through the cracks\nLike the quarter's is under your sofa cushion\nMan, I remember these hoes used to overlook me\nNow they come to my shows and throw their panties on stage\nOr they just say \"fuck it' and throw the pussy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2627cc5445030d64606928667383564b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
