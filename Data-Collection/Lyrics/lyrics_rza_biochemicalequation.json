Breathe into the breathalyzer\nGet out the car, please, follow this exercise, sir\nPut one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe\nWalk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road\nMy homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato\nOr cartwheels and then spin out like a tornado\nThey used to chase him, right; but son, he would always shake em\nThen come and puff bowls and make beats inside my basement\nDrunk or sober, never lose your composure\nStress on the brain cause pain and stomach ulcers\nIf you can't understand, then come closer\nWe civilized the uncivilized like we supposed to\nDrunk or sober, never lose your composure\nMic in your hand, black man stand as a soldier\nStress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers\nIf you can't understand, then come closer", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0c9f932e47c1489614375ebfa506ce2f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
