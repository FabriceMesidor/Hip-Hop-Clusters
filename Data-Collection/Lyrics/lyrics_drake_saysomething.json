Want me to give it back?\n\nThis shit was all I knew\nYou and me only\nI did it all for you\nStill you were lonely\n\nWe coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change\nIt's funny how someone else's success brings pain\nWhen you no longer involved, that person has it all\nAnd you just stuck standing there\n\nBut, I'm gonna need you to say something baby\nSay something baby, say something baby, say something baby\nI'm gon' need you to say something baby\nI'm gon' need you to say something baby\n\nUh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration\nLet's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement\nTo a condo downtown cause it's all about location\nI sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life\n\nYou shoulda been here to kick it with me\nWe coulda split this whole thing up 50/50\nBut now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy\nKilling shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley\n\nHow I go from being the man that you argue with\nTo me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit\nI should wanna go back to the one I started with\nBut I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit\n\nYeah, just ask me how things are coming along\nYou can tell me that you never heard none of my songs\nLong as you end up saying one day you plan to listen\nCause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?\n\nThis shit was all I knew\nYou and me only\nI did it all for you\nStill you were lonely\n\nWe coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change\nIt's funny how someone else's success brings pain\nWhen you no longer involved, that person has it all\nAnd you just stuck standing there\n\nBut, I'm gonna need you to say something baby\nSay something baby, say something baby, say something baby\nI'm gon' need you to say something baby\nI'm gon' need you to say something baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc1b778ca59b60b3de0a2b3447378b61.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
