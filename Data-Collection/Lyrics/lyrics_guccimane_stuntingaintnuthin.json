the throat of the week\nGucci the GOAT, got my foot on a throat\nAnd my feet on the wood like I play in the league\nCriss-crossing the country like crossing the skreet\nAnd I feel like the Pope, all these crosses on me\nIf you still selling dope then I'm giving you hope\n'Cause ain't none of them getting more money than me\nI'ma keep giving them something to see\nHonestly, none of them fucking
