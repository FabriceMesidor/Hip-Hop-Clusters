Overnight?\nI'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite\nAnd when I pull up, vroom, motorbike\nNow all my niggas getting buck, overbite\nI see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's\nRaggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs\nI call the play, now do you see why?\nThese bitches calling me Manning Eli\nI hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling\nI got 'em scared, shook, panicking\nOverseas, church, Vatican\nYou at a standstill, mannequin\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nAll you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo\nBut I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets\nAnd I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend\nYeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if\nYou had the same passion that I have, yeah, right\nStill hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass\nAin't hot enough to set fire to dry grass\nAnd 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!\nGo take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony\n'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass\nYou know what time it is, so why ask?\nWhen Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)\n\n[Hook: Nicki Minaj]\nI feel pretty (x3)\nAnd witty\nAnd gay\nAnd I pity any girl who isn't me tonight\n\n[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]\nRaah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nRaah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon\nLike a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon\n\n[Outro: Nicki Minaj]\nRoman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!\nYou've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!\nYou and this boy Slim Shady!\nWhat's going on? They'll lock you away!\nThey'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!\nTake your mother's warning, Roman, please\nBack to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!\nWash your mouth out with soap, boys", "image": "https://images.genius.com/361fbb0a68e9287bdc9eb1ad1f8099a7.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
