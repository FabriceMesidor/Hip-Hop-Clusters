Barbeque\"\nNow you wanna hang with niggas I hung with\nFuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said\nIf I, ever make a record, I take a cheque\nAnd put something away for a rainy day to make my exit\nBut look at me now, ten years deep\nSince the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep\nI never asked to be top of rap's elite\nJust a ghetto child tryna learn the traps of the streets\nBut look at me now\n\n[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars\nAnd diamond rings can poison a rap star\nWas suicidal, high, smoking so much lye\nI saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky\nWish I could flap wings and fly away\nTo where black kings in Ghana stay\nSo I could get old, my flesh rot away\nBut that'll be the day when it's peace\nWhen my gat don't need to spray\nWhen these streets are safe to play\nSex with death, indulge in these women\nVision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire\nBroads play with pentagrams in they vagina\nLike the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds\nI beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?\nI'm your disciple, a thug certainly\nI'm the N, the A to the S-I-R\nIf I wasn't, I must've been Escobar\n.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection\nIn the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion\nWhen everything around me got cloudy\nThe chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me\nIt was clear why the struggle was so painful\nMetamorphosis, this is what I changed to\nAnd God, I'm so thankful\n\n[Chorus: Sugar Man sample]\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man\nYou're the man, you're the man", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b568e8d559c7ba98ef485809d81c1d79.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
