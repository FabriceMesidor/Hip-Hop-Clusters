Girl\nThese stab wounds multiply in your world\nYeah, they all plural\nI don't kill for the thrill, its for the nerds with the mills\nStill but no ladies to chill, its ill\nI don't find enjoyment, I find employment\nSlice a prostitute in the loins quick\nMoist grips, firmness, drooling from my lips\nSee the ripper can't be ripped, on his own shit\nSelf [??] yeah i ride my own dick\n\n[Chorus]\nSo in my mind we're fucking\nIn my mind we grinding\nIn my mind still unwinding\nI had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper\nIn my mind we grinding, grinding\nStill unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her\nSick like the ripper, the ripper", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1620b55458e423f96bf6316d13418223.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
