Blige & Pharrell Williams]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nPut down your bags, love\nI know in the past, love\nHas been sort of hard on you\nBut I see the God in you\nI just want to nurture it\nThough this love may hurt a bit\nWe dealing with this water, love\nYou even give my daughter love\nI want to build a tribe with you\nProtect and provide for you\nTruth is I can't hide from you\nThe pimp in me, may have to die with you\n\n[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Pharrell Williams]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n\n[Bridge: Mary J.
