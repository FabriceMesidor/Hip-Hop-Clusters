With trumped up charges against\nMy client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts\nOf flexing his G's, popping his P's\nDotting his I's and crossing his T's\nThe anti-player has filed and submitted an \"alpha\"-davit\nIn the Game Court. With trumped up charges against\nMy client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts\nOf verbal and reckless endangerment\nFrom the million dollar mouthpiece;\nAnd leaving these super-sap suckers\nDiscombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice\nThe anti-player, has filed and submitted an \"alpha\"-davit\nIn the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg\nTha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game\nCrossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system\nNow if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather\nBring him before 12 G's and open up his files\nAnd you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup\nHis tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll\nAnd charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension\nSo all you jerks with them $11 words\nComin out of your $2 mouth\nAbout a multi-million dollar Crip\nWho's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant\nAnd the tongue of a mack - I said\nHe's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars\nWhile you suckers is lookin for stripes\nHis game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;\nAnd with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court\nTo grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1abc5e5fc609da0014a0675d49a1a15f.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
