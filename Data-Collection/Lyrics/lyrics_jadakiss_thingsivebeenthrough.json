I just wanna thank y'all for takin' the time to listen\n(Ah-ha)\nI appreciate that\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, from regular TV to cable; from bouncin' label to label\nJust tryna get the horse out of the stable\nWas once part of a dynasty, at least I was tryna be\nThink it was the time in my life when I was findin' me\nSittin' in the spot with the dimes\nWillin' to do anything just to be a Bad Boy at the time (That's right)\nThen I rolled the dices, nah the money didn't add up\nBut just that whole experience, it was priceless\nNo free rides to the bank, on top of that\nWas the untimely demise of Frank (B.I.)\nThen the 'No Way Out' tour, we was smoking outdoor\nMade 80 stacks off Cee-lo, that's without tour\nVideotaped it all, I still watch it now\nTravel the world, learned how to rock a crowd\nIt ain't much but it beats poor\nThings that I've been through is all I can speak for\n\n[Hook: Luther Vandross samples from \"Promise Me\"]\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm on Ruff Ryders, Interscope, same shit\nPartnership, joint venture, fifty-fifty, same split\nJimmy put that money up, two singles off of *We Are the Streets*\nThen after that, seemed like he was done with us\nBut it wasn't over yet, Stout had a plan from the jump\nWhich was to come out with my solo next\nThings a little better, these the niggas that I've been doin' it with forever\nSo I'm like whatever\nFirst album dropped, promotion was hella\nEvery stage I rocked, the performance was stella\nHad the whole world ready to Ryde or Die for me\nAnd I wasn't even platinum, I was just side money\nX was bringin' in the moolah\nI was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler\nI can't tell you about the evil that men do\nI can only speak for the things that I've been through\n\n[Hook: Luther Vandross samples from \"Promise Me\"]\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through\n\n[Verse 3]\nAs far as The LOX, we all fine, cellar is all wine\nSelfish for me to say Roc-A-Fella is all mine\n'Cause it ain't, I'm just another employee that's on line\nTrying to get my act together and do it one more time\nTwenty-one gun salute with all 9's\nAnd I know it's on me to make sure that we all shine\nFall back, let the weed contact your mind\nCould find bullshit in any contract you sign\nBut if you from the streets though, there's plenty of loopholes to eat, yo\nOnce they let you in, you 'sposed to keep dough\nBut I can't give you the formula, I'm on it though\nExpect the worst, the outcome is enormous though\nStay humble, still keep your heat for insurance though\nThings that I been through to get it weren't norma,l yo\nYeah, this is what my heart beats for\nThings that I've been through is all I can speak for\n\n[Hook: Luther Vandross samples from \"Promise Me\"]\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through\nI can only speak for\nThe things that I've been through", "image": "https://images.genius.com/74f6cb8e37420dc73fd4019537e3cbd1.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
