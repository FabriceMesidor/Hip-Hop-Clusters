Oh, just throw away some pussy\nThen my conscious called me, 'Pussy'\nYou don't understand, mama had ass\nAnd I'm quite a butt man, I love my wife, but, man...\nI never thought of the day I would quit\nTill I opened the door, seen a nigga fuckin' my bitch\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]\nYou did me wrong, you put me down\nMade me feel low when you're around\nAnd you broke my heart, you broke my heart\nMy chips went down, it was you I needed\nBut I was not down, baby, barely breathin'\nAnd you broke my heart\nYou broke my heart", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/79340562821e3449a6df3155c59ee061.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
