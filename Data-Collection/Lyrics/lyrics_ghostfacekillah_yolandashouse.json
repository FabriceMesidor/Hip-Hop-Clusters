Don't go up in the spot\"\nJettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out\nDogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens\nI'm tryin' to think and toss the iron\nBomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin'\nMay God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath\nThe weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest\nTryin' to focus up and make progress\nThat's what I get for slingin' in them projects\nNext thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin'\nTold her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling\nCookin' me fries, fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits\nWhile she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick\nNow I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch\nI'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck\nLike come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box?\nShe finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops\nHandcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie\nJettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's\nSo I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door\nLike ooo I seen my man Meth goin' in raw\nSo he jumped up balls out, hid in the closet\nI'm dyin' laughin', he said \"Yo Starks be quiet!\"\n\n[Method Man]\n...and let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on?\nShoulda knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong\nBustin' in here on that government shit\nGot this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits\nShe's asthmatic and you laughin' son\nI bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin tryna grab the gun\n'Cause shit's real man, you spazzin' dun\nThere comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run\nYou know we family like Crack and Pun\nBut Mr. GFK, state your business after that, be one\nNow can it be that you hot, lord?\nYou did some shit on the block that the cops tryna lock you for?\nCan't believe you blowin' the spot, lord\nMy chick is buggin', she trippin'\nMy dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers\nNow I'm caught up in the drug sting\nNiggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on\nCan't understand it, it's a thug thing\nAnd in the middle of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon\n\n[Raekwon]\nI need my money Meth, gonna buy them hundred birds\nTell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work\nHe know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me\nWord to mother lord, son he got me hurt\nYou still fuckin' shorty? I knew it\nThe big mouth broad that be yolkin' my balls out\nHer little brother wanted two bricks\nYou know the nigga licks, a Maybach on twenty-six\nAll he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick\nHe told me foul shit, wild shit\nThat nigga wear a lot of loud shit, no that Steve Rifkind style shit\nHit me with some other talk, him in New York\nThey robbed the Venezuelan niggas, stabbed his son with a fork\nThat was Jesus' rooster's little niece, little nooses\nFather's homeboy, that's the kid who gave us a boost\nHe gave them things on the arm, said for us to be calm\nAnd if some beef pop off, go ahead and ring the alarm", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f1bbc70540da138c70debc041f381d0f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
