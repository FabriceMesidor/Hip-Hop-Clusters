Fucked around, threw truth in jail\nThe objective is to keep you blind\nSo along with the handcuffs on your arm they got shackles on your mind\nSeek and ye shall find (come on)\nAccepting failure is the only crime (what)\nFall down eight time and get up nine\n\n[Chorus]\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do\nWhen the shit don't go just like you want it to go\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do\nWhen it don't go through just like you want it to\n\n[Verse #2]\nPlenty a times a nigga slipped and fell\nGot right back up\nSlipped and fell\nGot up again\nSlipped and fell\nOne time I didn't get up as quick as I did before\nIt was hard as shit gettin' up off that floor (real talk)\nYou want the raw?\nAin't even about that\nIt's about when opportunity knocks\nHow you goin' be on the ground and expect to answer the door\nNo matter how hard a nigga goin' through it\nYou get up\nYou better stand up like shit\nI know I'm goin' do it\nDon't disrespect\nAny support from fake friends cause what you do with fake friends is figure if you done 'em wrong, make amends\nWalk your own\nDon't let 'em walk you\nAnd every once in awhile it's okay\n[?]\n\n[Chorus]\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do?\nWhen the shit don't go just like you want it to go\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do\nWhen it don't go through just like you want it to\n\n[Verse #3]\nEveryday we walk these dogs, we walk through the fog and\nOne day where you walk, we'll put you up in the morgue (check it)\nThe road was rough, but I'm built for it\nAnd when shit get tough that's real\n[?]\nMake every move the strongest one\nGet down to go hard\nCause the last [?]'ll be the longest one\nWe know the difference between right and wrong so don't mix it\nAnd if it ain't broke, don't fix it\nIf it ain't smoke, don't twist it\nI just hit y'all niggas with a jewel right there\nBut most of y'all missed it (Check it)\nYou fall out, get the fuck back up, try it again\n\n[Chorus]\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do\nWhen the shit don't go just like you want it to go\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do\nWhen it don't go through just like you want it to\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\n\n[Outro]\nYo, [?]\nAin't nothin' too big for the lord\nAll you gotta do is have faith\nFall down, get back up and try again\nThat's all you can do\nAccepting defeat is a sin\n\n[Post-outro Chorus]\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nWhat you goin' do when the shit don't go just like you want it to go\nGet up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)\nYou gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c768a0855d18bfa64f81a797bb10d78f.355x355x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
