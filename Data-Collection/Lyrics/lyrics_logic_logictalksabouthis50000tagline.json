But what I was saying in the original song, I was trying to talk about my experience at Lollapalooza. So when I was on my stage, a whole sea of people came through at Chicago and it was 50,000 people in the crowd, and I got a line that goes:\n\"Check the Instagram fam\nI got fifty-thousand people in the crowd, singin' out loud\nEvery word, that's every lyric\nYou can hate (shit), just stop actin' like you don't hear it\"And, for me, when I was in the booth, I trying to think of different cool ways to say \"fifty-thousand\", so I was like \"fifty-thousand people\" and I was like \"five-o-triple-o people done it\" and I was trying to flow, right? But I couldn't find it, so I just ended up going with \"I got fifty thousand people in the crowd\". But at the very end of the song, it said \"five-o-triple-o\" at the end and it sounded like a really cool tag, just like a dope kinda like production tag and so I left that on a couple of songs that I had, and it kinda made it on \"Flexicution\". I won't talk about that, so...hahaha.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
