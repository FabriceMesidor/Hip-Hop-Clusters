Real from Cypress Hill\nHow I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt\nI rhyme like life is still an uphill climb\nReady to face any challenge, waitin'\nCan taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation\nLook what I have built, reputation is validation\nThe only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing\nOnly thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement\nOr accusation... I am legendary status, in fact\nThat is the only way you'll ever be able to say\nYou're a legend is makin' an allegation\nI write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with\nAs I fight to the death, 'til my last breath\nManage to prove who the best man is\nPrevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'\nIn the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage\nOf knowin' what it's like to be southpaw\nCause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed\nCause I am\n\n[Hook]\nI am phenomenal\nWith every ounce of my blood\nWith every breath in my lungs\nWon't stop until I'm phe-no-menal\nI am phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I'll never say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible\u2019\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd1f0464141463bc29eaf6aa5d0c65d6.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
