Great\nIslam turn the bass kick up a bit\nHype the snare, now I got a place to sit\nAnd ride the track like a black mack in his 'lac\nHit the corner slow where the girls are at\nAnd kick game the way it should be done\nHow you gonna drop science? You're dumb\nStupid ignorant, don't even talk to me\nAt school you dropped Math, Science and History\nAnd then you get on the mic and try to act smart\nWell let me tell you one thing, you got heart\nTo perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait\nTill the press shove a mic in your face\nOr you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D\nStetsasonic or the Big Daddy\nAnd they ask you about the game you claim you got\nDrop science now, why not?\nYou start to sweat and fret, it gets hot\nHow'd you get into this spot?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou played yourself...\nYo, yo, you played yourself...\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L\nWhen it comes to dealin' with the females\nWhat you got they want, cash is what they need\nSlip sucker and they'll break you with speed\nBut you meet a freak, you try to turn her out\nSpendin' money's what I'm talkin' about\nBut you fool out, your pockets got blew out\nAnd after the date, no boots, you got threw out\nMad and shook 'cause your ducats got took\nCall her up, phone's off the hook\nBut who told you to front and flaunt your grip?\nYou can't buy no relationship\n\nYou played yourself...\nYo, homeboy, you played yourself...\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front\nAnd for the money they're sell out stunts\nBut they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash\nYo, let me straighten this out fast\nTwo hundred thousand records sold\nAnd these brothers start yellin' 'bout gold?\nYou better double that, then double that again\nAnd still don't get souped, my friend\nYou think you've made it, you're just a lucky man\nGuess who controls your destiny, fans\nBut you diss 'em 'cause you think you're a star\nThat attitude is rude, you won't get far\n'Cause they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick\nUnemployment's where you'll sit\nNo friends 'cause you dissed 'em too\nNo money, no crew, you're through\n\nYou played yourself...\nThat's right, you played yourself...\nYou played yourself...\nYo, yo, you played yourself...\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou got problems, you claim you need a break\nBut every dollar you get you take\nStraight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up\nYour idle time is spent trying to scheme up\nAnother way to get money for a jumbo\nWhen you go to sleep you count Five-O's\nLyin' and cheatin', everybody you're beatin'\nDirty clothes and you're skinny 'cause you haven't been eatin'\nYou ripped off all your family and your friends\nNowhere does your larceny end\nAnd then you get an idea for a big move\nAn armed robbery...smooth\nBut everything went wrong, somebody got shot\nYou couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped\nAnd now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row\nSociety's fault? No\nNobody put the crack into the pipe\nNobody made you smoke off your life\nYou thought that you could do dope and still stay cool? Fool\n\nYou played yourself...\nYou played yourself...\nAin't nobody else's fault, you played yourself", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76206f22d2fe6902a9b654c5a9cff401.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ice-T"}
