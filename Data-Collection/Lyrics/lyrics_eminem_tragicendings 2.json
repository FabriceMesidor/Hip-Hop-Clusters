Shoulda knew it!\nWho would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?\nAs soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid\nShe's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it\nLit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it\n\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey]\nIt's like I'm drowning at sea\nHoping that you reach for me\nI know you're there, but I can't see\n'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings\nI'm dying to breathe\nAnd all you do is strangle me\nSuch a beautiful relief\n'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings\n(Drunk off tragic endings)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/edd76153e7ac3ec36be997aea55f32ed.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
