This weekend I'm free\nTill then I'll just shine and let you find me\n\n[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]\nI shine like the sun\nMy mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun\nThis is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue\nMy mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country\nI run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line\nI run on these rappers so skip the stromboli\nI make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony\nSo how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?\nHow the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me\nWhen you all on the tip of my dick like Moby\nThe wait is over, no baking soda\nI saw them dudes move bricks and boulders\nI saw them dudes move flats and corners\nAnd they moved that sugar like Russell Stover\nI got that green like a four leaf clover\nGet rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters\nDope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty\nAnd if you dope boy, better watch the Wire\nAnd get the shit straight, turn back, retire\nCuz one in a mil turn snow to fire\nYou either move weight, play ball or neither\nBecause I'm neither, the hood Macgyver\nThe boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda\nMy life so sweet that my balls Godiva\nThe world in front and the hood behind us\nThe hood behind us\nYea\nThe hood behind us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78bea76bf210cec3130c214f2a4ab5f7.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
