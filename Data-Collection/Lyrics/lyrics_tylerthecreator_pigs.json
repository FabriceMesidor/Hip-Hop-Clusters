I hear helicopters make a dip\nI'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit\nYou better back up before this Mac start to lift up\nI'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up\nThe difference between us and our class is tan khakis\nI got 99 problems and all of them's being happy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde81a162bfe7b81092c8630cdf16d70.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
