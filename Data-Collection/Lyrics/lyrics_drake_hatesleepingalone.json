I get it poppin\u2019 don\u2019t I?\nI\u2019ll end up stopping won\u2019t I? And by the time I end up stopping\nYou\u2019ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don\u2019t lie\nShe\u2019s losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now\nBut instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now\nAnd she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now\nBut this money coming in is just confusing shit right now\nYou just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd rather be with you, but you are not around\nSo I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down\n'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone\nHalf the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\nYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\nBut I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone\nSo she\u2019s here and we're both so gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nHotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company\nFull name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me\nBut she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me\nIf she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me\nYou say that you over me you always end up under me\nYou know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me\nDon't start with yo' shit - I put you back in your place\nShe tells me \"I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face\"\nAnd hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you\nLike I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too\nAnd whoever I be with, they got nothing on you\nThat's just something to do when there's nothing to do\nYeah, but she's losing it right now\nShe has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now\nOne more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now\nYou just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd rather be with you, but you are not around\nSo I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down\n'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone\nHalf the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing\nYou leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months\nBut I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone\nSo she\u2019s here and we're both so gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a50b0608affc94c4dae3d502a65ea390.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
