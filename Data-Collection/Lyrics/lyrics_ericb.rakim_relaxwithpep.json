Well, is it?\nRelax, I'll track out, lap the half stepper\nHere come the right one baby I'm Dr. Pepper\nSo check the Richter, scale rhymes overload\nBlow up and explode, abrupt and reload the code\nYou can't pinpoint or locate, the rate\nOr evaluate the up to date, stayed\nUp front, laid back, coming off on track\nGirls want some of this because I'm all that\nSweat the concept as the ep's in depth\nAs the track is kept, you can't intercept the step\nReacts and projects and attracts and it gets\nTo the max and in depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c242f8367734db09ac26eb1c1bbcee98.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
