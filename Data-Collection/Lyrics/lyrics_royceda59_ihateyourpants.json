Are those designer jeans?\nCause I haven't seen 'em at Saks\nAnd I wish, that this all was a dream\nYou got a crotch like a Ken doll in them jeans\nAnd there's no way I should be able to see the imprint of your knees\nAnd them jeans, make you look like you got big feet\nAnd I wish that y'all would quit it with that dance\nAnd I hope y'all go to hell\n\n[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nYou are gay to me, and that's okay to me\nBut I still hate your pants\nYou're a fag to me, long as you're happy, be\nBut that don't mean I have to like your pants\n\n[Outro: Kid Vishis]\nSkinny jeans really, gross me out\nIt's just the whole concept, you know?\nPullin them over your hairy man ass\nAnd then, havin' to peel them off your hairy legs\nIt's disgusting,  Mickey Factz was\nIn the same room with Joey, when he got punched in the eye\nI blame it on the skinny jeans\nI blame it on the skinny jeans cause he couldn't react fast enough\nCause his legs was all caught up, in the skinny\nI hate skinny jeans", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f26afa0e15f73eb0b5cef561ec304c68.450x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
