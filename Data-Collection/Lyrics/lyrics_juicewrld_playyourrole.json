An L beat?\n\n[Chorus]\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking\n\n[Verse: 1]\nOh my god what is this? An L beat?\nKeep her checked like Nike, Shoes too pricey\nMove with the tool, so the dudes won't fight me\nIn the groove, with the crew, so the hoes still like me\nI'ma do what I do, cause my neck still icy\nWhoa, keep a choker with a .45, whoa\nRun up on me, you gon' die tonight, whoa\nSave the drama for another time, whoa\nWe'll leave a nigga traumatized\n\n[Chorus]\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking\n\n[Verse: 2]\nAnd I'm too damn cool\nIt ain't my fault, Raf Simons on my shoes\nI won't lose\nHoes gon' be hoes, bitches gon' do what they do (Oh my god what is this? An L beat?)\nI hate you, and you hate me so the feeling is mutual\nI got guns, and funds to do whatever the fuck I want to\nThese hoes tell lies, so she lyin' when she tellin' you that she bein' truthful\nGo sell my drugs, or count my money bitch, make yourself useful\nI think she had enough of that\nSo when she call me, I don't think I'm callin' back\nAll girls are the same, don't know how to act\nSo sell my drugs and make yourself useful\n\n[Chorus]\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking\nPlay your role, like an actor in a movie\nRoll up, let the Backwood soothe me\nLoaded up, if a fuck nigga try me\nShe say that I'm too damn high for her liking, aye", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
