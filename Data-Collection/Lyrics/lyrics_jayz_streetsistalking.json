Y'know, ehh\nLook..\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nIf I shoot you, I'm brainless\nDifferent toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin' this\nI'm waitin' on arraignment, my nigga is the plaintiff\nYeah, I know what you thinkin' - fucked up ain't it?\nI shoulda known better, and I planned to\nBut dog they be takin' me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle\nI sat back and watched it, put the Gats back in the closet\nThey tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage\nLet niggas take shots at me, no response\nI just flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz\nYou give a nigga a foot, he'll take you one step beyond\nHe'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm\nYou wanna conversate with the writer of the Qur'an\nOr Old Testament, don't test him then\nI know what y'all thinkin' dick, pause\nYour future's my past, I've been here before\nI know when you're schemin', I feel when you plottin'\nI got, mental vision, intuition\nI know where you goin' I read your mind's navigational system\nEverybody whisperin' - pst pst pst ss perspirin'\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know... geah geah\nYeah yeah yeah, yeah...\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nYou see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin'\nAnd I only use his waist to keep my Glock in\nBut when shit goes down you know who's doing the poppin'\nAnd if you don't know, guess who's doin' the droppin'\nS dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood\nBad move; that's bad news\nHow many times have I got to prove?\nHow many loved ones have you got to lose\nBefore you realize that it's probably true?\nWhatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do\nShit, I paid my dues, I made the news\nI came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews\nAnd the streets say Jigga can't go back home\nYou know when I heard that? When I was back home\nI'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome\nOn any Martin Luther, don't part with your future\nDon't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya\nThe answer is simply too dark for the user\nAnd as a snot-nose they said that he got flows\nBut will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?\n'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone\nFrom what the block has spoken, my God\nEverybody stressin', who's his baby's moms?\nWho he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh...\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know... chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah\nChicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah\nWhen the, streets is talkin', niggas is gossipin'\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh\nYeah, yo, yo\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nI seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know\nI lost my Pops when I was eleven, mmm, twelve years old\nHe's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin' it's toll\nBut I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad!\nI grew up pushin' snowflake to niggas that was pro-base\nThe stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face\nAll I did was smoke joke, think and drink\nCopped 'caine and complained, front row watch game\nI seen niggas before me, with a chance to write they own script\nSlip up and change the story\nI seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory\nBefore reachin' puberty, scared a nigga truthfully\nI took trips with so much shit in the whip\nThat if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF\nSmell me, nigga? The real me, nigga, minus the rumors\nHolla if you feel me, nigga\n\n[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]\nThe streets is not only watchin' but they talkin' now?\nShit, they got me circlin' the block before I'm parkin' now\nDon't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin', I'm just cautious now\nSub, under the parka, extra cartridge now\nHit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense\nI get word to the street like Bell Atlantic and Sprint\nI feel the vibes and I hear the rumors\nBut fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still in Jumu'ah I know 'stafALLAH\nNiggas wanna press me, put my back to the wall\nBut pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all\nTo know me's to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this\nFuck you, I got guns like Neo in Matrix\nCross the Family, think Mac's sweet like Karo\nOr soft like Play-Doh, get knocked off like Fredo Corleone\nThey find you with a hole in your dome\nI roll with niggas that'll follow you and go to your home\nThought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense\nCatch you while you reachin'\nClip you then I cross you then I'm leavin'\nApply full court pressure\nLike .44 Taurus get you out of here, pull pressure\nTo the trigger, bullets fly in three's\nYou forever rest under bullshit, dirt, lies and leaves\nI do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave\nLook in my eyes, realize it's Beans\nNiggas wanna despise the team; 'til I play head coach\nAnd straight up, divide they team\nTrade they man for some pies and a couple of things\n'Til the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c91a9bc0eb9aaf290224ebeaabd243a0.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
