And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nHot damn, black America again\nThink of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind\nThe color of my skin, they comparing it to sin\nThe darker it gets, the less fairer it has been\nThe hate the hate made, I inherited from them\nBut I ain't gon' point the finger\nWe got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie\nNeed to hear them songs sometimes to believe me\nWho freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?\nDrinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?\nEndangered in our own habitat\nThe guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back\nAs a matter of fact, we them lab rats\nYou build the projects for, now you want your hood back\nI guess if you could rap, you would express it too\nThat PTSD, we need professionals\nYou know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust\nFrom schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us\nTell your political parties invite us\nInstead of making voting laws to spite us\nYou know, you know we from a family of fighters\nFought in your wars and our wars\nYou put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two\nAnd then, maybe then we'll believe you\nSee black people in the future\nWe wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident\nAll men and women are created equal\nIncluding black Americans\n\n[Sample: James Brown]\nYou know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from\u2026\n\n[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story\nWe are rewriting the black American story", "image": "https://images.genius.com/565646b92582d86f0446dc67906334c7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
