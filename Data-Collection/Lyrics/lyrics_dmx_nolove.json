Is music... and I love music.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball\n\n[Verse 1]\nCats say they ridin', but half way through and they be like\n\"Not Gon be able to do it!\"\nJust last week wasn't really nothing to it\nCat's ain't shit, sad, I knew it\nYou know what it is, same old rappin\nLike watchin' a movie and knowin whats gonna happen\nCheck it, you do you I do me\nThe Dog gon' be alright you'll see\nBeen down this road before I'm sure\nThis is the battlefield and I'm built for war\nAin't nothin' new to a O.G\nBullshit, troubles, and hard times they all know me!\nThen there's the dick riders, the insiders\nBut the ones that we let get in right beside us\nKeep your friends close, enemies closer\nI got it, now I put 'em all in one pocket\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wish I could believe, I wanna count on you\nNever got to worry about me runnin' out on you\nAfter thinking about it I see what it was for\nIt took the snake to make me trust more\nI trust you to stab me in the back\nTrust you to stuck one in your mouth\nSoon as I walk out\nTrust you to steal from me, lie to me\nActing like we love each other why do we?\nEverything about you is crooked, look it\nFed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it\nThat's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid\nMost of you talk about \"try it\"\nFool me once, shame on you\nFool me twice, did what you supposed to do\nAin't never even thought about biting the hand that feeds me\nBut Y'all motherfuckers is greedy\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball\nIf I can't fuck with you for real, I can't fuck with you at all\nAnd that means y'all\nBut when you get caught up don't even call\nDon't worry 'bout me 'cause I'm gon' ball", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5e36caac869327ad8b5a01792f569aac.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
