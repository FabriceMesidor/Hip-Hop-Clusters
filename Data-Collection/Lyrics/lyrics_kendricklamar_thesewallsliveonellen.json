I\u2019m just a tenant\nLandlord said these walls vacant more than a minute\nThese walls are vulnerable, exclamation\nInterior pink, color coordinated\nI interrogated, every nook and cranny\nI mean it's still amazing before they couldn\u2019t stand me\nThese walls want to cry tears\nThese walls happier when I\u2019m here\nThese walls never could hold up\nEvery time I come around demolition might crush\n\n[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]\nIf these walls could talk (Step)\nI can feel your (Step) reign when it cries, (Uh) gold lives inside of (Step) you\nIf these walls could talk\nI love it when I\u2019m in it, (Uh) I love it when I\u2019m in it\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nThese walls could talk they\u2019d tell me to go deep\nYelling at me continuously, I can see\nYour defense mechanism is my decision\nKnock these walls down, that\u2019s my religion\nWalls feeling like they ready to close in\nI suffocate, then catch my second wind\nI resonate in these walls\nI don\u2019t know how long I can wait in these walls\nI\u2019ve been on the streets too long\nLooking at you from the outside in\nThey sing the same old song\nAbout how they walls always the cleanest\nI beg to differ, I rather miss them\nI rather call, I rather diss them\nI rather fall on you, put your wall up\nCause when I come around demolition go crush\n\n[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]\nIf these walls could talk (Uh)\nI can feel (Step) your reign when it cries (Chi-town step), gold lives inside of (Step) you\nIf these walls could talk (Step)\nI love it (? step) when I\u2019m in it, I love it when (? step) I\u2019m in it\n(Uh)\n\n[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd reality is\nSometimes through these ups and downs\nYou gotta know when to lead or to follow\nKeep steppin'\nChi-town\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nIf your walls could talk, they\u2019d tell you it\u2019s too late\nYour destiny accepted your fate\nBuild accessories and stash them on the are\nTake the recipe, the Bible and God\nWall telling you that commissary is low\nRace wars happening no calling CO\nNo calling your homie to save you\nHomies to say you're reputable, not acceptable\nYour behavior is Sammy Da Bull like\nA killer that turned snitch\nWalls is telling me you a\nYou pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them\n(That sentence so important)\nWalls telling you to listen to \"Sing About Me\"\nRetaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me\nKilled my homeboy and God spared your life\nDumb criminal got indicted same night\nSo when you play this song, rewind the first verse\nAbout me abusing my power so you can hurt\nAbout me and her in the shower whenever she horny\nAbout me and her in the after hour of the morning\nAbout her baby daddy that's currently serving life\nHow she think about you until we meet up at night\nAbout the only girl that cared about you when you asked her\nAnd how she messing with famous rapper\nWalls could talk\n\n[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]\n(Uh, hey)\nIf these walls could talk\n(Yeah)\n(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)\nIf these walls could talk (Yeah, hey)\n(I love it when I\u2019m in it, I love it when I\u2019m in it)\n(Yes)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebd2b3c0e4b4d737beaedc5e1bb0eee6.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
