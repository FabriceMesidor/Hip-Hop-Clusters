Cole]\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nBaby you deserve the whole enchilada\nGucci and Prada\nToast to the days when I didn't have a dollar\nYou stuck around even when the world frowned on me\nKicked me when I was down, and so they clowned on me\nDown for me, my homie\nYou better believe, I know your home girl said you should leave a note\nKnow you was tired like the Michelin man\nWhat if Gina would have listened to Pam?\nNow they hate to see us last this long\nWhen they get my album, probably pass this song\nThought they knew me well\nMoney can't buy you happiness that's true as hell\nBut happiness can't buy yo' ass this new SL\nI love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit\nI love you like the bad kid love breakin' shit\nRide or die chick, fighting insecurities\nWant a ring and my last name for securities\n\n[Hook: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and J. Cole]\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nI know my style ain't perfect\nI know my smile ain't perfect\nNigga ain't perfect, it's true\nFunny though I am perfect for you\nAll the drama seem worth it for you\nShe put up with the shit like she work at the zoo, true\nNow what you crying for?\nShe says you ain't gon' settle down, what you lyin' for?\nShe want that old thing back\nThings ain't the same, think we both seen that\nLove is war, end up on the floor\nBut baby you only lose when you don't swing back\nI say those words hoping that\nYou fight for a nigga like I fight for you\nLike I fight temptations every night for you\nAnd know I slip, only girl in my life is you\n\n[Hook: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko and J. Cole]\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly\nAnd we fly too, and we, and we\nAnd we fly too\n\n[Bridge: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nFeels as though our world's crashing down\nWe can\u2019t forget to breathe through this now\nWe live through the ups and the downs\nIt\u2019ll get better\n\n[Hook: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nIt may seem like our fire\nHas been a little burnt out, we're tired\nWe only need to stay close, in time\nSparks will fly", "image": "https://images.genius.com/963939859e3141f31cdf1b3d92cac677.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "J.
