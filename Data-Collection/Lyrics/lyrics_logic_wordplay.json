With everybody looking for a deal\nYou can call me Indy-ana Jones and I'm headed for the throne\nGoing on a M.J. beat, leave me alone, this is music\nWho are you to tell me how to use it?\nNever confuse it, originality, I'll never lose it\nMaybe I'm a little psycho, for hopping on the beat\nBut the logical part of me, telling me, you're feeling B\nSee? I'm a lyrical entity, blowing minds like Kennedy\nWith controversial lines, so everybody remember me\nI'm repping Maryland, if you bite\nI'll snap on you, like a Terrapin\nFlyer than an airplane, I'm just fucking around\nSwitch it up with various styles, just to keep you around\n\n[Outro: Michael Jackson]\nSome people are entertainers and some people are great entertainers, some people are followers and some people make the path and are pioneers", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f21a1e2589d732e4a263527296e9f51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
