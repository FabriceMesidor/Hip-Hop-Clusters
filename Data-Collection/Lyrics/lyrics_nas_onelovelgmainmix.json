I know shit is rough doing your bid\nWhen the cops came you should have slid to my crib\nFuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done\nPlus congratulations, you know you got a son\nI heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?\nTold her she should visit, that's when she got hyper\nFlipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough\nHe didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff\nI was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too\nFucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you\nBut yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?\nJerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach\nIt's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime\nHanging out with young thugs that all carry nines\nAnd night time is more trife than ever\nWhat up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?\nIf so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest\nSay what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet\nI left a half a hundred in your commissary\nYou was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? (One love)\n\n[Hook: Q-Tip] x5\nOne Love\n\n[Verse 2]\nDear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong\nOut in New York the same shit is going on\nThe crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking\nHold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking\nThat nigga you shot last year tried to appear\nLike he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting\nAnd he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock\nAnd now they run together, what up son, whatever\nSince I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease\nBut I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece\nWilding on the Island, but now in Elmira\nBetter chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire\nLast time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers\nBut maintain when you come home the corner's ours\nOn the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal\nWhen we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal\nBut chill, see you on the next V-I\nI gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks\nYour brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me\nHe might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low key\nSo stay civilized, time flies\nThough incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries\nIt kinda makes me want to murder, for reala\nI even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love\n\n[Hook: Q-Tip]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack\nMind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts\nWritten in school text books, bibles, et cetera\nFuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er\nSo I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad\nFor the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping\nA two day stay, you may say I need the time alone\nTo relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home\nYou see the streets had me stressed something terrible\nFucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue\nOr HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10\nA future in a maximum state pen is grim\nSo I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop\nRolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oo-wops\nHe said \"Nas, niggas caught me busting off the roof\nSo I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce\"\nHe inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep\nStarted coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak\nI sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black\nWe was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks\nI took the L when he passed it, this little bastard\nKeeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit\nI had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him\nCause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one\nTough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up\nCoulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up\nMistakes happen, so take heed never bust up\nAt the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed\nShorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul\nOnly twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style\nThen I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes\nThen froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose\nAnd told my little man I'm ghost, I broze\nLeft some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose\nWords of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above\nKeep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love\n\n[Hook: Q-Tip]\n\n[Outro:]\nOh, One Love, means keepin' it real\nFor the brothers that's locked down\nKeep that one love\nFor the brothers out in the East\nKeep that one love\nFor all the brothers uptown\nKeep that one love\nFor all the brothers in jail\nKeep that one love\nOne love means keepin' it real\nOne Love, One Love\nOne love means keepin' it real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ab51dbafd9e2abb1817cfbf10dd00a5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
