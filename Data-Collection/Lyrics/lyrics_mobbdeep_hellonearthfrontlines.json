set it off\nMy cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws\nWe takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors\nHere come the D's, time to make breeze and gun toss\nIn full force, my team'll go at your main source\nMy 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage\nYour whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit\nBlood flood your eye, fuck up your optics\nSwitch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit\nYo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?\nNine pound we rocked in '96, strike back with more hot shit\nIlluminate, my team'll glow like radiation\nWith no time for patient or complication\nLet's get it done right, my clique airtight\nTrapped in a never-ending gunfight\nSo niggas lose stripes or lose life\nJail niggas sendin' kites to the street\nOver some beef that wasn't fully cooked\nFinish 'em off, well-done meat\nThen send 22 slug to your head\nTravel all the way down to your leg\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo, it's Hell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nIt's right in front of your eyes\nAyo, it's Hell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nYo, it's right in front of your eyes\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nWe rep the QBC, nigga rep yours, it's all love\nMilli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug\nThen crack down on wannabe thugs\nAdapt to gat sound and bow down\nSlow the fuck up, see how my foul now\nArticulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit\nNever hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited\nSign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite\nThen reminisce 20 years later how we was gettin' it\nEither with me, go against the grain, you better hit me\nLeggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me\n\u2018Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches\nBitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures\n\u2018Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me\nAll that bullshit is just makin' me\nMore the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar\nIf shorty set you up you better dead her\nI told you, shape and mold you, son you then I hold you\nLike a pimp, mind-control you, double-edge blow you\nIt'll be I like I'm supposed to\nThe clique is coastal, international, you local\nBacardi mix physically fix\nHit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff\nProbably thick, son, I solved 'em\nPulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos\nWalk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop\nQB City Godfather Pt III\nGotti, Gambino and Ty Nitty, Scarface, rest in peace!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nAyo, it's right in front of your eyes\nHell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nAyo, it's right in front of your eyes\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nYo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips\nYou see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split\nLayin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids\nTurn off his lights, switch to darkness\nIt's deep in the abyss of street life\nBlood on my kicks, shit on my knife\nYou's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice\nI was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet\nThe Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded\nShut down your operation, closed for business\nLeave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness\nPOW niggas is found MIA\nWe move like special forces, Green Beret\nHeavily around my throat, I don't play\nShit brand new, back in '89 the same way\nThe God P walk with a limp see\nBut simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me\nTest me, you must be bent G, don't tempt me\nI had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty\nThe reason why it's full for so long \u2018cause I don't waste shit\nYou properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it\nQuiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin\nI hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb\nWhen they see us, I tell you what Black, here's the issue\nIt's a package deal: you rob me, you take these missiles\nAlong with that, I ain't your average cat\nFuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that\nWhatever it takes, however, it gots to go down\nFour mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound\nSpeakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground\nI could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless\nBlow-for-blow, let's find out who wear hardest\nThis rap artist used to be a stickup artist\nSometimes I test myself, see if I still got it\nA live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit\nOr forget the essence from which I emerged\nP is sick so save that bullshit for the birds\nLive up to my word, if I got beef niggas comin' in herds\nWe flush through, your clique get purged", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d1dd73f9d706c0ca5cd345184ebc1e56.500x500x1.jpg"}],
