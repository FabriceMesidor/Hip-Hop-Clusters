Are you ready for it?\nNever bored, I'ma get my phone, press record\nGirl, I'm grown so don't worry 'bout nobody knowin'\nIt was good, I just had to see what you was doin'\nIt's been a long time, but this thing ain't foreign\nGive it to you hard, we fuckin' up the headboard\nSwitching up positions in the bed, we ain't boring\nTakin' you up in the sky, feel like you soaring\nI was supposed to be writin' songs but I'm in my low-low\nWhen I'm\n\n[Chorus]\nRidin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you\nThinkin' 'bout what I might do\nDon't know what got into me\nProbably 'cause you keep sendin' me\nThem late night messages\nLate night messages\nLate night messages\nLate night messages\nKeep sendin' them late night messages\nLate night messages\nLate night messages\nLate night messages\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause when I say slide, you slide\nAnd when you say ride, I ride\nKeep a bad bitch by my side\nAnd when I say go, you go\nAnd when you say roll, I roll\nYou're the last one to hit my phone\nIn my car all alone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a52c028d5348dd3a779d4c0e8431c193.939x939x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
