What if you get your throat cut\nSold your soul for a dollar, now you having bad luck\nUsed to keep a bad bitch in the crib baggin' up\nPlayer here, player there, nigga turned you out\nBut never told you beware\nNever told you that black love supposed to be shared\nAnd you never judge a woman by the texture of her hair\nFancy cars and gold teeth, G-strings and things\nThe almighty dollar replace the wedding ring\nThe Ark of the Covenant was held by a king\nI ain't trading my soul in for skins and chrome rims\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?\nI can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?\nI can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind\nI can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line\nI can't think, mo' murder every day around the way\nI can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay\nI can't think, it's all about survival God\nYou know the epilogue by James Todd\n\n[Verse 3]\nThink about it yo, think about it\nThink about it yo, think about it\nThink about it yo, think about it\nThink about it yo, think about it!\nThe dawn, of a new millennium, came to pass\nThe world revolves around sex or cash\nThe black man's motto, \"Kiss my ass!\"\nShorties in kindergarten are strapped, ready to blast\nAll I ever seen was killers and dope fiends\nFrom FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens\nBronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between\nNo matter what, you always got a Judas on your team\nGiving it to the world and I'm telling it like it is\nTossing lyrical daggers and sending 'em in your wig\nKnow where the body's buried, I ain't saying where it is\nRaised inside the ghetto, but dammit I wanna live\nThe legendary master of lyrical combat\nBut ain't no competition, ain't nobody to go at\nSo I'ma take the time and spit a universal verse\nHit the streets with a blessing and erase the curse\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't think, why do I feel I'm losing my mind?\nI can't think, could it be the ill beats and rhymes?\nI can't think, even though I'm a one of a kind\nI can't think, I want the paper, that's just the bottom line\nI can't think, mo' murder every day around the way\nI can't think, I'd rather get paid and parlay\nI can't think, it's all about survival God\nYou know the epilogue by James Todd", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d9009021acaa20a396f75cbd74c2360.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
