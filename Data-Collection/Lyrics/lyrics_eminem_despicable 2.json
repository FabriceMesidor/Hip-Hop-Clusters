And you want a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, you twats?\nFuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl\nGet rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall, like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all\nAin't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap, yeah, but I'm home\nBad to the bone, back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on\nIt'll never be my chair that you own\nCrown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen, other words, there's no heir to the throne\nWhen I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit, bitch ask Doc\nGot it ziplocked in a bag, you fags ain't been able to fade me\nSince Kid Rock had a high top, keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle\nAnd I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog, get off my bone\nThis is my mic, doggonit; I like hoggin' it\nFlow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it\nI'm soggin' it, pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it\nSuplexing it on cement\nLike I'm on some \"Straight Outta Compton\" shit\nTake this dick and chomp on it, I'm so bad I can bitch-slap a back-handed compliment\nJackass, eat a donkey dick, the game I just about conquered it\nLike Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit\nI reign supreme in this honkey shit, no sense screaming and arguing\nMakes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in\nYou think you ball? Well, I palm it, I throw up bombs when I vomit\nBoy, I throw down in the kitchen, might hit your mom with my omelette\nBut you got egg on your face, now watch me drop an atomic\nI should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze, bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy\nIt's obvious, you can tell right off the bat\nNo pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head\nTryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web\nI'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage\nI'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food\nI give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude\nGuess I just do what you can't do and make you look stupid and bamboozled\nConfused as usual and you can get whipped, she can open a can too\nBut you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck outta Hell's Kitchen\nI came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken\nYeah, it's Shady, slut, the rest can suck on a big one\n'Cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5b1972630fd7ae6595a8788791ff967d.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
