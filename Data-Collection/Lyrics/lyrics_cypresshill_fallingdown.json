I take what I want, naturally\nYou're the casualty as we casually take you tragically\nMagically make you disappear, randomly cause calamity\n\n[Chorus]\nSittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up\nSittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up\nI keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down\nI keep fallin' down (Stay down)\nI keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down\nI keep fallin' down (Stay down)\n\n[Verse 2: Sen Dog]\nThis is the insanity, get this dose of anarchy\nSoak in all of the vanity, devoid of all humanity, examine me\nBreak apart your family, randomly\n'Cause what ahead of me? This is a rhapsody, a tragedy\nExamine me, take a close look like a man, throwin' the ghost hook\nGot you fuckin' shook, and now I close the book\nAs I'm walkin' through the park, got you scared of the dark\nFrightened by the shadows, I'm the one that is behind\n\n[Chorus]\nSittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up\nSittin' in the Cali sun, heat it up\nI keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down\nI keep fallin' down (Stay down)\nI keep fallin' down, I keep fallin' down\nI keep fallin' down (Stay down)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1db636d2c3463e2af11b01112ad70920.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
