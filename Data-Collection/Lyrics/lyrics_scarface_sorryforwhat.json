This ain't what I used to be\nTomorrow, I'll be somebody else, 'cause I ain't been me\nI can't seem to shake these, I'll put that there on every day\nBoy tryna figure me out, is like Lamar changing\nBut my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms\nShe told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job\nSeventh grade; failing, and I don't know my next of kin\nThese days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?\nMy daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen 'em\nSo, ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here befo'\nIt's sad but I ain't feelin nuttin, my whole life's been a fuckin maze\nAnd when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away\nLost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now\nQuick to tell me \"Show you some love\" nigga show you Hell\nAin't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile\nMomma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?\nSaid it, outside, I knew you seen it in my face\nI wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way\nCopped me a Cheverolet, drift away to the other side just to think\nIf I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride\nAnd thank you for my other kids and even though\nThey mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad\nLow on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be\nThe bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me\n'Cause I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up\nBut you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up\nIt's bad enough, face to face, always wanna catch a case\nSo bad, they'll try an get me they make me - and what takes the cake\nIs the whole world is fuckin up, daddy know where the weankess at\nAnd you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?\nJepordize everything, just for searchin for larger life\nSacrificin the whole family, with no regards to Christ\nFunny how people can take this shit for granted, right?\nBut then reality strikes, and changes things overnight\nI thank the Lord for watchin over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong\nI repent religiously, hopin that the weak get strong\nWhen the heat get's on [wind blowing]\nHopin that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on\n\n[talking - echo after each pause]\nYa know, the street's different, stays as it likes\nEither, headin into a storm, ya in a storm\nOr ya just got out of a storm, (yeah) think about it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2361572b4ea20d3eff0b970b4f5f5a1e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
