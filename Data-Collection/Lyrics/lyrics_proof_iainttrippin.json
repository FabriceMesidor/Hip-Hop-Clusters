I ain't trippin' man\nYou been real distant, but I ain't trippin man\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy situation ain't improvin', in fact, I'm still [?]\nPaid my dues and still losing, walk in my shoes then\nFirst son passed, the second one is here now\nConfused, reaching for the weed and all the beer now\nNever rep for self, try to live for all\nBut you didn't appreciate the real time I given y'all\nIs it y'all that you don't want it and flaunt it in rhymes?\nYou are my path for this cash seen hundred at time\nIt's crazy with the bullshit, y'all addressing me\nWhen every real man makes out his own destiny\nYou know that saying I depressed you, neglect you and left you\nSharp minds, no harp wires, that respect's due\nI had to get my thought on, through the drama brought on\nI feel y'all 'cause I slept on Em when he got on\nWhen pressure's above, there's no justice for scrubs\nY'all was thicker than water but not less than blood\nI can't believe y'all deceived me behind my back\nFlipping for fame, damn where you mommy at?\nPut the time with Zac still gon' hug y'all\nNo matter you think my niggas I love y'all\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for sayin' that, I ain't trippin' man\nI love you though Proof, I ain't trippin' man\nWe still gon' be dawgs though right, I ain't trippin' man\nYou been real distant, I ain't trippin man\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's easy to express all my pain with ink\nWho held you down with love, if you brain would think\nThe fame will wink and the game extinct\nIt's plain and bleak that I came in peace (Peace)\nBut the love heal, my love kill\nThis love give, shit or this love still\nIs your love fake, or is your love real?\nAnyway fakin' luck and he be gettin' the bill\nWhen you lose trust you lose light true\nThrough my consciousness is that of a confused Christ\nI choose right and obey your decision\nBut you need to be men and just play your position\nMy flesh is sacred committed by God\nIf I'm livin' large, shit's likewise for the whole squad\nMy body is a temple, it simple to read it\nIf the Lord don't give it, then I must not need it\nThe world is cold, don't be afraid nigga\nDon't let the fame fuck your brain, I ain't payin' nigga\nStill got a thug for scrilla\nNo matter what you do and say your thing, shit I love y'all niggas, c'mon\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for sayin' that there, I ain't trippin' man\nI love you though Proof, I ain't trippin' man\nWe still dawgs though right, I ain't trippin' man\nYou been real real distant, but I ain't trippin man\nI didn't mean to really say that, I ain't trippin' man\nCan we shake on that? I ain't trippin' man\nSomebody robbed [?] records, I ain't trippin man\nSorry for sayin' that, but I ain't trippin' man", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a9a6c306e6ebd80f4136c1c7407750f9.587x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Proof"}
