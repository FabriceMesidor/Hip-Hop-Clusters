yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nAmerikkkan Idol, one hand on my bible, one hand on my rifle\nI'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival\nThey say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals\nSo I came to kill the game and still gave it revival\nI'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel\nLast nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial\nI'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel\nNow she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial\nWhile I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now\nI wanna be down but she denounced\nI got my shot, then made her, bounce\nNow you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now\nWhile the future figure me out\nTold mommy pick a place, yo, and we out\n'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now\nThat's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around\nNever thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down\nProtect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town\nAnd they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown\nAnd for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground\nAnd have the nerve to blame it all on my background\nSorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out\nGot a message for the world and I won't back out\nSo turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out\nWatch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House\nBut I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black\nAnd we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack\nMedia's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact\nFeedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs\nAssimilate our history then made it a mystery\nNow they all inherit the bittersweet victory\nLook at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?\nJustice never served, reparations never sent to me\nIt's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me\nAssassinate my character, buryin' my entity\nBut they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done\nThey forever gon' remember me\nThe fuck is you tellin' me?\nFuck is you tellin' me?\nWay more than a celebrity\nAnd fuck white supremacy, huh\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nDead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nBecause I've never known a live one that represent me\nWell, dead presidents to represent me\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nDead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nBecause I've never known a live one that represent me\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's no contest, can't fuck with the congress\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nIt's no contest, can't fuck with the congress\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis that Bada$$-assination\nTopic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation\nBeen makin' observations like it's my occupation\nDebatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature\nThou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you\n'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up\nClimb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though\nDevisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke\n\n[Bridge]\nYou leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise\nGot to fill this void, I got to be the voice\nYeah yeah yeah\nI said leave me no choice, about to bring noise\nGot to fill this void, I got to be the voice\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil\nDisturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain\nWith all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander\nStart a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike\nThey are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it\nThey want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails\nAlton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world\nThe scary part, boys and girls\nIs most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness\nIt is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement\nAnd accomplishment of what we call human rights\nIt is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell\nI just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it\nBecause this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'\nThey're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off\nUsin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion\nThe cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough\nThere are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want\nWe have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane\nBut to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same\nAs black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us\nThe people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally\nIt's time to even the score\n'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?\nWe are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another\nBut not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other\nThe code words to killin' a black man by police is, \"He's got a gun\"\nDamned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs\nOr what about them? Them murderers got it\nWe need solutions, you better start plottin' now\nIt's always been clear that they don't value our lives\nMy people been sufferin' way too long\nAnd I'm tired of singin' the same old song\nPeople actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong\nJustice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that\nWhat are we to do? We're scattered around\nWith no clue of this ugly truth\nAll we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed\nTime to wake the fuck up and do our own research\nAnd not form opinions based on just what we've heard\nAmeri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon\nAnd eventually, we'll all be doomed\nReal, real, real soon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84b143545e0338f7b7459bb9ab8ecca4.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joey Bada$$"}
