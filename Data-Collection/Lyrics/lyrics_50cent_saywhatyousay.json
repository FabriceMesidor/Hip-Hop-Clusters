You gotta be strapped to get rid of me\nI'll leave you in water like the Statue of Liberty\nI'm tryin to be cool\nBlowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school\nKeep rappin' for your hood, I'm rappin' for Benzes\nAnd long assault rifles with straps on the lenses\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nYall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)\nWhat I learned from Gotta Rock and Spank G (Un-Huh)\nYall niggas gotta learn from me (Yeah!!)\nWhat I learned from watching Brucie B\nLook, I shot the sheriff\nAnd nigga if you get too close yo punk ass getting shot\nHere's the plan, I'm a keep stackin' my ends\nTill I'm on airplane seats in the Maybach benz\nI'm all about the chips\nI done took them trips\n22's on the 6\n26 on the bricks\nAnd them outta town niggas, I'm chargin' yall more\nI tapdance on the shit I ain't servin' it raw\nYou sell smoke, look, nigga, I got what you need\nBut it ain't goin' cheap I got mouths to feed\nNiggas always sayin' damn 50 you bugged\nCause I got hoes giving niggas the date rape drug\nGimme his watch and his chain\nWe not the same, he a lame\nHe want pussy I'm bout my money man\nCrap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick\nThrew a 7 so many times they thought the dice was fixed\nYo it's 50, when your mindframe change and start to rearrange\nI'll see you another day motherfucker it's 50\nShots 'til your heart drop and freeze up, ease up motherfucker\n\n[Hook: 50 Cent]\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out\nYou can say what you want about me\nAs long as you don't get in the way of my money\nCause all that talking shit to me played out\nNigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd2b4854454a895a49da3fbb67e2d805.953x946x1.jpg"}], "artist": "50 Cent"}
