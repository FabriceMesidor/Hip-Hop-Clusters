No\nMy chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smoking that Cali\nCaught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window\nKinda' see my father's features creeping in a little\nGot an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica\nTell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll take her\nAnd I'm late to a date with my wife, I realize\nI stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise\nAnd I'm walking through it, chaos is all around me\nBut God got me, no fear, through the fire, try and stop me\n\n[Chorus 2: Keon Bryce]\nThere's a war in the streets tonight\nAnd all this drama's got me feeling uptight\nI don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo\nCause she's standing on the corner of Linden Boulevard\nHolding our baby in her baby in her arms\nSo hold on, your daddy's in sight\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nYeah, nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes\nFor the first time, praise God, baby mom's crying\nPlanned to be a strong black family\nBut we both were too young, too strung, too much flashing\nNewcomer called Verbal Assassin running with\nNothing but the worst type, worst fight\nWhen we brought my baby home the first night\nCursed like sailors, burst out the crib raging\nIn my new car bought from entertainment\nChampagne and gaining clout fast, whiplash\nDid this bitch just pass in the club hugged up, stupid ass\nGrabbed her by the pony tail, \"never disrespect me\"\nI'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi\nMoved back to your grandma, I'm single, the Land's mine\nShe keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again\nSqueezing the pen, released again, chart toppers\nHard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems\nNew woman, she's great, this a different world\nChecking out my wife's chemistry with my little girl\nIt's so amazing, playing, life is so crazy\nI've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me\n\n[Chorus 1: Keon Bryce]\nThere's a war in the streets tonight\nAnd nobody's really feeling alright\nI got a blunt for my chronic, a juice for my tonic\nI know now that I'm feeling right if it goes down\n'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown\nAnd I know it's not my time to go now\n'Cause God's got my back in this showdown\nSo I know we'll be alright\n\n[Music changes]\n\n[Outro: Unknown speaker]\nFrom the day you was born...\nYour daughter Destiny, was one of your destinations...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/65c98702fc773f6dafd41563fe5c5485.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
