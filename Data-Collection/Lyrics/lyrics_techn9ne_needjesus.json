(oh, Jesus! Jesus!)\nEvery day they wanna condemn me\nNone of 'em even know me\nAnyone live without sin cast that stone at the Stone\nLet's talk about it\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nI'm askin'\nWhat's happening?\nBoy, 'cause they bashing me\nBangin' the bible, butcher boy, don't bother with blasphemy\nCall 'em a crazy critic comin' causin' catastrophes\nAimin' at Aaron a lot of ammo and an angel actually\nOh mane, Amen\nYou people let the steeples speak in evil and the neezle playing God hymn\nMy mother was a Christian but I used to go with the Wiccan for the stickin', what\u2019s the problem?\nQuestioning the K.O.D.'s grim, anybody talkin' hella crazy I'm 'bout to jaw them\nYou'll be up on a cross whenever you step to me so take precaution\nY'all false actors, callin' me a demon when I talk backwards tihs pot\nTecca Nina gon' be sought after, this drop by the people that go toss rappers hip hop\nSo you thinking you religious?\nWhen you condemn another man, you never lead us\nTelling me what's under me is gonna heat us\nNever believe ya 'cause really you need Jesus\nLeave us\n\n[Bridge: Stevie Stone]\nTalk about me, judge me\nSpeakin' I'm evil to people, I'm leadin' 'em underway\nHow you read me and see me, easy to be shunned away\nBut you got it all wrong\nLet's talk about it\n\n[Verse 3: JL of B. Hood]\nMama never really talked about God\nAll that I was ever taught was I'm odd\nHeard he knew 'bout every thought that I had\nDirty mind I'd see a cross and I'd hide\nLost without dad, salty 'bout that\nBut I was captivated by the bosses outside\nI plotted every way to get in drawers with my squad (church)\nAsk round why every man goes\nBad habits to pass down like second hand clothes, mad\nSalvage a blouse, gown, and manicured toes\nHad half of us ground bound for hell and lord knows\nNeed a savior they say slayed for your behavior\nRaised in three days, grace be what he gave ya\nThe Son of the maker, one to gravitate to\nPay ten percent 'cause sins ya didn\u2019t pay for\nBow to a name insane fast, he told the\nVows to a dame, the tame Casanova\nWow did it change and came crashing, poser\nDoused in the flames and bang chapter closure\nSpiritually drained, crass and vulgar\nNeeded somewhere to go until rain passes over\nSeeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah\nBut I don't know if the ordained pastor sober\nDang in disdain prayed in vain\nCare slain yo, explain do anything\nLay hands, but role playing, you entertain\nDoubt, pain, processin' grow in the brain\nIt's confusing, now my fangs out protruding\nRebuking from mouths full of communion\nScorn by lukewarm kind, it's time you've been warned\nThe Storm formed, now find refuge in...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dac1cf83fc6c83ed086fa8adde3a8bc2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
