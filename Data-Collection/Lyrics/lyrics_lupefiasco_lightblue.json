I blew all that for this great flow\nWish a nigga would step on this Pergo that I paid for\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nRed lights, obey my headlights\nThat head red like peg, or Santa's sled lights\nThat mean I heard what she said 'fo she said what she said outta head\nIt's like I got a head mic'd\nLike a Fed might, but I ain't fed like\nBeen a hands on homie, my head right\nDreadlocks, but no Red Stripe and that both ours like red bike\nAnd the Feds know what I roll like\nIn a dead man, with some low-lifes\nMe stopped, then your lights\nI got no lights 'til the stop-sign\nI got no rights like Nascar\nOr a black man in the deep south\nDuring Jim Crow with the police\nThat's 99 problems with a ho twice\nFrom no life to Frankenstein, got it stitched up I'm so nice\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9eccaadde5460ff7db59d4b7dddd43b5.497x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
