Well I need you right here\nYou need to slow it down, cause the streets don\u2019t fight fair\nFor real!\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\n\n[Verse 2: Jake Lambo]\nIt\u2019s easy to get in trouble in the place where I\u2019m from\nNiggas lacking the education but be packing a gun\nI just kick it with the homies and be having some fun\nMama keep calling, I understand you protecting your son\nYou found that I be smoking and I know it makes you mad\nAnd I know you see his trace, scared I'ma be just like my dad\nScared I\u2019m doing something bad, scared I might end up dead\nWell look I chose another path so get those worries out your head\nI'ma keep on doing it how I\u2019m doing it\nStay working hard, making this music and\nShow you I got to get it, I do\nThey asking my motivation and I reply that it\u2019s you mama\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\n\n[Verse 3: B.o.B.]\nA deadly trend that never ends\nCity full of negligence, pregnant pedestrians\nI used to think, 'am I a prisoner or a resident?'\nThey book us for possession but they keep shipping weapons in\nEither the Glock shoots you or a cop do you\nThey set the system up to lock you up a lot sooner\nEverything you try to do they try to out do you\nMy mama said hallelujah cause I got a future\nI got a future after something newer\nThey try to sell you bullshit because it sounds cooler\nAnd if you stand out from the crowd they label you a loser\nDon\u2019t throw your life away, don\u2019t let your eyes fool you\nThat\u2019s how they use you\n\n[Hook: Victoria Monet]\nBaby, don\u2019t you know\nEverything you do away from home\nCould leave me here alone\nSo baby don\u2019t you go, no\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo\nNo, no\nNo-o-o-oo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07af9b12b2956baf31b88d2ae47697d2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
