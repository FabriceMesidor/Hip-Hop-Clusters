As if I went somewhere!\n\n[Verse]\nHave you bumped your head? Is you out your mind?\nThinking I'm gon' play dead, and I won't shine\nHomie I don't lose, even when I ain't tryin'\nStart spreading the news, shawty, cause I ain't dying\nDon't be frontin' for nothin', cousin, 'cause I ain't lyin'\nI'm too far in the front, and you steady falling behind\nJust a friendly reminder to you, in case you forgot\nI'm at the top of the pile, whether you like it or not\nWhether you like it or not\nYou looking at a head case with a fed case\nGot rid of all the AKs, they were dead weight\n\n[Echo to fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f08c14dfef32114f3f4458805c96968.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
