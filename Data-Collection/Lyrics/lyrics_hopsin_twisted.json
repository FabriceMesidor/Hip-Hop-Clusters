Fuck being positive!\nI'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus\nShit's about to go down, I can promise it, biatch!\n\n[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u2014\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow you tryna drive from the backseat?\nI been runnin' things like an athlete\nPedal to the metal goin' max speed\nSippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep\nLaboratory smellin' like a gas leak\nGoin' up in flames when the track beat\nI made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week\nNiggas feelin' me like Mr. King's last speech\nWhen you mix in a lot of hardcore revenge\nA pitchfork and sins, then misfortune wins\nYou can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch\nAnd pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz\nSo many fake friends, I'm bored of friends\nLife feel just like I'm bordered in\nHave I talked to the Lord? I sorta been\nI been battlin' with life in a tournament\nLet me spit the facts\nBitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch\nFirst empire I built, shit collapsed\nHad bad splits 'til my lips were chapped\nBack in high school where not many kids could rap\nBut I engineered they ass just for cash\nNiggas couldn't see where my head was at\nIn my living room where I rest the plaques\nSo here's my conclusion\nAs I sit in this booth I condition to bruise\nI'm vicious and gruesome, you're listenin' to\nSome premeditated murder, yes, I meant to intrude\nIt's Panorama city, madness up against me\nYou see Prodigy the rapper TAC committee\nI been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin', like\u2014\n\n[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u2014\n\n[Bridge]\nWelcome to my euphoria\nThis is a place where I'm too victorious\nThis ain't a place where the grass is greener\nThis is a place full of mad demeanor\nLook sideways, catch a bag of fever\nNiggas stay shooked like they havin' seizures\nMy life's a movie, this track\u2019s a teaser\nSo recognize the real nigga\n\n[Hook]\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nBig shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up\nYou better not get it twisted, nigga\nFor real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)\nRespect my name when it leave your mouth\nYou better not get it\u2014", "image": "https://images.genius.com/538c208e6d573914c37ce0417736d005.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
