Don\u2019t let nobody but you\n\nYou know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I\u2019m uncontrollable or something. Like I don\u2019t do what I\u2019m supposed to do. You know it\u2019s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It\u2019s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are\n\nCuz as far as I\u2019m concerned everybody\u2019s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I\u2019m concerned everybody\u2019s a star\n\nYou know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don\u2019t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies\n\nYou know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let\u2019s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin\u2019 out of control tonight. We goin\u2019 out of control tonight. Ahh\n\nHow many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\n\nNow with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn\u2019t fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\n\nSee this is what I\u2019m talking about.This is what I\u2019m talking about. This is what I\u2019m talking about. I mean, this is what I\u2019m talking about, this is what I\u2019m talking about\n\nHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they\u2019ll say, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I\u2019m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they\u2019re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a word or not, but it\u2019s now a word, cuz I said it\u2019s a fucking word \u2014 and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y\u2019all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager \u2026 how many people want to contribute something to the world?\n\nYou see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I\u2019m not \u2014 [to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light \u2014 I\u2019m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I\u2019m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, [crowd chants \u201cKanye\u201d] people they talk to you like you\u2019re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I\u2019m not gonna call no names out, I\u2019m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I\u2019m not going to say no names or anything\n\nBut if you\u2019re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I\u2019ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I\u2019m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I\u2019m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t discriminate against me, because I\u2019m a black man or because I\u2019m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren\u2019t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?\n\nAnd they say, \u201cNo, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That\u2019s too much. That\u2019s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That\u2019s way too much. That\u2019s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain\u2019t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let\u2019s set \u2018em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It\u2019s about my dreams. It\u2019s about everybody\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s about creating. It\u2019s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it\u2019s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will\n\nAnd I\u2019m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you\u2019re gonna try. You\u2019re gonna try to break them down. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I\u2019m gonna marry you! And I\u2019m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I\u2019m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don\u2019t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn\u2019t my fault. They try to control y\u2019all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with celebrities.\u201d That\u2019s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it\u2019s fucking terrorist\n\nYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do\n\nLet\u2019s have a toast for the douchebags\n\nSource: Vulture", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9fa6626ebb7cecda3ba692c1c80f52bf.1000x664x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
