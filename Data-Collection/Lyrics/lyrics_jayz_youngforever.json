Forever young\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nFear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive\nLife is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky\nFear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's\nAre not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive\nThrough the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots\nMy name shall be passed down to generations\nWhile debating up in barbershops\nYoung slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here\nWith a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)\nAnd as the father pass the story down to his son's ears\nYoung'll get younger every year, yeah\nSo if you love me baby, this is how you let me know\nDon't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]\nForever young, I wanna be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?\nForever young, I wanna be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nJust let it run..\nSlamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches\nPopping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)\nNiggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit\nI be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)\nI'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit\nAnd I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit\nLess than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in\nDid you get the picture yet?\nI'm painting you a portrait of Young\n\n[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]\nForever young, I wanna be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever?
