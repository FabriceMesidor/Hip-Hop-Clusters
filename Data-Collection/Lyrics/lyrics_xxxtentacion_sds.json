So angry I can't think\nI always got thoughts to be fucking losing, What would a nigga do\nIf he was In my situation. I already know that'll he be cutting\nI'm tired of having hoes to be buttfucking and having them cumming\nI'm never done, All my life I've been hustling\nSoon I'll be drug chugging. Just because I be giving bitches hugs\nMeans I'm touching well In love I'll be on my way trespassing\nTook that beer drove a car to a gas station man was In for a crashing\nI'm a wild nigga, I always be cussing not knowing my bitch be\nDick sucking, Drop the knife and watch your arm be blood gushing\nThe endless pain has no numbing I don't know what to do\nI can't proper my steps I'm falling I can't properly function\nWhy hasen't someone done something?!\n\n[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]\nSDS,SDS,SDS\nSomebody do something\n\n[Verse 2: Nyora Spouse]\nI'm fucking dizzy none notices shit I need somebody\nSomebody to make me get off these drugs and cuff me\nYou lucky I ain't naughty, I be shooting them down make em'\nSay ouch gun finna' go pow expect a crowd to go wow\nWho gives a fuck about being ugly She'll still suck me\nNigga I'm fucking gnarly mostly I be going fucking crazy\nMy rhythm Is godly most importantly It's mighty make one\nTo fight me I always be spittin' bars calmly\nSay shit with memory If I flame a Nigga I don't count as guilty\n\n[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]\nSDS,SDS,SDS\nSomebody do something\nSDS,SDS,SDS\nSomebody do something\n\n[Outro: XXXTENTACION & Nyora Spouse]\nSomething...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed3e6fcf8b03cdc942ab3685954d6f65.621x622x1.jpg"}], "artist": "XXXTENTACION"}
