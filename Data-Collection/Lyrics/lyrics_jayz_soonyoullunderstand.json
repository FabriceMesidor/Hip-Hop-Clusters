I, call myself easing the load\nI made the load heavy, I need money for commissary\nTry to understand, please\n\n[Chorus]\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll understand", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c91a9bc0eb9aaf290224ebeaabd243a0.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
