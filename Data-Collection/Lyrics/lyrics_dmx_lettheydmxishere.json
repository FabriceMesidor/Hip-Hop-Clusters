In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated\nSome animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen\nInstead of hemoglobin\nInsects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood\nThe difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Two: DMX]\nIn most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying\nMolecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies\nAre small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system\nBased largely on white blood cells\nWhite blood cells help to resist infections and parasites\nPlatelets are important in the clotting of blood\nArthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three: DMX]\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels\nBy the pumping action of the heart\nIn animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen\nFrom inhaled air to the tissues of the body\nAnd venous blood carries carbon dioxide\nA waste product of metabolism produced by cells\nFrom the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato-\n(also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (haima)\nFor \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology\nBlood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue\nGiven its origin in the bones\nAnd the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Four: Swizz Beatz]\nDue to its importance to life\nBlood is associated with a large number of beliefs\nOne of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol\nFor family relationships through birth/parentage\nTo be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance\nRather than marriage\nThis bears closely to bloodlines\nAnd sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\"\nAnd \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\"\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions\nBecause Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\"\nThis phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood\nOr eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off\nMythic references to blood can sometimes\nBe connected to the life-giving nature of blood\nSeen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death\nIhave often noticed that\nAncestors never boast\nThe descendants who boast\nOf ancestors\nI would rather start a family than one blood will tell but often it tells too much\nDance mehitabel dance\nCaper and shake a leg\nWhat little blood is left\nWill fizz like wine in a keg\nBlood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells (in animals) \u2013 such as nutrients and oxygen\nAnd transports waste products away from those same cells\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1bcf43b1cc0f34db6cd70e1a63c8b84c.464x464x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
