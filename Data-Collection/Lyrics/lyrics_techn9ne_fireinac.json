I put my fangs on\nThen it's game on, for the pain, gonna break his dang bones\nCause James wrong, get him a hook to hang on\nAnd drain Holmes veins; get em to switch his insane tone\nYou have entered the dungeon of real killers\nDemons they will fill us, with drillas and steel millas\nHe'll pay me with his life, cause this animal's real crazy\nCause this motherfucker don't even care if he kill babies\nI wish, this would've happen like it happened in my mind\nInstead of what occurred in theater number 9\nMy condolences to the families that mourn\nAll humanity was torn, for what he damaged see some horns, motherfucker\nBurn in hell for eternity for what you did\nThe depths of Hell gonna swallow your ass!\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Smackola]\nGone, baby, gone, never made the dawn\nNever had a fucking chance to turn crazy on\nMy fire in AC he stopped you, shocked you\nAurora Colorado, I got you\n\n[Verse 2: Smackola]\nRaa!
