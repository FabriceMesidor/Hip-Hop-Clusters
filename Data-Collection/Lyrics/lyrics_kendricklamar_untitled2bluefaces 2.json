Went to work for it\nSee, a nine-to-five was so jive turkey\nBut when Thanksgiving came, checks didn\u2019t hurt me\nYou plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment\nWe both criminals with bad intentions\nThey say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my success\nCorvettes by tomorrow, ugh!\n\n[Hook]\nWhy so sad? Walking around with them blue faces\nShe said I\u2019m down on my luck\nAnd it\u2019s something I gotta have, blue faces\nI hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue faces\nGet that new money, and it\u2019s breaking me down\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy homegirl got a credit card scam\nShe got a scholarship to college but she don\u2019t give a damn\nIntuition got a Black woman wishin'\nShe saying this on the phone with the noodles in the pan\nI know you, woman, I console you, woman\nYou feel like the universe owes you, woman\nOh, the anticipation, hoping you could make it\nWomen don't prosper chasin' education\nBut you're talented, and can't handle it\nAnd your homegirls can't be your manager\n365 times four, plus more\nCan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?\nBut ain't no money like fast money\nEven today, I'm considered a crash dummy\nA rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?\nMy accolades better than all them\n\n[Hook]\nBut why I'm so sad?\nWalking around with them blue faces\nShe said I\u2019m down on my luck\nAnd it\u2019s something I gotta have, blue faces (Faces)\nI hit the bank today and tell 'em, color me bad, blue faces\nGet that new money, and it\u2019s breaking me down, to the top\n\n[Bridge]\nI love God, I love speed\nI love drank, I love mead\nI love oceans in the deep\nI love women, I love me\nI love God\nUgh!
