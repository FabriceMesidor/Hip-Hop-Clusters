I'll make you sing like Big Ruben\nMan, in the hood, I'm the American Idol\nFirst I fight you, and then run up on your stairs with a rifle\nBang! Tech claims make you wipe out like X-Games\nNext sprain's in your motherfuckin' leg band\nTryin' to shoot me like they tryin' to shoot 50\nEither you gon' die or need a new kidney\n'Till I drop, I'ma sell to your friends\n'Till I get some of that tin, in the federal pin\nI spit better than them\nNiggas wanna fight me, better go get in the gym\nOr the metal'll spin\nSince smoke's in 'Nam, doin' more drugs than Eminem moms\nTen times, Dirty Dozen, all ex-cons\nBash your ride, crash when you drive\nFlip your dumbass out the passenger side\nUhn!
