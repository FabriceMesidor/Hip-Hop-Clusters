I just want to keep y'all all posted, keep in mind, that we don't have too much time to take time for granted. We need all to make the moves necessary to get it all, before they try to cut us off. Motherfuckers got to really realize that if we don't bring it now, we might never again find the precious opportunity like now to ever bring it again. So all my motherfuckers stay tuned\n\n\"Damn if I just had a little bit more time, if I only knew what I know now, things would be better. Would it? Is it too late? Damn is it too late?\"\n\n(Outro Instrumental)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8769bd52f12b0c4930edbc0a93c9cca.1000x973x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
