(Tell me why)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause we don't own anything\nWe don't stand for anything\nAnd so we fall for anything\nWe wasn't born with anything\nWe don't control anything\nAnd we don't own anything\nAnd we don't learn anything\nSo we don't earn anything\nWe sell our soul for anything\nWe sell our soul for everything\n\n[Verse 2]\nMom and papa used to fall out over everything\nI'm at the mall, I'm spendin' all I got on everything\nMoney and the power, bitches over everything\nIt don't make sense if I ain't livin' for everything\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cept we don't live for anything\nNiggas kill for anything\nWe dyin' over everything\nWe killin' over anything\nKillin' over anything\n\n[Outro]\n\"America will always side with those whom she can direct\nGive orders to, and have those orders obeyed.\" - Minister Louis Farrakhan\n\"There is no police brutality.\" - Sheriff David A. Clark\n\"God bless America.\" - Don King, nigga\n(Paper tears)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ece0d83dced13a6ca8fbcbc25cfd032f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
