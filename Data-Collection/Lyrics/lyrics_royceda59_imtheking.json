You a nigga that I don't like as a person\n\n[Chorus]\nI'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more\nBurn 'til I can't burn no more\nShine 'til there's no shine no more\n'til the Earth can't turn no more\nUntil I'm 5'9\" no more, I'm the king\n\nI'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more\nBurn 'til I can't burn no more\nShine 'til there's no shine no more\n'til the Earth can't turn no more\nUntil I'm 5'9\" no more, I'm the king\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in shape to give you a quick whoopin', hard asshole in the wall\nFrownin' up, niggas thinkin' you sick cause you sick lookin', I'm heated\nAnd I'mma go to trial blowin' my triggers\nY'all niggas ain't rough, you need to smile more in ya pictures\nSplit somebody, and serve the nigga whose style you bit\nThat bit like ten niggas that bit somebody\nTop of the world, all that's around you is beneath me\nMe learnin' from your mistakes is the only way you can teach me\nMore thunder, cockin' big heat\nSo undergrounds niggas wit' beef can get more under, 6 feet\nMan ya missles, I plan to diss you\nUnleash wit' about 30 punches before the first lands and hits you\nNiggas I doubt y'all cause I'm an outlaw\nRight-handed, built with a left that can out arm wrestle a southpaw\nGun shine bright, y'all niggas? Y'all need to rhyme like 5'9\"\nUnsigned with hype, King\n\n[Chorus]\nI'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more\nBurn 'til I can't burn no more\nShine 'til there's no shine no more\n'til the Earth can't turn no more\nUntil I'm 5'9\" no more, I'm the king\n\nI'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more\nBurn 'til I can't burn no more\nShine 'til there's no shine no more\n'til the Earth can't turn no more\nUntil I'm 5'9\" no more, I'm the king\n\n[Outro]\nI'm the king (On the microphone)\nI'm the king (No, no I ain't jokin')\nI'm the king (That's in command, that's in command)\nI'm the king (On the microphone)\nI'm the king (The funk rhymin' master)\nI'm the king (That's in command, that's in command)\nI'm the king", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ea6b18623746fe7fa4ec54a079b99a0b.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
