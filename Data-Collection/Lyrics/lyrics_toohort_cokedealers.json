I come from the Oakland town\nTask force roll and rock, cold cracked down\nYoung brothers my age making dollars so long\nDrive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone\nSee him draped in gold, we call him Big Bank Bob\nGot a ring for each finger and he can't get a job\nCall him trash, he supplies for the dopefiend's tweak\nBut what you make in a year he might make in a week\nCold cash money is the answer to life\nFeedin fat hovers to a dopefiend's pipe\nGotta keep rollin, just can't stop\nOnly two worries are a thief or the cops\nPeople keep sayin: it's all so wrong\nBut the rocks roll strong all night long\nAnother part of street life, the age old story\nAnd now the coke dealers take all the glory\nThey're the ones you meet big time on the street\nI say the coke dealers are now the elite\nSee, the average dopehouse will take your soul\nTrade it for a rock and do the same with your gold\nBut if you think about it really it all sounds silly\nSmoked out Willie in his washed-up Philly\nOpen up shop down the block\nAnd everybody's tryin to get a piece of that rock\n\nCoke dealers\nBig time, baby\nSmokin\nCoke\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nCocaine the demon, it knows you well\nSellin you a trip to a place called hell\nYou never even thought you'd get hooked\nStarin in the mirror, scared to look\nYou think about life and think it's cold\nLike drivin with a flat down a rocky road\nNow the rock man is your best friend\nThe only one you talk to time and again\nYou even tried dealin, but that's no fun\nBefore you made a sale it was in your lungs\nSo the coke dealer now lives on your life\nLike a four year marriage you're the man's wife\nYou can hate it with a passion, but you won't fuss\nHe's the driver of a Caddy and you're ridin the bus\nYou think it's not fair, I tell you it is\nCause he bought yours and you bought his\nBought his cars, his clothes, and he bought the coke\nNow he looks good and you look smoked\nIt doesn't take much to realize\nAll you gotta do is just open your eyes\nYou're cold bein pimped by a rock in some glass\nWhat's it gonna take before you fall on your ass?\nBankrupt, smoked out, just simply through\nCold street walkin with a hole in your shoe\n\nCoke dealers\nBig time, baby\nSmokin\nCokeland\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nI once had a homeboy rollin strong\nSold coke all day and all night long\nHe made a lotta money and bought a lotta stuff\nBut soon he went broke and it didn't take much\nFirst he started smokin, and all that he figured\nWas the more he sold dope, you see his bank got bigger\nBut my homie thought wrong cause he could be stopped\nThe vice squad rolled and the boy got popped\nHe was out on bail before he made it to jail\nWasn't about to do time when he's doin so well\nSay he had a lotta money and some real good friends\nBut he was almost broke when he flipped again\nSo he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day\nOpened up shop and started pumpin the weight\nHe thought about the boys that he could not pay\nSo he hustled by himself thinkin that's okay\nBut one night he was chillin with a freak named Carol\nHis door was kicked in and he was starin at a barrel\nThe brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base\nWalked right up and put the Uzi in his face\nHe said, \"Give up the dope if you still wanna breathe\nI tell you one time, you better listen to me\"\nAs my homie got robbed he lost the fight\nAnd now he's just a smoker probably toking tonight\n\nCoke dealers\nYeah, I'm big time, baby\nSmokin\nCOKE!\n\nCoke dealers\nBig time, baby\n\nCoke dealers\nBig time, baby\nSmokin\nThe City of Dope\nCokeland\nSmokin\nIt don't stop", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c043954948d32c484654ee77fde522ed.320x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
