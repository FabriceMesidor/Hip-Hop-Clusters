Is it weaker without a name?\nDoes this love deserve 2 exist without a title\nbecause I dare not share its name\nDoes that make me cruel and cold\n2 deny the world of my salvation\nbecause I chose 2 let it grow\nPeople tend 2 choke\nthat which they do not understand\nWhy shouldn't I be weary\nand withhold this love from MAN\nWhat of a love unspoken\nno one ever knows\nBut this is a love that lasts\nand in secrecy it grows", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06dee150ef8c1c103f898ce76c8a66b5.401x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
