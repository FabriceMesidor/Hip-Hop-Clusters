Kelly]\nStreet dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)\nAin't nothin' out there for ya\n(There ain't nothin' out there for you)\nSituations gettin' heavy\nHeavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nBlack clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs\nLate night under the Moon as they assume I'm slangin' drugs\n'Cause I'm hooded up, thought a G a night wasn't good enough\nPushed my luck, yo, they had a brother put in cuffs\nLuckily, made it out of court comfortably\nJudge said I need a job, ain't nothin' comin' free\nCould've got a one to three\nI try to school these shorties under me\nBut they can't see, from life to death\nSo now we back to where we never left\nThe ghetto \u2013 it's a damn shame, knowin' it's a man's game\nShorty thinks it's time to make your plans change\nAll that runnin' round tryin' to chase what's already here\nBeen there, it's goin' nowhere\nPops told me knuckle up, no fear\nI wish some of these killings they could be prevented\nWhatever happens, it was written, meaning God meant it\nBut during life, you put your heart in it\nEven though it seems we bein' targeted\nLet that brother R hit it\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nStreet dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)\nAin't nothin' out there for ya\n(There ain't nothin' out there for you)\nSituations gettin' heavy\nHeavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta\n\n[Bridge: R. Kelly]\nDream on, dream on\nDream on, dream on\nDream on, dream on\nDream on, dream on\nStreet dreamer, yeah\nStreet dreamer, dream on\nDream on\n\n[Verse 3: Nas (R. Kelly)]\nSort of wild; since a child, hope was all we had\nDreamt of plushed-out pads\nComplainin', the mental strainin'\nHow many in my crew was into gainin'?\nSubtract the weak links up out the chain and\nRise and start reignin'\nBlasphemy usin' Nas' name in vain\nSome claim supreme being yet they lied in his name\nI tried to learn the game and only thing I found incredible\nEverything I tried to learn, see, I already knew (that's right)\nAnd it's embedded in my heart now\nSo I could sit back, count a stack, and play my part now\nI saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise\nPut a gun to me, hungry, he went on to chastise\n\"That's Nas, ain't it? Made it rich from entertainment\"\nFresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with\nMy first thought was: \"How the game flip?\"\nYo, perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on 'gac\nOr was I marked for a contract for some foul act\nI did a while back or even beyond that\nHe got me layin' face flat, sayin' my grace, Black\nWoke up in a cold sweat, yo, I hate that\nNightmares feelin' real, word to Will\nMy A-Alike I lost in the battlefield\nThat's why I hit the mic with mad appeal\nGrab your shield and meet your maker\nThe Queens niggas die for paper\nDeed the things, the street dreams will take ya\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nStreet dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)\nAin't nothin' out there for ya\n(There ain't nothin' out there for you)\nSituations gettin' heavy\nHeavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta\nStreet dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)\nAin't nothin' out there for ya\n(There ain't nothin' out there for you)\nSituations gettin' heavy\nHeavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta\nStreet dreamer (Oh mercy mercy me)\nAin't nothin' out there for ya\n(There ain't nothin' out there for you)\nSituations gettin' heavy\nHeavy, heavy, tryin' to be a gangsta", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3377a66ad11ed1a90b49424f00fb81c1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
