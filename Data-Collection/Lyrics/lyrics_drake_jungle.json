Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nIf I need to talk, are you around?\nAre you down for the cause?\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\nYou still down? You still down? You still down?\n\n[Chorus: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano]\nRock me real slowly\nPut a bib on me\nI'm just like a baby, droolin' over you\nThe things you do\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous\nThey go to school and do bottle service\nThey can't decide, they keep switchin' majors\nBeing indecisive makes me anxious\nCall your number and it's out of service\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nWho can I call for your information?\nWhat am I supposed to do\nAfter we done everything that we've done?\nWho is your replacement?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\n\n[Chorus: Gabriel Garz\u00f3n Montano]\nRock me real slowly\nPut a bib on me\nI'm just like a baby, droolin' over you\nThe things you do", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86c0604ab3c6bdf136408f04dea78810.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
