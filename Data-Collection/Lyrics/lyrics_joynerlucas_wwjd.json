(alright hold up.)\n\nShovels to my gravestone, kicking dirt on my coffin\nBroke bitches with their hand out, cause they heard I was balling\nFuck me so good, went to sleep, woke in the morning\nSix niggas in my face, Guns drawn with no warning\nPistol whip, stomped me and left me like I was dead\nI had murder on my conscience, I was plotting on revenge\nCircling the block like I know what I need to do\nBefore I cock the fucking hammer I said what would Jesus do...\n\n[Interlude]\nBecause Christ is not only leader\nHe was teacher\nBut not just leader and teacher\nHe was Christ the redeemer\nChrist the restorer\nChrist the deliverer\n\n[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]\nHate's the only motivation, that's how real we made it\nGuilty by association, you affiliated\nSmoking Newports while I'm riding the Willie Mays\nWatch you niggas turn bitch, there's nothing more humiliating\nI wonder what my life be like, if I ain't had no hobby\nProbably dancing with the Devil, moving like a Jabbawockeez\nI just want change, wonder how much that'll cost me\nI don't think I have a heartbeat I'm just.. (alright fuck it)\n\nTempest keep raging my mind, don't ever sleep\nSee my cousin in the cold, gave him a ride up the street\nBlue flashing lights, pulled behind me it's the police\nSo my cousin reached in his jeans, threw the burner under my seat\nThey pulled us out the car, got charged with a loaded 9\nCause he told the boys it was mine, I was facing a 5-9\nMy Mama sold the car, bailed out in a week or two\nBefore I caught that nigga slipping, I said what would Jesus do...\n\n[Interlude 2]\nNot that Jesus is God\nBecause Jesus never told you to worship Him\nHe told you to follow Him\nAnd you see, Pastor, when we praise Jesus\nHe's worthy to be praised, we feel good don't we\nBut not enough, follow Him\n\n[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]\nRappers on TV with jewels,  we idolize them\nPicturing myself on the news and paparazzi\nBunch of grimy thoughts, niggas never had no conscience\nI've been looking for a jux, being broke is not an option\nI've never been violent, I'm shaking just being honest\nEspecially when my girl ain't working and we was starving\nArgue every minute, fighting in a small apartment\nShe tripping just non-stop and I'm like.. (shh bitch I got to go)\n\nLooking for some pussy to fuck just for one night\nGet some anger out my chest and bust until I'm right\nMet this shorty at the bar, she was working for some tips\nTook me back to her crib and I was nervous as a bitch\nHer husband came home and he was lurking in the crib\nWhile I was jerking in his bitch, he grabbed the burner out the 6\nBursting in the room, cocked it back, from me to you wait\nBefore you pull that trigger think of what would Jesus...\n\n(Gun shots and screams)\nYou're going to feel, the presence, of God\n(Gun shots and screams)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0f1ef72a727167faed7990bf3663ea4.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Joyner Lucas"}
