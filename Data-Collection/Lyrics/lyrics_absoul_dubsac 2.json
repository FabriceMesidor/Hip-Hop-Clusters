You niggas are silly out here tryin' to look cute and shit man. Quit playing. This is serious bruh, niggas wanna come talk to me about all this dumb shit; a nigga ain't tryna hear that man. I'ma come clean bruh, go sit down with all that my nigga. This shit's over here from the grass... (?) We gon' handle it, how handle it my nigga straight like that, bruh. Eh, niggas out here look silly, my nigga. Like bruh, if you don't know me, look at my fucking Twitter, my nigga. It's your boy A-Mack out here man, Zanzilla, slapping niggas and bitches for fun, straight like that\n\n[Verse 4: Punch]\nNiggas chased my uncle there\nThrough God's grace, the gun jammed\nI found comfort in this pleasure\nMeaning I slept the best through gun sounds\nThese Days it's a little different\nBetween me and my past, I put a little distance\nEgyptian cotton, thread count vicious\nStarted as a dream, manifest into little Kendrick\nNow everybody feel it\nEven niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it!\nSelective amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days\nNiggas ask about pressure\nI grew up watching freebase literally eat the face of my hood\nSo basically I beat the case, I vanished but left a trace\nJust in case a nigga gotta go back\nYeah, it's not for games if I say that\n\n[Chorus: Ab-Soul & SZA]\nI just might be in yo' hood\nI just might be in yo' hood\nI just might be in yo' hood\nI just might be in yo' hood", "image": "https://images.genius.com/077bbd628ad3b7383f095afde8670b76.560x560x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
