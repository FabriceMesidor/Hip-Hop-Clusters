We're living to die\nCompare me to a disease, who's sicker than I?\nI can tell if he new to the league or if he a star\nI developed the unit in G's like 50 and Sha\n\n[Hook]\nM.I.C\nWe run Detroit\nRoyce 5'9\"\nI run Detroit\n\n[Outro: Statik Selektah]\nBig shoutout to the whole Showoff crew", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f966eb73a81b58069fb8aff648de307.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
