Just keep the casket closed\nNo remorse when a life is lost\nI paid my dues, paid the cost\nAnd my pockets are still fat\nWherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat\nEven if my crew asleep and I'm one deep\nI attract attention, people like to peep\nSo come say hi to the bad guy\nDon't say goodbye, I don't plan to die\n'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice\nIn control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini\nHang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me\nI'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat\nBut no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot\nWhen I cook beef, the smoke will never clear\nAreas in fear 'cause this here's severe\nLivin' life too close to the edge\nHopin' that I Know the Ledge\n\n[Verse 4]\nA brand new morn', no time to yawn\nShower's on, power's on\nLate for school, I catch the train\nGirls sip the style and whisper my name\nI push up like an exercise\nCheck they intellect and inspect the thighs\nSelect the best one, pull her to the side\nKeep her occupied for the rest of the ride\nRead her my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she know already, cool\nJust meet me after school\nWe can moan and groan until your moms come home\nAnd you'll be calling me Al \"Dope\" Capone\nSweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose\nCome get me, that's if you want to sip the juice\n'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety\n'Cause a lot of niggas hate me\nComin' out of the building, they set me up\nSprayed with automatics, they wet me up\nIn a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge\nI guess I didn't Know the Ledge", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0bdfe8ab59109beaad61ac05bf2a2b5.822x822x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric B. & Rakim"}
