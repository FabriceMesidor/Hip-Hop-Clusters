Cole]\nYou can drop a \u201cWet Floor\u201d sign down for the tears\nGod and my court date, the two things I fear\nMan, they tryna give a nigga years\nI\u2019m tryna figure if I should even appear\nOr should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound\nChange my name, right \u2013 catch a plane flight\nOut the country, let them ma\u2019fuckas hunt me\nCome and catch me if you want me\nKnow they\u2019ll lock me if I stay\nBut where I\u2019mma run to?\nI got a good girl, we got a son too\nAnd all we went through, we ain\u2019t see eye-to-eye\nBut what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die\nSo if they give me one, or if they give me two\nOr if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few\nBefore I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?\nWould you find someone new or would you stay?\nLike the hoes when they lay with me?\nPuppy eyes when I go, sayin\u2019 \u201cstay with me\u201d\nAw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I\u2019d love to\nBut see I got a girl I\u2019m really makin\u2019 love to\nTherefore I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a lot more guilty when I rub you\nThat\u2019s why I skip all of that kissin\u2019 when I fuck you\nFlush the condom down the toilet then I skate\nI had you, but you can\u2019t have me, I never stay\n\n[Hook]\nStay\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nHa! Life in a hometown, \u2018fore I could take a step\nI\u2019m gettin\u2019 grown now\nAnd startin\u2019 to notice that I see the same hoes around\nGuess they had to go \u2018round, my raps is profound\nI got the flows, but yet a nigga ain\u2019t got no sound\nCopped a beat machine, I\u2019m cookin\u2019 up my own now\nGot my mind on the city where it goes down\nSee, if I\u2019mma get to where I\u2019m goin\u2019 then I can\u2019t stay\nAlthough I love it here\nI\u2019ll be damned if I sit around another year\nDreamin\u2019 dreams, hopin\u2019 somehow that they just appear\nThe hardest part of leavin\u2019 is to know my mother here\nOh, but I\u2019m comin\u2019 back \u2013 oh boy, believe that\nLet\u2019s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that\nGot the city on my shoulders, piggy back\nHello, my name is Cole and I\u2019m here to stay", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23061dd2dc7e863127db561906debd27.434x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
