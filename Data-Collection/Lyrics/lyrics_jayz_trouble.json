(*laughs*) y'all know what I mean\n\n[Chorus]\nI try to pretend that I'm different but in the end\nWe're all the same, all the same\nI pray to God, Father forgive a nigga\nI'm never gonna change, gonna change\nI try to pretend that I'm different but in the end\nWe're all the same, all the same\nI pray to God, Father forgive a nigga\nI'm never gonna change, gonna change\n\n[Verse 3]\nUnh, you lil' niggas ain't deep you dumb\nYou niggas ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggas\nHock-too, spew lil' niggas\nI can only view lil' niggas like lil' niggas\nBut in lieu of lil' niggas tryna play that boy\nI *phew, phew* lil' niggas with the latest toy\nUnlike you, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-ass man\nBig shoes to fill, nigga, grown-ass pants\nProbably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents\nIt's apparent you're staring at a legend who\nPut a few lil' niggas in their place before\nTryna eat without saying their grace before\nBlasphemous bastard, get your faith restored\nYou're viewing your version of the Lord\nGod MC, lil' nigga, applaud, or\nForever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all\nI rebuke you, lil' nigga, the meek shall perish\nI'll roof you, lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist\nCute, you lil' niggas think you in my class\nSubstitute, lil' niggas soon feel my wrath\nI mute you, lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga\nI child abuse you, lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga\nNow shoot, you lil' niggas, go somewhere and play\n'Cause the day I lose to you lil' niggas, no day\n\n[Chorus]\nI try to pretend that I'm different but in the end\nWe're all the same, all the same\nI pray to God, Father forgive a nigga\nI'm never gonna change, gonna change\nI try to pretend that I'm different but in the end\nWe're all the same, all the same\nI pray to God, Father forgive a nigga\nI'm never gonna change, gonna change", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4371d45b1c52d7dc87e4204ae0aa8373.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
