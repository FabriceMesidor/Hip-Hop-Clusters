My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n\n[Verse 1]\nI got people scared as fuck like when condoms break\nOr how your heart deals with eatin' eighty pounds of steak\nSo put your belly on a plate and watch your weight\nYou frosted like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!\nWho want come face me, face come want who?\nAnd women give me face till they're face turns blue\nThey can't breathe, dick to mouth recessatation\nA tight squeeze which stops the length to conversations\nI play stations, duck cops and lose agents\nI'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients\nWhen I kick and rip and flip an indespensable rhyme\nMy black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime\nAnd it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke\nNeighbors called the fire station off the blunt that I smoke\nYou see I crush cowards, funerals I'll send flowers\nAnd I'm on the overpass flick pennies at rush hour\n\n[Hook]\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou see I'm ambidextrous I slap ass with both hands\nDelete your first steps, but I'll save the last dance\nI just bought some new guns my mama said \"it ain't worth it\"\nBut I'm at the shooting range just cause practice makes perfect\nBullseye, I stunt growth and stop lives\nYou run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies\nBok bok bok I'm shakin' your tail feathers\nI got big balls, I'm a Sac King like Chris Webber\nLuda' will take you back to Duck Hunt and Double Dribble\nWhen niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels\nMy cars got big TVs and satellites\nI got a Wheel of Fortune cause I flipped O's like Vanna White\nAnd the survey says? (Kill a mutha fucka now)\nCould it be off with his head? (Or shoot a mutha fucka down)\nGround round, ground chuck your ground beef\nBullets gather round then I shoot rounds around teeth\n\n[Hook]\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n\n[Verse 3]\nI kick niggas in they're ass reboot 'em like laptops\nAnd they wouldn't even box if I gave 'em a flat top\nYou punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble\nNow they all lost for words like I beat 'em in Scrabble\nYou see I'm from a small town called \"Fresh out a cop's ass\"\nWhere Mr. Head-Potatoes are skinned they get mashed\nI smell puss from fifty yards\nY'all not playin with full decks as if I jacked out ya Jacks and left fifty cards\nCatch me in Vegas spinnin' the green\nI re-up with more chips than a vending machine\nThen you can catch me in Rome, mackin' some broads and stickin' 'em\nAnd you'll be at home picking your boogers and flicking 'em\nA drug dealer's dream, so fresh and I'm so clean\nI'm a grown ass man and you're sweeter than sixteen\nSo go and kick rocks peons you're just rookies\nHeaded down stairs to get you some milk and cookies\n\n[Hook]\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!) Cry babies go home\n(Oh no!) I caught him with a blow to the chest\n(Oh no!) My hollow put a hole in his vest\n(Oh no!) I'm 'bout to send two to his dome\n(Oh no!)
