White, girl\nWhat's in my trunk? White, girl\nYou need a warrant, officer\n\n[Outro]\nYou could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't\nCouple basement stairs where I drug them, down\nIt's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face\nI'll leave you permanently blushing, blood\nNosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven\nDrums", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0b15e54db4148fb09424391967a73bc2.480x480x1.png"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
