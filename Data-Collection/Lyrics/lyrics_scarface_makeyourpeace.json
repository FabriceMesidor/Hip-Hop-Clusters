Let me know\nDo the saved souls travel the road of the\nSouls lost?\nHow come the dead can't talk?\nThrough horrified eyes I can picture the other side\nAnd though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry\nWatched my homeboy die, day by day body tired\nRemember, I finally accounted before he expired\nThey tell me there's a peaceful place, I wanna see it\nThey say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it\nAnd though I appreciate bein alive\nSometimes I wanna see how it feels to just die\nCome back and tell my story to the ones who really know me\nConverse with the angels and elders that went before me\nAnd satisfy the hunger for those who wanna know\nIf there's life after death, and if so, where we go\nI often find myself involved in deep thought\nI wanna see is heavens a place like we thought\nAnd Christian science seems to think it's just a mindstate\nBut before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait\nOr better yet, I take the journey for myself\nPut a bullet in my own head, it's my death\nSo when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9\n( *gunshot* ) suicide\nJust as I thought, a bright light\nGreeted by friends and family, so life-like\nBlack and in between screams and then peace\nLookin in the eyes of the grieved and deceased\nFather pleace, send me back, I don't wanna die\nI'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie\nAnd during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm\nAnd I woke up singing this song\n\n[ Hook ]\nI been a pawn and I been a king\nAnd I been down since the beckoning\nI try to look beyond the sight of sound\nAnd the lights come from the underground\nRarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound\nAnd through my quest for the answers, know what I found?\nI found that regardless to what people say\nThe shooters gotta do it day for day\nSo make your peace\n\n[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]\nOpen your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight\nAnd link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate\nAnd enter the minds of the ones who are blind\nAnd shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme\nI preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet\nCause everyday it's niggas lyin dead in the street\nWe stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days\nFuck what they say, cause ain't no comin back from the grave\nSo when the gun goes pop and the lights go out\nThen you'll understand what I'm talkin about\nI had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the makin\nThe ruler of this new world was Satan\nThe sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playin\nThen I woke up, my imagination\nRunnin wild but then again the coming of Christ\nCould be the moment of any minute, now or tonight\nSo make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast\nIt's dark in these streets\nAnd some might see it hard to believe but God is in me\nAnd yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness\nI know I'm protected cause I'm convicted\nAnybody believin in the Big Bang Theory\nAnd thinkin that thyself is the God, you need to hear me\nHow do you explain\nThe skies, the moon, the stars and the rain\nThe sun and the sea\nThe Earth without form facing the deep\nDarkness and challengin the powers that be\nIt's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds\nDidn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?\nThis heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth\nI'm tellin what few tongues of the evil will despise\nMy intention's to revitalize, still I revive\nAnd I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons\nAnd I'm on my knees steady stressin\nYou make your peace\n\n[ Hook ]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4214083902775e5126f0ba4f0770c9a.969x969x1.png"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
