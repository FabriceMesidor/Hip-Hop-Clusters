You must decide\n'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!\nThis pain is mine, and I\u2019d bleed for you\nI cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!\nBelieve me I'd die!\nBelieve me I'd die!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nHey!\nI'm the real thing they can check my stats\nAll over USA, Overseas, and back\nI didn't get out of this shit through crack\nEducation and motivation and just do rap\nBuilt all my fans, one by one\nThey lovin' the bullets coming from my gun\nThey do cry for me, digging the alpha me\nI'm giving the spirited heart from my tongue\nHow can you say my life is make believe?\nWhen everybody call me for rent, I paid the G's\nI create the \"C\" notes, we dope\nSo why the hate, 'cause he broke, we growth\nWhen I look around I see jokes\nWith a whole lot of boss and boast\nMaudie taught me to not be flossy\n'Cause these copies will doubt me, close\n\n[Hook: Liz Suwandi]\nWhat is real? You must decide\n'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!\nThis pain is mine, and I\u2019d bleed for you\nI cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!\nBelieve me I'd die!\nBelieve me I'd die!\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nHey!\nThey say my shit is glamour and glitz\nAnd all they think I'm doing is hammering chicks\nWhen I'm gone, they'll be slandering this\nBut when I'm around, you a stammering bitch\nJust give it up 'cause our cut is due\nTech lit up and it's better than you\nNever in blue, better than runes\nMade my money off of summerin' fools\nI'm the real thing!\nI can rap bitch!\nAnd I don't know nobody that's disputin' that shit\nPut on my mask, spittin' fast, get the cash quick\nHow does it feel to be real?\nIt's fucking fantastic!\n\n[Hook: Liz Suwandi]\nWhat is real? You must decide\n'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!\nThis pain is mine, and I\u2019d bleed for you\nI cannot lie, 'cause I'd die for you!\nBelieve me I'd die!\nBelieve me I'd die!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4392f3223b9e5965e7f76dc529941352.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
