Blige + The Game]\nYeah, let's take 'em back\nUh huh\n\n[The Game]\nI need a \"Real Love\", Mary, holla at me if you need a real thug\nWe could ride through Compton and see real Bloods\nReal Crips and I'mma always hold you down, that's real shit\nI'm the Los Angeles king and \"You Remind Me\" of Mary, the R&B queen\nI got the \"411\", what's crackin'\nWhat I owe you for helpin' me go four times Platinum\nI add a kid to \"My Life\", he's almost two\nI guess what I'm tryin' to say is thank you\nFor over ten years of the ghetto gospel\nYou've paved the way for young black women to prosper\nHow you paint pictures you deserve Grammys and Oscars\nCongratulations for me, Aftermath, and the Doctor\nSo niggas go 'head and envy me\nI'm Billboard's Top 10 featuring M.J.B\n\n[Mary J. Blige]\nWhen you learn stepped in this game\nAfter \"What's The 411?\", things ain't been the same\nAnd I can't complain\nBut with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain\nBut I'm so glad to be here\nAnd my music's still sincere\nLets get back to the story\nAll of this pain and glory\nAnd 94 was \"My Life\" and my life wasn't right\nSo I reached out to you and told you what I've been through\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n\nAnd I came and \"Shared My World\"\nBut at that point I was just a foolish girl\nTryin to find my way\nAnd I dropped a \"Mary\" album and people would say\nThat it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt\nBut my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them\nThen I came with \"No More Drama\", I remember that week\nIt was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep\nThought about it every day\nAnd it made me change my ways\nI'm a real woman, now because of all of these days\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n\n[Bridge]\n\"You Remind Me\" of a \"Real Love\"\nYou don't have to worry (\"Real Love\")\n\"All Night Long\" \"I'm Goin' Down\"\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do-dahh\nDo-do-do-do-do-dahh\n\"Reminisce\" on the love we had\n\"You Are Everything\" \"Love Without A Limit\"\nWhat are you gonna do without \"My Life, My Life, My Life, My Life\"\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)\nGo head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me\n\n[Outro: Mary J. Blige] + (The Game)\nRight now, I just wanna thank Dr. Dre\n(Hate it or love it, Aftermath's on top!)\nAnd The Game for pickin' such a hot record, I thank y'all\n(Naw, baby, we thank you) Shout out to Cool & Dre\n(COOL AND DRE!)
