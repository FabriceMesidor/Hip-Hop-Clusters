Sounds like an SOS\nHoly wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!\nTo the Rapmobile\u2014let's go!\n(Marshall! Marshall!)\nBitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!\nHurry hurry, step right up!\nIntroducing the star of our show\nHis name is (Marshall!)\nYou wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now\nSo without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)\n\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nYou're 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest\nMost rawest form, flow almost flawless\nMost hardest, most honest known artist\nChip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)\nLooks like Batman brought his own Robin\nOh God, Saddam's got his own Laden\nWith his own private plane, his own pilot\nSet to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges\nOranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes\nVrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches\nAway from you, dear, fear none\nHip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nLet's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)\nLet's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nQuick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles\nGee willikers Dre, \"Holy bat syllables!\"\nLook at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham\nWhen I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals\nSo skip to your lou while I do what I do best\nYou ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it\nFlow's too wet, nobody close to it\nNobody says it but still everybody knows the shit\nThe most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on\nIn eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much\nThey make it all up, there's no such thing\nLike a female with good looks who cooks and cleans\nIt just means so much more to so much more\nPeople when you're rappin' and you know what for\nThe show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all\nTo Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nLet's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness?

(Hell yeah!)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nIt's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo\nTwo old friends, why panic? You already know\nWho's fully capable, the two caped heroes\nDial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero\nYou can even call collect, the most feared duet\nSince me and Elton played career Russian Roulette\nAnd never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat\nPeople steppin' over people just to rush to the set\nJust to get to see an MC who breathes so freely\nEase over these beats and be so breezy\nJesus, how can shit be so easy?\nHow can one Chandra be so Levy?\nTurn on these beats, MCs don't see me\nBelieve me, BET and MTV\nAre gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy\nCan't leave rap alone, the game needs me\n'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear\nInto the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here\nBut we ain't fuckin' around round here\nYo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a \"hell yeah\"? (Hell yeah!)\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nLet's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)\nLet's get down to business\nI don't got no time to play around, what is this?\nMust be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down\nOn these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nSo there you have it, folks\n(Marshall!) has come to save the day\nBack with his friend Andre\nAnd to remind you that bullshit does not pay\nBecause (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay\nAnd never go away\nUntil our dying day\nUntil we're old and grey (Marshall!)\nSo until next time, friends\nSame blonde hair, same rap channel\nGood night, everyone!\nThank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)\nOh! Heh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9ca8b904ec93d8b18ae40892b5f29363.997x997x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
