I ain\u2019t shittin' roses\nWe in the same picture but we all got different poses\nNow I\u2019m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it\nI try to slow down, and I get rear-ended\nPause, like a red light, I\u2019m dead right\nHighway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?\nThey say you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing 'til you stop doing it\nWell, call me clueless 'cause I do this\nAttention all shooters: I\u2019m a shooting star\nLife is a course, and I'ma shoot for par\nSearching for today, instead I found tomorrow\nAnd I put that shit right back, man, I\u2019ll see what I find tomorrow\nYoung Money, CMR, Blood like a scar\nWeezy F. Baby and the \"F\" ain't for \"Flaw\"\n\n[Interlude]\nUh, uh\nYep, yep\nYep, yep\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry\nMarried to the money, a true love story\nOnly God can judge me, I don't need a jury\nNothing standing in my way like nothing's my security\nBack to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me\nIf I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney\nIf you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'\nI'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah\nNow what we doin' with it?\nKeep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it\nI know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it\nSome say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it\nOkay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point\nYeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice\nI'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser\nAnd don't call me \"Sir,\" call me \"Survivor\"\n\n[Interlude]\nUh, yeah\nUh, haha\nAnd they go \"yep, yep\"\nYep, yep\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, call me \"Killer\" 'cause I make a killin'\nI got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon\nThat's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings\nAnd them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'\nI touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails\nThese bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell\nBut they all on my wire like Stringer Bell\nI let them be, 'cause you know how the sting\u2019ll feel\nKnow how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail\nAnd I fuck up any track: train derail\nKnow how to roll, never need training wheels\nAnd when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills\nUh, all or nothing or nothing else\nI bleed reality, I should cut myself\nJust had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth\nAnd the \"F\" is for \"Fuck yourself\"\n\n[Outro]\nUhh, yeah\nAnd I ain\u2019t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air\nAnd Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers\nSo I\u2019m feeling alright, I\u2019m tryna stay aware\nAnd if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there\nTo my niggas in the game, keep the game fair\nPlayers play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer\nI\u2019m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear\nWeezy F. Baby and the \"F\" ain\u2019t for \"Fear,\" uh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36794982fcdfef6d2d2b62ec8bd80a16.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
