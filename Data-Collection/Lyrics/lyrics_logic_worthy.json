You can't comprehend the amount of heart that I'm givin'\nHip-hop's my chauffeur, so you know I'm driven\nSunrise to sunset, you know how I'm living\nYou see I think it, then write it, read it, repeat it\nThen lace it, produce it, record it, mix it, then master it\nSo the people adore it\n\n[Hook]\nIt's becoming something that's impossible to ignore\nAnd I deserve it, I think I deserve it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f21a1e2589d732e4a263527296e9f51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
