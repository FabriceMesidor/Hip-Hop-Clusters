And much love to you\nYeah! And it start\n1st and, 15, proudly present\nYou know what it is\nSee.. I got this philosophy right\nI think the world and everything in it\nIs made up of a mix, of two things\nYou got your good, y'know, and your bad\nYou got your food, and your liquor\nThat's right...Chilly Chill!\nYou already know, it's a long time comin'\nI give you my...I give you my heart\nMy soul, my mind my thoughts, my feelings\nMy experience, nothin' more, and nothin' less\nYes, FNF, uh-huh! So\nWith no further ado...\nLupe Fiasco's, \"Food & Liquor\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/373c57c9cfddd95f1d232784084809ba.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
