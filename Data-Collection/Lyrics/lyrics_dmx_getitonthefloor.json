and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw\nYou'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for!\n\n[Hook: Swizz Beatz (DMX)]\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nYou don't wanna party then your ass gotta go\nNow you can ride to this motherfucker\nBounce to this motherfucker\nFreak to this motherfucker\n(Let's get it on)\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\nGet it on the floor\nGet it, get it on the floor\n\n[Outro - Swizz Beatz]\nDon't start nothin', it won't be nothin'\nDon't start nothin', it won't be nothin'\nYou wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'\nYou wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'\nDon't start nothin', it won't be nothin'\nDon't start nothin', it won't be nothin'\nYou wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'\nYou wanna start somethin', it's gon be somethin'", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f488c6b50c388a38c157e4d53035b0b5.500x432x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
