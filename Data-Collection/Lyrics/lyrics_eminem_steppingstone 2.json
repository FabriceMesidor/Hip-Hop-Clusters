new\nWe were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof\nWe wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\nA multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse\nWe were so bulletproof\u2014wrote, souped and soaked in our youth\nThought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\nAnd at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too\nSo I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\nI was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\nHow to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds\nI just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\n'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\nShoot!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was never the same, and it's bothered me since\nAnd the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\nPlus we don't say how we feel\nAnd I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in\nBeen with you guys thick and thin\nBut it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\nWhich reminded me, Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\nY'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\nIf you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\nMore than try talkin' you into comin' up off of it\nI know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\nI think of all of the trips to BET\nAnd the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\nMaybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\nBut that's water under the bridge\nBut I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown to the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Verse 3]\nBacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end\nOne minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits\nYou can already sense the climate is startin' to shift\nTo these kids you no longer exist\nWent from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\nTo tiny drops, little drips\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\nYou start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed\nAll the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\nFor turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?\nA Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\nI ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\nBut it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none\nI just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\nTo my partners, I can't say how sorry I am\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\nI love all of you men\nBut I just can't be the guy everybody depends\nOn for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair\nI will always be here, but that spark isn't there\nAnd I don't know how to recapture that time and that era\nI've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air\nI'm barely chartin' myself\nFeels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent\nTo treat y'all like a stepping stone\nThough I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road\nDone all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\nBut the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\nThe less is left for closure, so let's let this go\nIt's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\n[Outro]\nI never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones\nI never meant to use you all for my stepping stones", "image":
