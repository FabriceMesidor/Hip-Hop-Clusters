Feedin my son is a must\nWhip it soft, whip it hard, in crack we trust\nWhy Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the 20, G answer\nCocaine been around for centuries\nSince I'm young, black and rich, I'm the public enemy\nRidin the bass drum, Just Blaze got the remedy\n\n[Hook]\nI got the remedy\nAftermath got the remedy\nNigga back up (back up) back up (back up)\n'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't no joke G, so don't provoke me\nI'm from the city of angels where that Jacob watch is a trophy\nAnd starin at that Hollywood sign'll get you straight jacked\n(Where you from fool?) Better say you pro-black\nCausin walkin in Roscoe's wit'cha chain hangin\nIs like Giuliani tryin to get rid of the gangbaners\nNow that 'Pac passed, tryin to put us on Death Row\nGet ready for the Aftermath\nI run through the city like Godzilla\nDoin mo' damage than Ice-T when he dropped Cop Killa\nPull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy\nThere go another victim of a one-eight-seven\nWho's the grim reaper wit'cha life in his hand\nEven the toughest niggas run when my gun go... blam\nSo kick back and watch the bitches dance\nN.W.A. is back, now let me see your motherfuckin hands\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm back by popular demand and so\nAll black interior on the cherry red six-fo'\nNiggas endin they careers tryin to shut me up\nActin like I traded in my khakis for a button up\nThe West Coast still dippin\nGame still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin\nSo what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana\nTied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke\nThey say it ain't good weed if you don't choke\nShit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes\nThree wheelin through the neighborhood\nSystem on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass\nThe key to drivebys is aim steady\nTurn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti\nWhen you cross that enemy line\nClose your eyes, parental discretion is advised", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8733b8e495bb8c50e53cd1da0aada2cb.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
