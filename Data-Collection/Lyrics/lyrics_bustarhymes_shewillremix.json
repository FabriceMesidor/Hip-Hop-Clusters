Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful\nLife on the edge, I'm dangling my feet\nI tried to pay attention but attention paid me\nHaters can't see me: nose-bleed seats\nAnd today I went shopping and talk is still cheap\nI rock to the beat of my drum set\nI been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet\nBut I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit\nNow jump up on that dick and do a full split!\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga\nAnd looked back, told me \"baby it's real\"\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go\nAnywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\n\n[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]\nYour head shorty, you can put it on me\nSmelling sweeter then the cleanest home, having the pool party\nShe eat it just to be alone and do it all for me\nAnd mommy working like she trying to take all of this dough from me\nNow let her go and get her bread and think about how much she know\nShe fucking with the realest nigga\nIt's why I think she throw the pussy at me until it's funny\nNigga need to be an octopus to carry all this money\nShe looked at me and said \"Let's get it cracking Boo\nI want to fuck, the way make this money and the music I be dancing to\"\nDiscretely she's imagining a nigga hurting it\nFinagling while regulating bitches she be working with\nThe way I murder shit, you should call a doctor, or shit call the cops\nFuck a car, my helicopter's in the parking lot\nShorty, and while you hope a nigga fit\nDo a summersault and land up on that good dick\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga\nAnd looked back, told me \"baby it's real\"\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go\nAnywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I tell her \"go on! Pop that pussy for me\"\nHaters can't see me but bitches still looking for me\nAnd you could take it to the bank and deposit that\nPut your two cents in and get a dollar back\nSome people hang you out to dry like a towel rack\nI'm all about \"I\" give the rest of the vowels back\nI like my girl thick, not just kinda fine\nEat her til she cry, call that \"wine and dine\"\nTry to check me and I'mma have em checkin pulses\nThey say \"choose wisely\" that's why I was chosen\nRocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault\nLooked in the face of death and took it's mask off\nNow I like my house big and my grass soft\nI like my girl's face South and her ass North\nBut I'm Ray Charles to that bullshit\nNow hop up on my dick and do a full split!\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nShe just started to pop it for a nigga\nAnd looked back, told me \"baby it's real\"\nAnd I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel\nI wish we could take off and go\nAnywhere but here, baby you know the deal\nCause she bad, so maybe she won't but shit, then again, maybe she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will\nMaybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will\nDo it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54314abfbbbf16253d72455428cc44e6.834x834x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
