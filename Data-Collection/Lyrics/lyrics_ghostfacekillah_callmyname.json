Enter the zone\nBuried him in front law. Put up a Tombstone\nI seen Bammy. That's my nickname for Bamboo\nShe like \"what up Tone? How are you?\nCan we speak? I got some explaining to do\"\nSee your absence made me forget who you were\nAnd I love you for you. I need a second chance, boo\nI say it's all good. 36 seasons was long\nYou got weak but I'm here to help weather the storm\nYou gotta just think with me. Shit'll get stinky\nI gotta clean the whole motherfucking city\nThe government's greedy flushing drugs down these streets\nThugs out here criminals dressed as police\n\n[Hook]\nCall my name when you need me\nI'll be there quick fast in a hurry\nNo need to worry\nThe all mighty GFK the master venger\nNew York's top contender, City defender\n\n[Verse 2]\nAy yo, these streets is political, analytical\nThe government got you on strike by the visual\nThe TV the crack epidemic. The real drug dealers, fake cops is true apologetic\n\n[Interlude]\nHow would you like to be in the court of law? How would you like for me to put a bullet in your head as large as a baseball?\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b7e8d5889ca7a25f1f186a54b799b1ab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ghostface Killah"}
