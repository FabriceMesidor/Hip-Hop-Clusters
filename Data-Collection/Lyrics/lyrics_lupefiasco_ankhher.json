What I mean? Idealize\nYou see the storm brewin' way up in the heaven\nA statue wouldn't mourn 'em, so I wake up to erect, damn\nAnd the bed made of women\nWho came first with a head made of chickens?\nBreak the fast, break the mask on a egg-makin' mission\nWith X-rated visions\nAnd the glass\nI wish that I could live inside jazz\nAs hecklers shackle magpie\nNote-blowin' standard\nScat over improvised ragtime\nRed magic, dead rabbit, energize me back dime\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nFeather me or let it be\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nTether me or sever me\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nDefinitely won\u2019t set me free\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nNo, she look like a set of keys\n\n[Verse 2]\nMay I die from a hand that is not black\nLie down my crown where Mike Brown dropped at\nAt the spot where he was unchained\nTo pour liquor on it and watch a King grow from the blood stains\nThen hug him, I'm just here, I ain't here to judge him\nI hear the jeers, the cheers, I'm adjusted\nIt's the day, it's judgement\n(Ankh:hers)\nFor the sippers and the drinkers\nLift her by the shoulders like hangers\nPterodactyls, there are damsels, in their fingers\nAmbulance chasers, bad chance, ain't no mash for the bangers\nAsh with a bad hand, cash for the danger\nBottom made of glass, shake that ass for the strangers\nI'm on the wrath with the danglers, shakin' my shaft\nYou just bass to the anglers (hooked)\nDrift to mausoleum, shackle my feet in 1919\nHollerin' droppin' cosmopolitans on the crime scene\nXenophobian, hemoglobin soakin' on white queens\nPale-face invaders to foreign devils and gaijin\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nFeather me or let it be\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nTether me or sever me\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nDefinitely won\u2019t set me free\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nNo, she look like a set of keys\n\n[Verse 3]\nHas the moon killed the sun yet?\nOver dim sum steamed bamboo basket bun sets\nA brisk run to keep the lungs fresh\nHung sweats on the radiator\nTwo shanks for the date rapers and baby tapers\nClear the vision with the spit inside the aviators\nLegit but quit because the lick promised them pits of paper\nWill we eliminate the innovators?\nWill we commemorate the imitators?\nYou are now set trippin' with eliminators\nLife givin' persimmons\nSo now your lemons persimmon flavored\nWhy you mixin' different neighbors? Spike it\nNow the wrists are slittin' razors\n(Ankh:hers)\nThe benefits of red wine\nDrunken box thieves fightin' bars to charge a dead mine\nIron wing Icarus, dip a bit, fly a Siamese chicken strips\nWell-designed to keep from liftin' shit\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nMy nigga, what's up?\nFeather me or let it be\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nTether me or sever me\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nDefinitely won\u2019t set me free\n(My nigga, what's up?)\nNo, she look like a set of keys", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7f2d27a17f74a37b51fb0d89a3785b3a.341x340x1.png"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
