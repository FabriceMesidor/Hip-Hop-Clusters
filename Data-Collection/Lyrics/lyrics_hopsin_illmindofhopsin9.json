Are you loving your existence?\nI wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it\nI tried to get a visa, I applied and they denied it\n'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'\nAnd now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do\nThere's a lot of land and water separating me and you\nYou're far away in Australia and I am in America\nSo I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does\nThis is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance\nYou have Hopson in your blood, you are special and you are gifted\nThe punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair\nJust know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (it's sad)\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nNow sing it with me, son!\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (yeah, that's it)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(That's why what?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you and your momma stayin' with her parents Bill & Kirsten\nYou're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous\nThey don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden\nThey assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses\nBut that's not true, son, don't be sad\nI know you're not like that, you know I got your back\nListen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother\nShe looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters\nOh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is\nBut that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks\nThe humps on Mom's chest, they're not real, they're elastic\nAnd if you look closely, you can see she's made of plastic\nLike a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend\nI promise we gon' be together somehow in the end\nI am very ashamed that you don't have my last name\nEvery night I go to bed and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because\u2014\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nYou know what time it is, son\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Verse 3]\nCurrently my life has hit the floor\nI can't lie to you, shit is hard\nI should be buildin' with the Lord\nIt could be what I'm missin' or\nMaybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more\nJust to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore\nWhen I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars\nThis was on my vision and you were the one I did it for\nMy relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue\nAfter all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort\nOur lives are so unhappy\n'Cause this world is cold and nasty\nJust know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family\nI'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived\nAnd now you have to suffer\n'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives\nYou're way too young to notice it\nYou don't deserve to go through this\nIf I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch\nAt least then I'll feel like my banning was justified\nLook at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)\nNope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nWhere's my choir at?\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n(Daddy doesn't fuck your momma) (Hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, son\nI'm sorry I can't be there with you\nBut I'll be there soon\nBut Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (no, no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma\nJust know that\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nOur lives coulda been so good\nBut Momma had to fuck it all up\nAnd that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)\nNo, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aad7931ec9383b8ae685459c1a19f028.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Hopsin"}
