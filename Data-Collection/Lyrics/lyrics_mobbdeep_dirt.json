When it's on, I know it's on\nBut shit not really poppin' and I'm lookin' for a war\nLookin' out my window, pointin' shit at police\nTo make matters worse, I'm sippin' on some OE\nShit got me buzzin', I'm already buggin' though\nWith mad other bottles that I drank about a month ago\nFuck is on my mind? I'm feelin' bipolar\nPlus paranoid, lookin' over both shoulders\nI woke up with blood on my hands\nFuck I do this time? Now a nigga scared\nFuck, I'll probably get the fuckin' chair\nGrab my fuckin' gun, a few clothes, son, I'm outta here", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
