Maybe\nShe bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear\n\n[Hook]\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell she asked me for a lap dance\nAnd Trav said she too fine, fat chance\nBoy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and\nI slap hands with millionaires and plus I got stacks man\nShe approached me slowly, holy moly\nChef Boyardee, cheese and beef ravioli\nHold me close, nose be ope\nHow much evil can dough provoke\nHow much she told me nope\n'Cause this one was on her\nI'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her\nShe slithered on me, put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating\nWas I waiting for the pushing, grabbing and vibrating\nBut this is really when my pupils got to dilating\nWhat kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing\nOver and over tried to explain it the best that I could\nShe put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said\nHgrrrrrr\n\n[Interlude]\nShit\nYou like that baby?\nHow about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did over and over again\n\n[Hook]\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\nEvery night when I come through\nThat looks like something that I want to run through\nYou want some or...?\nYou know I want you\nBaby we can have fun too\nI love the way you make it slither baby\n\n[Verse 3]\nSaid she needed 400 to tip out\nI whip out the grip so quick so we can dip out\nThe trick house, told my homies not to poke they lip out\nI'm going to rip out the guts and try to throw my hip out\nNow it's time to trip out, got at the bitch house\nWas three fine female roommates my homies missed out\nTook me to her room and threw me right on the bed\nGot right on the head, what a wonderful night it was said\nThen along came three 36 double D's\nSizes kissing and licking on me\nAnd they coming to do what? Wake my dude up\nBut one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood\nThen the other and the others\nInstead of bud lovers I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity\nBrought me here to straight feed on a nigga\nAll because I said to a stripper\nI love the way you make it slitha", "image": "https://images.genius.com/478a9ba0370b10241e03f91f6e741b36.1000x986x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
