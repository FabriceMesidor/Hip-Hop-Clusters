ha ha}\nTo all my people on the side jam on it {he he, he he, right}\nSo jam on it, say what\n\n[Mos Def]\nThe sweet old beats my speech radiates\nI grab the mic my voice resulates and penetrates\nI make the \"B-Boy\" emulate\nA buck-fifty still swinging like a heavyweight\nMe and the lounge about to levitate\nYou don't believe let me demonstrate\nThe way we make cats disintegrate\n\n[Voice]\nWell hold up you got to stop the tape\nYou got to prove you can rock the breaks\nMe and my man going to investigate\nThe whole way that you operate, cooperate\nAnd what's your name? {Mos Def}\nAnd where you from? {Brooklyn}\nAnd how you living {Very well, very well}\nDamn you had to say it twice? {That's right}\nSo you nice? {Damn right}\n\n[Mos Def]\nI rock the party all night all night\n{All right, all right}\nSo why you over here ripping with me?\nTrying to prove you position to me?\n{Some cats ain't equiped to MC}\nBut you can see I'm different \"G\"\nThe universal magnificently\nI rock the party eficiently\nFrom the Brooklyn Vicinit-y\nAnd I do it so lyrically\nThat you got to give it to me\nLike Rick James, I kick game and spit flame\nBurning rappers all up out their frame\nWe get into this vein\nFrom Brownsville all the way down to Brisbane\n{Damn this brother's flow is insane}\nThat's what I've been trying to explain\nGot no time to play games\nKeep it coming like the next train\nMake the party people exclaim\nWhenever they hear my name\nThey go \"Mos Def\"\nOh yes my style is so fresh\nGuranteed to win any MC contest\nOld school like the eighty-four fresh dress\nYou spend you assets to get my cassette\nNow that's fresh, the red hook address\nMake a cop jealous swell like abscess\nI'm shoutin' big love to Medina and the rest\nBout' to drop it on your block when I'm hot on the press\n\n[Hook with singing in backround]\nI said people in the front jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people in the back jam on it {Say what, say what}\nTo all my people on the side jam on it {Ha ha, ha ha}\nJam on it, Ha ha, ha ha\n\nTo all my people in the front jam on it\nTo all my people in the back jam on it\nTo all my people on the side jam on it\nSo jam on it, ha ha, ha ha\n\n[Mos Def]\nYou see my name is Mos Def and my style will never pest\nBrown skinned body-rocking MC\nI got the black zodiac and you know it's never whack\nSagitarius definatley\nYou see it's me and lyricist and we're getting serious about to make another hit\nI tell your homeboy chill cuz' his style ain't ill but it's straight up counterfeit\nYou see I'm faster than a speeding bullet and when I'm on the set\nAll the hip-hop fans just raise they hands because the one and only mighty Mos Def\nYou see I come into the party in a \"B-Boy\" stance I rock the mic so viciously\nSo all the real \"B-boys\" and real \"B-Girls\" never know others better than me\n\n[Voice]\nI said hey Mos Def you can't steal the show\nYou ain't the only MC out here with flow\nI'm the Pro-Castro and I'm letting you know\nThat I get on the mic and go toe to toe\n\n[Mos Def]\nWell cool young brother and just slow you role\nCuz' your arm's to shook to have mic control\nSee I get on the mic and jump off your case\nYou best get out my face and stay in a child's place\n\n[Voice]\nSee I get on the mic because I know I can\nAnd I'm fresher than you because I know I am\nSo when I jump on the stage you better step back\nBecause your name is Mos Def but your really Mos Whack\n\n[Mos Def]\nUh listen up little brother you ain't grown\nThe sun is going down you need to take you butt home\nAnd come outside with your whack freestylin'\nYou should have kept it in the house like Debbie Galler\nWhen I grab the microphone people scream my name\nThe ain't no sesame street this is a grown-man's lane\nSee you best heed my words and listen up\nOr I'm a tell your momma to whip your butt\n\n[Voice]\nWell you ain't my daddy and I'm letting you know\nThat you can't tell me when it's time to go\nSee I get on the mic and show you what it's about\nCuz' even my momma said knock you out\n\n[Mos Def]\nWell if you didn't know baby boy I'm a tell ya'\nYou need to learn to respect your elders\nBut since you here and you think you got skill\nThen get on the mic and show your real\n\n[Voice]\nWell I'm the devastatin' never fakin'\nAlways keep your body shakin'\nSteady rockin' never stoppin'\nKeep your body always jockin'\nRock the beat, shock the beat\nTill' it's time to stop the beat\nSteady moving show improvement\nKeep the party keep on groovin'\n\n[Mos Def]\nWell hey young blood that was fresh\nYou just got one hundred on your MC test\nYou got a soul-shocking body-rocking set you see\nYou need to pack up your bags and get down with me\n\n[Hook with singing in backround]\nSo jam on it, so jam on it\nI said jam j-jam j-jam on it\nI said were rocking to the bright early morning\nI said jam j-jam j-jam on it\n\nThis is the one to keep inside the jam\nAnd make you get up and just do that dance\nThis is the one to keep inside the jam\nAnd make you get up and just clap your hands\nNew York you got to jam on it\nAnd Atlanta got to jam on it\nAnd BK you got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, you got to jam on it\nAnd Miami you got to jam on it\nAnd California you got to jam on it\n(?) got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, got to jam on it\nChicago got to jam on it\nAnd Detroit cuz' they got to jam on it\nAnd St. Louis got to jam on it\nGot to jam on it, got to jam on it\nThe whole world you got to jam on it\nAnd Brooklyn yes we got to jam on it\nThe \"Lyricist\" just to make you jam on it\nMake you jam on it, make you jam on it\n\n{And don't you hear the sound...}\n{Mos Def and Lyricist Lounge...}", "image":
