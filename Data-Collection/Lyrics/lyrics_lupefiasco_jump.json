Get them intergalactic asses to clappin'\nBreak down some of that candy\nAnd roll it up in a wrapper for a rapper\nNah, I could never go back to trappin'\nAnd who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance\nWith a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can\nAnd at any given moment, I could burn this shit up\nWhy you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up\nHop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work\nI'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush\n(Nah nigga!) Nah nigga, I ain't in no rush\n\n[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]\nAyy, I thought you couldn't rap, when you learn how to do that?\nThen what you need me for, if you already know how to flow?\nAyy, fuck that, we gotta go, we'ldn't be in this hoe\nIf you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO\nBut I think that I can fly us, stole a key so I can try it\nNever thought that I would ever be a flyin' saucer pilot\nBut first thing's gon' be first, when we get back to that earth\nI'ma go back to them raps and you can go back to that work, nigga\n\n[Chorus: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]\nI already got the money, already got the bitches\nI see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it\nNigga we're goin' home, home!\nFrom a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper\nTrapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen\nYou can kill me, I don't care\u2014no!\n\n[Outro: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]\nAyy, look, the basic thing is\nYou can do whatever you wanna do\nLike I ain't 'bout to pass up on all this shit, you see this?\nLike we time jumpin' and shit\nYou wanna go back and do what, just rap?\nYou can rap up here!\nYeah nigga, just rap\nNo, you can't, nigga, this is Space\nYou can't, fuck that, we goin' home\nDROGAS!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/df21a5c133cedab6f30681d3578b81a2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
