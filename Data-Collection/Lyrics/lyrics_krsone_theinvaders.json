Esta tierra lo que nombraron los Estados Unidos que tiene la sangre de nuestra raza. Somos una gente ancestral, con un futuro feriante. Que viva Mexico!\n\n[Hook]\nHow then, can they talk of some border\nWhen they are the invaders?\nHow then, can they reform immigration\nWhen they invaded their neighbor?\n\n[Verse 1]\nAmerica existed before Columbus\nThirty thousand years ago we were here in Mexico\nWhere's all my Motiacans at? Cock your rifle let it blow\nBlow, blow, blow, blow, blow all invaders gotta go\nThis one for my people, my Mexicano people\nThe whole earth is yours and no human is illegal\nCome across the border every woman and man\nThe US is the alien, Mexico this is your land\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe see the same men living out like cavemen\nComing out the cave and them trying to enslave men\nHow can we obey them? It's better we betray them\nRise up like the reverend Nat Turner and slay them\nMexican people get your education\nTell your little children that this their nation\nYou own California, You own Arizona\nYou own San Diego, and Texas the Lone Star\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTake a look at Mexico, then look at New Mexico\nWhat is a New Mexico if there is a Mexico?\nAll of America They used to call Amexem\nImmigration laws are a fraud and we reject them\nWe are the Olmec, Toltec, pyramid builder\nAstronomer, philosopher, and healer\nMexican people rise up right now\nAnd realize that this is your land now\nSing!\n\n[Hook] x2\n\nGet out!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8219c6b423edb4d95b5c842a51f3b31e.640x480x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
