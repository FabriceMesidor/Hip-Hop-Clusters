Somebody just said something\nIs anybody there?\nI can hear 'em callin', callin', callin', callin', callin'\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5\u20199\u201d]\nClassical poems, battle my own demons, I need a glass of Patron\nBad as I need a horn stabbing my clavicle bone, I'm matador prone\nFirst time I seen a desert eagle I was letting the .44 buss, the .44 pop\nThe first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs, looking at Robocop\nI am not a man, I'm a logo, I'm a such thang\nIn order to clean my veins you need Saleen, I'm never referring to the solution, I\u2019m talking about more like the Mustang\nVroom! Get respect from the get-go, hello! Step to the echo, echo, echo\nPen got a mind of its own, got to write my rhymes with a timer\nOtherwise I\u2019ll probably vibe out to a nine minute song\nAs the echo follows the Maserati, as the petrol swallows\nI'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton, check your Bible inside it\nIt'll say this guy's an elephant, I\u2019m fly like I\u2019m killing the scene like\nI\u2019m a villain with wings, I\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m 6 feet deep\nRight now I\u2019m living a dream, though we may be reckless\nThe ladies check us, they whisper Shady Records, baby echo!\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]\nAll, around, the world, there's an echo\nAs, he takes, a bow, and they all know\nAll the girls, the boys, they chase the noise\nThrough the highs and through the lows\nThey will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c0c3c7e0aef3d510821c9890e36cf379.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Bad Meets Evil"}
