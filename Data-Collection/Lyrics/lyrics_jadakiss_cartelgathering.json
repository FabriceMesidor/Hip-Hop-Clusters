Whattup?\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nSam Cooke writin hand, all of my lightning, damn\nUsed to rob niggas in Sam's, buy shams\nFor my dude's baby shoe or booster baby, rollin with steel\nEatin Jamaican food under the wheel\nYou know the deal, book somethin then blow\nWhen from a O to a low, little apartment in Brookdale\nGold was my motto, lotto numbers is what?\nHad it in me, rolled down coolin with coke\nThat's the 90's, Chef era take over America\nBag Ugly Betty up, make her Ms. Guerrera\nPinky wench in sweaters, cortex burnin the mic booth\nTravel right past my heritage\nThem old school niggas is me\nTaught me how to read, get skee'd, everybody missin a ki\nYo I do this with a natural movement\nCatch me by the munition (aha!)\u200b, scope on me, fuck it I'm losin' it\n\n[Verse 3: Jadakiss]\nAH-HAHHHH!
