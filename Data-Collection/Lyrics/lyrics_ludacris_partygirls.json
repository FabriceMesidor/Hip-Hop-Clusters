No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?\nI lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?\nRun, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump\nThen it's more she gets, if it's more she wants\nShe's spoiled rotten like bad milk\nGet her hot cause I make that ass melt\nShe whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip\nAnd I'ma black belt\nI beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes\nAnd I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]\nThrow some ones on that\nGet you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that\nMake you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that\nLike pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr\nMy bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?\nSo turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly\nDoin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party\nMy lung's filled with Marley\nMy hands on your body\nAnd I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow\nYou can't speak\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\n\n[Bridge: Jeremih]\nI came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nYea, I came to party like tonight will never end\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\nLet's party again\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI need party girls in my party world\nTitties plastic, ass fantastic\nThey just brush my hair and touch me everywhere\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't say shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked\nSay shit and they be gettin' naked\nI don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8bac12a0a129a12bfb74aa4cf13ac39f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ludacris"}
