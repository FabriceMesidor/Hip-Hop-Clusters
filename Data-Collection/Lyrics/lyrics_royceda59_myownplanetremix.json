Can you hear me now you? You don't got a fucking choice\nElbowed my way into everybody's conversations\nWith rhyming, timing and patience, now I'm in space bitch\nI used to have to be on some watch what I say shit but now you gotta take it\n\n[Hook: Mr. Porter]\nI\u2019m on my own planet, I\u2019ll do my own thing\nThen turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good\nI don\u2019t need nobody else, I\u2019m gonna do it by myself\nSay what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it\u2019s all good\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nRight off the rip, the respect is demanded\nSitting on y\u2019all so you can\u2019t understand it\nI back a bitch down like a nigga chiropractic\nBack in this bitch like I\u2019m putting on a jacket\nMission Impossible, fulfilling all my tactics\nBoi! Until I\u2019m filling up a casket\nYou know, I think I'll have the souffl\u00e9\nMister Big Shot, Russian Roulette\nMy neck look like water boy, where is Bobby Boucher?\nBitches jump for me and I am not the bouquet\nI used to ride up in a put-put\nNow I rolls in the green, Tiger Wood putt putts\nYour girl used to be my butt slut, fuck my truck up\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m fucking Tiger sluts, yup so hold your girl close\nAnd scream B-I-G like she recognize a ghost, fuck with me\n\n[Hook: Mr. Porter]\nI\u2019m on my own planet, I\u2019ll do my own thing\nThen turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good\nI don\u2019t need nobody else, I\u2019m gonna do it by myself\nSay what you wanna say but stick to the facts, it\u2019s all good", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a82ceb80cafd67005a0181ac465481b2.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
