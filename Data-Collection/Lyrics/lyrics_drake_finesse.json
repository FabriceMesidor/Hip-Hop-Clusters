I can't decide\nFashion week is more your thing than mine\nI can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside\nI can't do suit and tie\nCan't be in a room with you and stand on different sides\nOne thing at a time\nI have to learn to hide\nOne thing at a time\nEmotions running high\nI wish you felt alright\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nJust hitting my line\nAll the time, all the time, all the\u2013\nYou stay on my mind\nAll the time, all the time (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nIt takes some finesse\nI seen you finesse\nHe can't know finesse\nYou stay on my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou and your sister\nToo hot to handle\nThings would get cancelled\nI would make time for you\nCommitment\nGoing the distance\nI'm new to all of this\n\n[Chorus]\nIt takes some finesse\nI seen you finesse\nHe can't know finesse\nYou stay on my mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2fee80dd9aec0717aef8e1eb7aaaae4c.809x809x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
