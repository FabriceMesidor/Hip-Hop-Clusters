{"songs": [{"title": "3 Verses", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners\nLooking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters\nI'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr\nAnd smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments\nI grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth\nWith a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse\nAnd ain't shit changed but kept the same mindstate\nSince the third time that I failed 9th grade\nYou probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it\nI don't promote violence I just encourage it\nI laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps\nAnd land inside a bed of spider webs\nSo throw caution to the wind, you and a friend\nCan jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again\nShit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out\nFuck it, you only live once you might as well die now\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns\nAnd metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord\nWarlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board\nAnd smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford\nBut I'm more towards droppin an acappella that'll chop a fella\nTo Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller\nGot you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing\nDeveloping anorexia while I'm standing next to ya\nEating a full course meal watching you starve to death\nWith an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet\nPumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs\nOn the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs\nWho were picked up in an ambulance and driven\nTo receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given\nA less than 20 percent chance of living\nHave a possible placement, it's a hospital patient\nStoring the dead bodies in grandma's little basement\nDoctor Kevorkian has arrived\nTo perform an autopsy on you while you scream \"I'M STILL ALIVE!\"\nDriving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp\nAnd pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth\nBetter call the fire department, I've hired an arson\nTo set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment\nI'm a liar to start shit\nGot your bitch wrapped around my dick\nSo tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with\n\n[Verse 3]\nMet a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg\nSnatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg\nGo to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40\nMix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D\nFuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead\nWait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead\nNo more said, case closed, end of discussion\nI'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion\nLeaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas\nCross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents\nAnd coming back to get your foster mommas\nAnd I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus\nCause I ain't making no more threats\nI'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets\nI'm more or less sick in the head\nMaybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before\nSaboteur, walk the block with a labrador\nStrapped with more corral for war than El Salvador\nFoul style galore, verbal cow manure\nComing together like an eyebrow on Al B.
