Los Angeles is still on the edge\n\n[B-Real]\nLiving in the big city\nThe American dream\nIs far roaming in the streets of greed\nEverywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more\nBut I ain't selling my soul\nWith the dope theres no girl\nI'm on a one way box to the top\nHitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block\nI'm in the fast lane and I won't stop\nYou ain't nothing but talk\nYou couldn't hang on the rope by ball\n\n[Sen Dog]\nThis life that I live\nIt ain't for the weak\nGot my roddy gangster that came off the street\nI'm trying to keep the peace\nBut I gotta keep my pace\nGot these drunk police\nWant me all rappy\nAnd I'm searching for the higher ground\nI want my head in the sky\nSo high that I can't come down\nLeave your lies in every town across the nation\nCause you can never stop to play\n\n[Hook]\nGotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nGotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nCause what goes up must come down\nSo we gotta rise up to the Higher ground\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nHow high can you get?\n\n[B-Real]\nCruising in the drop chevy\nGot my foot on the floor\nI'm hitting switches and my brim is heavy\nYou wanna look inside\nAnd see whos crossing the brine\nCuriosity is killing you\nWith stick in the prime\nI get high from the brim in the set\nNever gripping the square\nBut all you haters couldn't hold my\nDon't need a clip for my ? straight\nYou should leave it alone\nAnd check your toe cause my line will spit\n\n[Sen Dog]\nThis right heres as high as it gets\nSomebody likes it..the hell\nCause you stepped on the sex\nBut guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check\nGot my clock on deck and my custom vest streets\nYou came, for me I'm the best\nAnd you can keep the dress\nCause I'm smoke at the less\nTurn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed\n\n[Hook]\nGotta rise up to the top (to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nGotta rise up to the top (to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nCause what goes up must come down\nSo we gotta rise up to the Higher ground\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nHow high can you get?\n\n[Sen Dog]\nI go psycho, crazy Michael Myers\nExcept the stages on fire going higher\nCause when I lean on a flyer\nTheres so much more to make the whole city rise\nThis defines a man to get the whole world lifted\nWall man trying to make a land with a mission\nThere's no way you can stand in this position\nYou can't take the heat get the fuck about the tension\n\n[B-Real]\nGo with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor\nYou'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle\nWere going to world top, homeboy this is the show\nWe gotta blow up the stage be out the door\nSometimes we all nedd an escape\nSo when we form our track\nWell get your mind while we get the stat\nI made a pack with a crew on the hill\nWe continue to build with all the people who believe their bill\n\n[Hook]\nGotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nGotta Rise up (to the top, to the top)\nCan't stop (How high can you get?)\nCause what goes up must come down\nSo we gotta rise up to the Higher ground\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nRise Up (Rise Up)\nHow high can you get?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd46d2f8da2f05b27aabc6397c7f6e5f.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Cypress Hill"}
