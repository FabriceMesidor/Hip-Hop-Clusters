whatevah\nCheck it out man, check this one out\n\nI been rappin for half my life\nI'm twenty-eight now sayin pass the mic\nIf you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool\nI was born on the mic before you went to school\nTalkin bout pimp shit, you know whassup\nI wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff\nNow you're flowin like your name is water\nBut I'm ten years older and my game is harder\nI'm not tryin to say you're out there dissin\nI'm just tryin to say lil nigga listen\nBefore you grab the mic and act wild\nBitin on the next nigga's mackin style\nAnd it's all from head, passin round the mic\nNever even care who you sounded like\nSound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach\nBit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest\nAnd you gots no respect for me, is that right?\nWell jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight\nAnd keep rappin, I'm floatin past all the stops\nIn a clean ass Benz I have all the props\nFuck credit from a rapper can you match my Visa\nI heard your girlfriend was a real dick pleaser\nAnd a Too $hort fan, faithfully\nWhen I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me\n\nTo the beat y'all, and it don't stop\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\nTo the beat y'all, and it don't stop\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\n\nLet me tell you somethin bout a nigga named Short\nRappers always talk about the way I can't flow\nBut let me hit the mall with the same MC's\nI be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's\nWhile you walkin round broke, nobody knows ya\nLookin like you smoked a whole sack of doja\nOutside in the parking lot in front of the cars\nStandin in a circle with some wannabe stars\nFreestylin, but you ain't original\nYou just shootin everything and you pimpin hoes\nAnd to think you could hang with me\nI never would spit this game for free\nI'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-R-T\nI rock all stages and any parties\nAny my style is gettin bank\nGettin head, gettin hella dank\nI drop my top when it's hot and sunny\nSo how you talk shit when you ain't havin no money\nI set trends in the rap game bitch\nAnd gives a fuck when other rappers talk shit\nI know you motherfuckers, heard me rap\nSo hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap\nNo shit, the old bitch sucked a damn good dick\nPut them legs up high she couldn't handle it\nI'm not a no good punk, I coulda macked your mother\nBut Life is Too $hort, so I kept it undercover\nNow you're all grown up, with your partners rappin\nBut old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened\nTo a fake MC, who tried to get with me\nI ended his career, instantly\n\nAnd it don't stop, to the beat y'all\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\nAnd it don't stop, to the beat y'all\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\n\nNow let's compare the lifestyles, of me and you\nYou're phony and I'm all about bein true\nYou drive a bucket, that you bought for a G\nI ride around snuffin them fo'-eighteens\nIn the back of a motherfuckin big ass truck\nJump two rows back and get my dick sucked\nBenzos, Lexus, Rolex and Caddy\nFine lil bitches havin sex with Daddy\nI ain't givin no bitch, no kind of slack\nYou got one girl then treat the ho like a mack\nWhat's yours is hers, she don't trip\nSucker ass nigga need to check that bitch\nBut you're so weak, and it shows in your rap\nI'm out here, gettin hoes livin fat\nWhile you at home, gettin sweated by your mamma\nI bought my mother a house in Atlanta\nAnd you can't stand it, so whaddayou say\nToo $hort can't rap, no fuckin way\nBut here I am, workin in the studio\nAnd your album ain't out because you're movin slow\nBy the time you make one I'll be on ten\nHit the studio nigga, and do it again\n\nTo the beat y'all, and it don't stop\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\nTo the beat y'all, and it don't stop\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\n\nNow ask New York, can Too $hort flow\nAsk Detroit, they'll let them niggas know\nThen ask Philly, can I rap\nSouth side of Chicago, who's the mack?\nI never ever tripped on the shit that you spit about me\nEverytime I perform, I make a lot of G's\nCause I'm paid for this motherfuckin rap shit\nEatin good like a motherfuckin fat bitch\nEvery single day at the house what's wrong wichu\nEatin fast food if you only knew\nI understand though, cause I been there befo'\nEat any damn thing and got nowhere to go\nDaydreams, about bein great\nIt all started back when I was sellin tapes\nIn eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up\nWaitin still waitin just to blow on up\nAnd when it happened, I still had to wait\nI didn't get paid til eighty-eight\nI made nine albums in nine years\nI'm a true blue West coast pioneer\nDr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest\nAll that money we makin don't fault the West\nCause we ain't the ones who created rap\nBut when we made the shit, we made it fat\n\nAnd it don't stop, to the beat y'all\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\nAnd it don't stop, to the beat y'all\nIt goes on cause I don't stop rappin\n\nBEYOTCH!", "image":
