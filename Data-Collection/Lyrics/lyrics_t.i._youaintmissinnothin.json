Shit, you gon' blow it\nLearn and visualize what you tryna do\nAnd do the time, homeboy don't let the time do you\nThey say the time just flew in the streets\nHard to believe from in there but you'll see soon as you on the streets\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nProbably thinkin' easy for me to say from here in the booth\nBut they showed you, they'll put me in there with you\nRight now locked down in the state of the feds, lay in the bed\nPlayin' this over and over as you say in ya head\n\"Yeah... next time I'mma be straight\nJust count down to my release date...\" piece of cake\nMy nigga Cap right now servin' a life sentence\nFor a murder he committed in his self-defense\nAnd in such good spirits shawty ain't even trippin'\nAnd I could be right in there with him, no bullshittin'\nHe on his ninth year now just waitin' to get out\nGot me thinkin' my shit ain't even worth complainin' about\nCuz it can still be worse fa sho\nSo you waitin' on me to lose hope you got to kill me first\nI talked to my nigga Big Meech\nHad to tell him the streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets\nHad to let him know whenever he released\nWe hittin' the club like '03, this time it's on me\nYeah we laugh, reminisce for a minute and then\nI tell him just know ain't nobody ever did it as big\nIt'll never be the same in this city again\nClosest you'll get is me and Jeezy and them\nSo dawg, if it seem like you left behind, ten steps behind\nJust know it only get better with time, fa real\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ad-libs to fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cfd0caa9a36fd23db9dec05ae1a43aed.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
