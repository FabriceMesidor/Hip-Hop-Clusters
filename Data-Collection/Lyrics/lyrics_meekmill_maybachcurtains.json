(Yeah, we did it, baby)\n\n[Hook: John Legend & Rick Ross]\nLook how far we came\nThrough the fire, I stood knowing we would reign\nIt feel like yesterday when all this was a dream\nYou dreaming of nightmares, you dreaming of nightmares\nThrough these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed\nLet's go\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nThe chorus cinematic, going back to Cali\nYoung street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's\nJewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler\nI could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter\nDomino effect, you in that magic city\nWhere all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli\nComing from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly\nYoung legend outta Queens, take over city to city\nHonor thy mother, go to war for my brother\nGiving sufficient funds to significant others\nWent from poor now women screamin' for my signature\nMore war came from the bottom so I know the war\nNever worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm\nTalking cash over salads, heavy cro\u00fbtons\nCuban links equivalent to having suits on\nStretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on\n\n[Hook: John Legend]\nLook how far we came\nThrough the fire, I stood knowing we would reign\nIt feel like yesterday when all this was a dream\nThrough these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed\nLook how far we came\nThrough the fire, I stood knowing we would reign\nIt feel like yesterday when all this was a dream\nThrough these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c59afafa87c6a24df220df1e2af44f8e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
