Funk Crush\nYoung blood just hungry\nIt's no glamour, it's no glory\nIt's no joke no game\nIt's murder everyday, murder (Boogeyman)\n\n(They shot the boy!)\nThe murder of a teenage life\nFire from the cold steel, the heat from the brights\nThe temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath\nThe murder of a teenage threat\nThe aroma of sinsemilia dollar superstar\nScum of vicodin cocaine tobacco leaf\nEcstatic tap-less fire water and freaky-deeky-e\nThe murder of a teenage chief\nMy easy speaking is easy as it seem to be\nHungry belly drama busts off easily\nBalloon bang, pop, hot as a bang spot in Bangkok\nColder than a pimp Glock, aim shot the frame drops\nPressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop\nTake not life in vain, now how the preacher was saying\nRemember anyway they laid him in the straight box\nDark suit and gray socks the neighborhood is all distraught\nCandle lights upon the news report the families and students saw\nConfused in awe, they weep into each others' arms\nIt's murder\nNew absence from a mother's arm\nEven the warmth from the mother's arms\nCould not keep her son from harm\nFrom standing where the gun was drawn\nOver come done and done he gone, murder\nShell like a bell that rung\nThe blood burst body temperature fell and plunged\nAnd then the time it took the medics to come\nThe breath eased out of his lungs\nAnd his soul eased out of the slums\nAnd the voice eased out of the drums\nThe sireens they gleam they swung, murder\nTelephone wire sneakers hung, murder\nFor the black and young, murder, and the Ave they from\nI am from the block the president did not campaign on\nWhere the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on\nWhere hustlers stretch the yay long\nHustle hard for an outpost to trade on\nFlip it over and make more\nWhere the blocks are yellow taped off\nYoung bloods is trained off for obese to gray zone\nWhere the pressure just stay on\nBut the lights and the heat don't\nThe place where you witness the true power of street folk\nAnd that's where I'm coming from people\nHigh post low key eighth oz and kilo\nLaw man dope man adversary amigo\nPreacher man pimp hand both folding their C-notes\nA black fist clutching deliverance for the people\nYoung hand reach out, strong hand reach in\nChop the devil's hand to make the fucker stop reaching\nGhetto people know when the voice of true speaking\nM-Def, and foreal hold still nigga seein'\nI ain't got to say please, just believe it\nThe unerasable the black ink fact\nY'all fuckers know exactly how to act get back\nForever black (forever black) never wack (never that)\nFrom the K (Killa K) that's that (that's that)\nSo you can kill all the yap, murder\n\nThey shot the boy (3x)\nThey kill 'em all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50acba8e30cec066c838d6f22dd475e3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
