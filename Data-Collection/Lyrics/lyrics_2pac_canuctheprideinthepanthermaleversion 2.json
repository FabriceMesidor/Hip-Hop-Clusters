A panther\nWho am I? A panther\nWhat I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE\nWhat I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE\nRaise your hands in the air if you feel like me\n\n[Chorus: Mos Def w/ group emphasizing]\nWho am I? A panther\nWho am I? A panther\nWhat I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE\nWhat I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE\nRaise your hands in the air if you feel like me\n\n[Verse 2: Mos Def]\nCan you see the pride of the panther\nAs he glows in splendor and grace?\nTopling obstacles placed\nIn the way of the progression of his race\nCan you see the pride in the panther\nAs she nurtures her young, all alone?\nThe seed must grow, regardless\nOf the fact that it's planted, in stone\nCan't you see the pride of the panthers\nAs they unify, as one?\nThe flower blooms, with brilliance\nAnd outshines the rays of the sun\nOutshines, like the sun\nShines out, like the sun\nShines bright, like the sun\nBrings light, like the sun\n\n[Chorus: Mos Def w/ group emphasizing]\nP is for power, the A for action\nThe N-T because now is the time to get it done\nSee the H is for heart, and the E for effect\nThe R hold it down at the end for respect\nWho am I? A panther\nWho am I? A panther\nWhat I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE\nWhat I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE\nRaise your hands in the air if you feel like me\nWho am I? A panther\nWho am I? A panther\nWhat I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE\nWhat I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE\nRaise your hands in the air if you feel like me\n\n[Outro: Mos Def]\nThis song is dedicated to all those who live and die for the struggle\nPanthers, children of the Panthers, or all those, who strive for\nFree minds, free souls, free bodies.. for freedom\nAnd love.. love.. love is the engine to the revolution", "image": "https://images.genius.com/866e68770deafd17a70d2918c7819b81.817x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
