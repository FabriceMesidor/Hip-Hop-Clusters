Umm, new tricks I've landed. Umm, y'all don't really know nothing about that shit. When I say \"y'all\", umm, I don't mean none of my fans, I don't mean people who don't skate, I don't mean people who do skate. It's just a lil, you know what I mean, it's a skate thing. You run into a skater, he, he or she, they'll run into ya and let you know what I mean. We always think that y'all don't know what the fuck we talking about. But uh, you see how I put myself in that \"we\", like I'm a real skater? It's all good though, shout out my skaters!\nUmm, yeah, it's going well these days. I'm 'bout to drop a new part. I don't even know if you know what a part is. But I'm about to drop a new part and you'll see the tricks that I've learned. And uhh, when I learn some new ones, I'm not gonna tell you what they are because if I drop another part, then I already told you what tricks I learned. You gon' be waiting to see them shits. So, you know, now that go. You run into a skater there", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3622689a5172c789024942436b11dce2.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
