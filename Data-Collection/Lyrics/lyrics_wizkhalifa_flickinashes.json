Pole's Bic\nOn the way to see Marcella's,\nGirl I'm in another world and Chevy got another twirl\nFor those who don't know, he got that roll game\nAnd I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game\nFeel like I'm Soul Plane\nI smoke the whole thing\nPound or O.Z\nKush fiend, Purple, Master, OG\n(Yeah, that's a little bit of kush talk for yall' niggas who might not comprehend)\nAnd every nigga that grow weed should know me\nMy leather so soft, my swishers so sweet bitch !", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ba15f623d81eda09cdc07f50dde02ad.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
