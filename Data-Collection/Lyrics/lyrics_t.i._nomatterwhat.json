Yeah I know (haha!)\nHere I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go\nNo matter what, shawty\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou let the blog sites and the magazines tell it\nI'm sure to be in jail until 2027\nRather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren\nGod will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven\nSo even though it's heavy, the load I will carry\nGrin and still bear it, win and still share it\nApologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it\nLife can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it\nAll you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic\nUse it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer\nEvery obstacle, make impossible possible\nEven when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and\nYeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital\nBut when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do\nBeen locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song\nTo make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)\nI ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)\nBut still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people\nHere I am, yeah, no matter what, remember\nI ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)\nThey hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)\nHere I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go\nNo matter what, shawty\n\n[Verse 3]\nEven in solitude, there's still no hotter dude\nI show you how to do what you do, you ain't gotta clue\nAll you do is follow dude, sound like a lotta dudes\nI'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise\nI understand why, now, with my hands tied\nThey take shots, cause if I'm out there it's a landslide\nBut revenge is best served as a cold dish\nAnd suckas will get served, nigga, no shit\nGuess it was understood, for me, it was over-with\nBut I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet\nThey couldn't wait to say, \"Goodnight, shawty\"\nSo they could try to rhyme, act and look like shawty\nGo get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty\nBefore ya know it I'm back, what it look like, shawty?\nI lost my partner and my daughter in the same year\nSomehow I rise above my problems and remain here\nYeah, and I hope the picture painted clear\nIf your heart filled with faith, then you can't fear\nWonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?\nEasy, let go and let God deal with it\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)\nI ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)\nBut still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people\nHere I am, yeah, no matter what, remember\nI ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)\nThey hate me more (so?) Yeah I know (haha!)\nHere I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go\nNo matter what, shawty", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cfd0caa9a36fd23db9dec05ae1a43aed.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "T.I."}
