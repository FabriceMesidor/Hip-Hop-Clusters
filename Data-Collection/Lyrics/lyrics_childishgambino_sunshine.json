It means you're the one\nAnd most of these dudes are just fucking for fun\nGirl you know that I would never do that to you\nAll of the girls that I do must be beautiful\nInside and out, meaning your mouth\nGirl I'm just playin', this is what I'm sayin'\nIf you like real, then give me a go\nIf you never try, then you'll never know\n\n[Hook]\nOoh it's alright, ooh it's okay\nLet them all know that I got this way\nCause I miss you girl\nI wanna be with you, yeah\nAnd if the sun don't come out\nOoh it's okay\nLet them all know that I got this way\nCause I miss you girl\nI wanna be with you, yeah\nNever, ever, ever let me go\nDo you love me? Girl I need to know\nCause you're my sunshine girl\nCause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh\nBaby girl, you're always on my mind\nBaby girl, it's time to make you mine\nCause you're my sunshine girl\nCause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, I'm the man to know\nI'm the one to give you more\nMa, you got that stupid flow\nI talk about moms like Margaret Cho\nAnd I'mma go, minus the \"o\"\nSo I'm a g, sportin' a V-\nNeck and a check, on my shoes\nCause I got nothin' to lose, uh\nI'm in it to win it\nMoney so long I get business from Guinness\nDiving in green, I'm swimming in spinach\nAnd I'm in the race, who cares about finish?\nI\u2019m going vintage, and I\u2019m an advantage\nI\u2019m what you need girl, you need an advantage\nAnd nothing is heinous so I can work for ya\nCouldn't stand out, girl\n\n[Hook]\nOoh it's alright, ooh it's okay\nLet them all know that I got this way\nCause I miss you girl\nI wanna be with you, yeah\nAnd if the sun don't come out\nOoh it's okay\nLet them all know that I got this way\nCause I miss you girl\nI wanna be with you, yeah\nNever, ever, ever let me go\nDo you love me?
