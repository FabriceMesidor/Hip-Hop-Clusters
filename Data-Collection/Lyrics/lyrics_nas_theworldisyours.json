Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre\nYou flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?\n\n[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\nYo, the world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\n\n[Bridge]\nBreak it down\nIt's yours, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nI'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed\nFor murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded\nBorn alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne\nI'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home\nI need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow\n\u2018Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow\nTryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip\nPicturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip\nAnd I'm amped up, they locked the champ up\nEven my brain's in handcuffs\nHeaded for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom\nThe crew is lampin', Big Willie style\nCheck the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild\nStash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge\nWalk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames\nPlus the games people play bust the problems of the world today\n\n[Chorus: Pete Rock + Nas]\n(It's yours)\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\nYeah, the world is yours, the world is yours\nIt's mine, it's mine, it's mine\u2014whose world is this?\n(It's yours)\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nYeah, a'ight?\nTo everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours!)\nThe world is yours\nTo everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!)\nThe world is yours\nTo everybody in Brooklyn\nY'all know the world is yours (It's yours!)\nThe world is yours\nEverybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours!)\nLong Island, the world is yours (It's yours!)\nStaten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours!)\nSouth Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours!)\nAight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/607f57e6a9c537bbdbf0a3cc05f7b606.730x730x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
