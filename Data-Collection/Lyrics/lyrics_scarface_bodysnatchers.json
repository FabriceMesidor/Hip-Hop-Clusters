I shot a motherfucker\nContinued through the parking lot a lot of lights were flashing\nSome homey's must've seen me cuz I heard someone say Akshen\nHeaded for the vehicle my posse from the Park\nSome brothers from the Clark and my family from the Ward\nBushwick, Red, Will, and Shop\nNo questions asked, they pulled out their shit and shot\nYou hoes should've got back on the bus wet\nCuz I ain't that nigga to be fucked wit\nCaught up with the punk-ass shrink who sent me\nPut my pistol point blank, and popped till it was empty\nOne bad motherfucker comin at ya\nPeace, from the body snatcher", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bfc55f1e39dab482dd5f87425202cda6.453x450x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
