Great balls of fire, no doubt\nMy flame can't be doused, this is what pain's about\nLock all the doors and the windows in your house\nNight of the Grim Reaper, tales from the Crypt Keeper\nIT'S KANE!\n\nChorus\n\n[Method Man]\nFeel the tombstone piledriver\nYou hit the floor, thankin God you're alive-ah\nHail Mary take no prisoners and no survivors\nFound scary like a convoy of drunk drivers, ahhhhhhhowww\nTragic, that old black magic\nA-tisket-a-tasket, a coffin or a casket\nGrateful Dead, nightmares that make you wet the bed\nVisions of bloodshed dancing through your head\nIT'S KANE!\n\nChorus 1/2\n\n{*Method Man grunts and growls*}\n\nIT'S KANE!
