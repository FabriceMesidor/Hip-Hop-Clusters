Only time will tell, until then I'm thuggin'\nSpend my money on whatever\nRunnin' through this cheddar as long as my crew together\nPop Ace, pop tags, pop hammers\nThug Life, I put that on Pac's bandana\nLos Angeles king, tell my niggas in the bing\nI blacked out the car and minimized the bling\nUpdated the Ghost, went Nas on the wave cap\nAnd made wifey ring rocky, A$AP, yeah\nUh huh, let's go\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nThis right here reminds me of when\nThe playas had the dope so the girls brought their friends\nAnd every single night we did it again\nWe had a good time, we had a good time\nIn the city\n\n[Verse 2: Fred the Godson]\nI was forced to be a force\nDiamonds in my cross, the cost for me to floss\nGot me exhausted\nExhaust that's on the Porsche, got me wide awake\nJust make sure that my wallets caked while I wait\nThe coupe drop well\nGot banana clips in the Big Apple, homie, fruit cocktail\nEh Game what it look like\nI got the shorty and I'm playing with her chest in the corner\nLook like a rook, right? Hahaha\nThe city that never sleeps\nWe ain't talking 'bout money, we prolly will never speak\nLobby within a week, we generated revenue\nOld heads put me on the things that I never knew\nI'm big in New York, word to my moms baby\nAnd it's hard to be the Giant, just ask Tom Brady\nThat's why they pay me\nWhen you ask who the best right now, that's why they say me\nFred and The Game, peace, T.B.M., peace\n\n[Chorus: Sam Hook]\nThis right here reminds me of when\nThe playas had the dope so the girls brought their friends\nAnd every single night we did it again\nWe had a good time, we had a good time\nIn the city", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f04f9b2892eac01c8dd7876593883785.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Game"}
