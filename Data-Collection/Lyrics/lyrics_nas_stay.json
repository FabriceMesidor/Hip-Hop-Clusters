Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...\nStaaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...\n\n[Verse 1]\nPeace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors\nShout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners\nWatch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home\nMiserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone\nShe not the type deserving of a throne\nHer beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse\nMake me a movie first, can watch you on my phone\nI shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome\nFeel like a Knight from England\nThat's what I named my son, Knight\nHe was born to be one, that's how my game was won\nWhite 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue\nI'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one\nHoney be pocket watching, she got a lot of options\nHard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with\nHot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed\nShe got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay\n\n[Chorus]\n(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...\nStaaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...\n\n[Verse 2]\nEven though I don't like you\nNext Friday night can't wait to fight you\nLocked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you\nLast month I even bucked at you, you got locked\nI felt bad, wait do I got love for you?\nI might kill you but do I got love for you?\nI want you dead under six feet of soil\nAt the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery\nWe hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery\nYears ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy\nWe enemies but your hatred could never enter me\nSome seek fame cause they need validation\nSome say hating is confused admiration\nSpotlight on me, I still look twenty\nStill get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley\nMaybe niggas could see too much of they failures\nThrough a nigga who realer\nI don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay\n\n[Chorus]\n(Staaaaaaaay...) Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...\nStaaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh\nOooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45f91df35c8401e4bc8342304de2e558.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
