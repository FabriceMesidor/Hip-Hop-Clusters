One-time! One-time!\n\n[Verse 3: EDI Mean]\nI was born 22 years ago yesterday\nBut see, I saw no reason for me to celebrate\nLet me demonstrate\nEntered the world from out a poisonous womb\nHeroin bein' consumed, already predictin' my doom\nSoon to be one of the many misguided\nAlways the first one on the block to be done, tried it and liked it\nLost before I had a chance to find my way\nNow I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day\nCrime for pay, I'm on my way\nBut don't know where I'ma end up\nI swear to God, it's just a set-up\nAnd these are the words from the mind of a lost soul\n\n[Hook: 2Pac]\nJust wait until rain turn to sunshine\n\u2018Cause I hate to spend my life\nMy life, my life, my life duckin' one-time\nJust wait until rain turn to sunshine\n\u2018Cause I hate to spend my life\nMy life, my life, my life duckin' one-time\n\n[Outro: 2Pac]\nAll of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell\nTo all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\nTo all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\n\nFor all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\nFor all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\nFor all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell\nJust to see you smile and enjoy yourself\n\nThrow your hands up!\nThrow your hands up!\nThrow your hands up!\nThrow your hands up!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7893982cf65937e95b38b8d431dcf885.500x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
