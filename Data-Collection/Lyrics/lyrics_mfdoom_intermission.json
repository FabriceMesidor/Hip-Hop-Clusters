Now relax.\nRelax\nWhat do you want?\n(speaking Klingon)\nI don't speak Klingon\n(speaking Klingon)\nNo. Where is the bathroom?\nDo you know anyone here?\nNo, I don't know anyone here.\nAre you transporting Tribbles?\nNo, I'm not transporting Tribbles.\nI'm a Terreth! Are you a Klingon?\nYes. What do you want?\n(villian!)\n(speaking Klingon)\n(Well, thanks!)\nExcuse me\n(spitting noise)\nWhat is your number, Terreth?\nMy eyes sting. Now I can smell something. Help! Get help quickly!\n(crying)\nTo Terrens, this might seem a tackless way to begin a conversation, but among Klingons, it's considered quite civil.\nStop relaxing!\n(speaking Klingon)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f5cbd2ef557ed4f24781053ecd6a887d.449x449x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
