done it already\nAll that money on your mind I done spun it already\nI was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already, yeah\nPussy, money, weed was the subject already\nSee I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it\nFor my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics\nSee its TTG, trained to go, time to grind, no more CMB\nExcuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah\nExcuse my Spanish, but its no m\u00e1s\nI been working hard for no prize\nBut I'm still grateful though I show pride\nAnd you don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write checks to me\nThey can't put no more Weezy Baby out\nThat's that Cash Money vasectomy\nI still got love for my enemy\nCause I know its tough to be interesting\nI know its tough to be anything, but be grateful\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAin't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah\nTTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah\nI ain't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah\nI'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it, yeah\nAnd you don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write checks to me\nYou don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write checks to me\nAnd I still got love for my enemy\nCause I know it's tough to be interesting\nI know its tough to be anything but a hater\nFuck later, I want mine now\nFuck later, you done fucked up now, see you later\nYou fucked up now, oh baby\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nYou are witnessing, the bomeback\nYeah, put your money where your fucking mouth at, yeah\nI pull up on em bumping Keith Sweat\nThem niggas never see me sweat\nAnd tell the press I'm not depressed, I just had to press reset\nI just had to get me set, and I'm not playin' skip recess\nI'm a different Weezy, and I'm drippin' Fiji\nIn a Lamborghini with the seats wet\nHardest lesson is regret\nSnorting powder on the P jet\nAsk the pilot are we there yet\nHe said we on the ground, and we ain't leave yet\nHad to step back and take a deep breath\nIt's hard as heck to show 'em respect\nI love 'em to death but they ain't dead yet\nDon't know how long I'm able to repeat that\nMe I'm just tryin' to see the bread stretch\nThese niggas tryna see dread stress\nMe, I'm just tryin' to see the dead rest\nAnd I can't rest if I ain't pray yet\n\n[Interlude: Lil Wayne]\nFather forgive them for their wrongdoings\nFor they do not know what they are doing, Amen\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAin't afraid to die, I done it already, yeah\nTTG, trained to go, time to get it\nBitch I ain't afraid to die, I done done it already\nTTG, trained to go, time to get it\nYou don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write checks to me\nYou don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write checks to me\nAnd I still got love for my enemy\nCause I know its tough to be interesting\nCause I know its tough to be anything, but be grateful\n\n[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]\nCan't lie we blessed, safe deposit box where I hide the check\nWear a hockey jersey just to hide the vest\nI talked to God he deny the stress\nI make women cry when they next to me\nThey say they blessed to be next to me\nGive my kids my heart, put my mind in my music\nAnd I let them hoes get the rest of me\nCan't let this cold world get the best of me\nGot the recipe for my destiny\nYeah I want them mills like Stephanie\nWant the blue face hundreds preferably\nThis is the bounce back this is God's work\nThis is hard work, this is our work\nThis is all night graveyard work\nMan this beat is godly\nSo I'm takin' off like a screechin' Harley\nWatch the women wave cause I'm freakin' gnarly\nPercs and purp got me sleepin' calmly\nSo I wake up and I chase the check\n'Cause we ain't promised life, but we promised death\nBut we gon win, and I promise that\nYoung Money Records, you should honor that\nAnd my vicious city got respect for me\nGot killas to get at yo neck for me\nYou get the best of me, until the death of me\nAnd the second me gon be the better me\nBe grateful\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAin't afraid to die, I done it already\nAll that money on your mind I done done it already\nI was hustlin' already, I was fuckin' already\nPussy money weed was the subject already\nSee I'm TTG, trained to go, time to get it\nFor my woes, for my city, for my hoes, for my critics\nSee its TTG, time to grind, no more CMB\nExcuse my French, but you know where you can mwah, yeah\nExcuse my Spanish but its no m\u00e1s\nI been working hard for no prize\nI'm still grateful though I show pride\nYou don't see Stunna right next to me\nAnd I won't see Stunna write
