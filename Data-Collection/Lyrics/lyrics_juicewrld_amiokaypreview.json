Am I drowning in...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm so sick and tired of being such a liar\nRestlessness at it's highest, everything's on fire\nSorry but I'm not the type of person you should admire\nTime has come so I guess I'll just retire\nDestroying you obviously was not my desire...\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI never really cared what you said\nNever thought that you'd change\nNow I'm left all alone and you're far away\nGuess you finally found a way to run away\n\n[Chorus]\nAm I okay? Am I drowning in pain?\nAnd all this hate is driving me insaine\nAm I okay? Am I drowning in pain?\nAnd all this hate is driving me insane", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
