Oh you a solider now?\nI had these gangsters in here tryin' to get the [?] down\nPiss a motherfucker off is what's incredible\nMost Dope Army, I'm the motherfucking general\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nOn the grind, sick of working a nine to five\nEverybody say I look like I'm kinda high\nFuck it, you bring the soul and I'm gon' bring the funk\nI need y'all to but your hands up\nFucked up, but I promise I'm fine to drive\nI just came in here to tell you I'm alive\nFuck it, you bring the soul and I'm gon' bring the funk\nI need y'all to but your hands up\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nAyo, pussy can't hold me, nor can it control me\nPunch you in the face like I'm Sugar Shane Moseley\nRap boxer, ya I'm Math Hoffa\nIn between a field of dreams, word to Kevin Costner\nWho you know that's iller than Mac? Riddle me that\nStill hungry for success, here to give you the scraps\nTalking all that shit, get you kicked in the ass\nChardonnay, if I may, I'll be sipping my glass\nI hold the mic, slap you with my left hand\nTonight's the night, motherfucker, word to Redman\nPunchlines that will make 'em say \"Oh!\"\nIll so long, you'd think I caught the flu\nGot simplified, sicker rhymes\nUpside down, sixty-nine, twisted mind\nFarty kid in class who had to sit behind\nBet your dime, pretty fly, cruise right out of District 9\nPulling all the honeys, every time I go to kick a rhyme\nLittle guy, Marvin Wayne, bitches tell me all the same\nLife is what I call a game to into the Hall of Fame\nFuck you, it's Christmas though\nSo you can kiss my fuckin' ass by the mistletoe\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\n\n[Outro: Mac Miller]\nI said put you, put you, put yo' hands up\nYa, in the spot, put yo' hands up\nIf you, think it's hot, put yo' hands up\nIf you, down to rock, put yo' hands up\nYa, I don't make shit like this one man\nI just wanted to rap a little bit\nBecause that's what I do motherfucker!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
