That's a trademark\n\nI was at my house not doing anything\nHalf past ten I heard the phone ring\nWhen I picked it up, I said \"Hello?\"\nThe bitch spoke up and said \"What's up ho?\"\nI said, \"Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick\"\nEnough playing, who the fuck is this?\nShe said \"Janet\" I said \"Oh\"\nMet the bitch last week at my show\nI told her \"Call me\" and I gave her my card\nShe talked dirty and my dick got hard\nThat night I fucked the bitch three times straight\nNext night we made another date\nI gave a concert and she came backstage\nFuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid\nBut that pussy squeezed tighter than a vice grip\nFucked around and met this other bitch\nRight out the back I told her \"Bitch let's go\"\nTook the bitch to my limo even though\nHer friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh\nShe told her friend they fuck the best\nRushed the bitch to the back seat\nShe pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me\nShe said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out\nTook my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth\nShe kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it\nThe limo door opened, it was Janet\nShe jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit\nI kicked back and let 'em have this dick\nI told the driver \"Take me straight home\"\nThen called my partner on the car phone\nI said \"I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch\"\nCome to my house and don't even trip\nHe came over and we served the hoes\nFucked the bitches like gigalos\nPaula and Janet will make you wet in your pants\nBut to me, they're just two more tramps\nWith some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit\n\nShort Dog's in the motherfucking house and I ain't even tripping, bitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/354fed0b5f5b1d6e18186fae903238d6.930x927x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
