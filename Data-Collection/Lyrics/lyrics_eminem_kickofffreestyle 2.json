So nothing's off limits.\"\nI need you to spit that lyrical miracle\u2026 in the swimming pool\n\n[Verse 1]\nBefore this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees\n'Cause I\u2019m dottin' i's every time I cross one of these\nThere's not a redeeming quality at all in me\nIt's impossible, seems like an implausible dream\nPositive clean thoughts intervene\nBut they're all either altered and mean\nAssault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme\nSquashed in between a brainwashing machine\nLike an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical\nSuicide bomber that's seeing\nAriana Grande sing her last song of the evening\nAnd as the audience from the damn concert is leaving\nDetonates the device strapped to his abdominal region\nI\u2019m not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons\nBut bring your dogs, I\u2019ma muzzle 'em\nI\u2019m not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab\nAnd at least a extra large in a T-shirt\nHeadscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista\nI go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach\nAnd a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list\nGettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich\nProfessional shit sprayer\nBitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear\nEndangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce\nPrey\u2019s decreasing, I face extinction like disc players\nTold this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett\nAnd just stared 'til I made her think it\nSaid, \"Maybe we should just get married.\"\nShe's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square\nTell her, \"Turn around,\" spread her legs for me, then I hit bare\nLeave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair\nAs I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear\nSpray Febreze in the chick's hair\nMake her wheeze tryna get air\nI played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared\nAnd chained to me, and throw away the key\nAnd she'll be so afraid to leave\nThat even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there\nTryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up\nIt's impossible like rapin' a slut\nWe stay butt-naked and fuck\nYou're close, wait for you, what?\nMy idea, you comin' too, is waking you up\nWith smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup\nThat'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup\nHate to get bogged down in details\nBut bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females\nMy brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler\nI strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular\nShape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut\nAnd mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck\nOr helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub\n'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club\nBut if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut\n\n[Verse 2]\nGet a million writers inside of a room combined in it\nTry to get every idea of every possible line to spit\nEvery punchline, every combination that rhymes with it\nBitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it\nHead so big, I shot myself ten times in it\nTryna commit suicide and it, took five minutes\nAnd I survived the shit\nSomeone's gonna challenge me, who?\nBattle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too\nYou name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality\nYou fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale\nOnly time I start a movement's a bowel\nI can't even give a \"yeah\" or a \"woo\" when you rap in the booth\nNot even a \"nah\" or a \"boo\"\n'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew\nWhen I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too\n'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do\nBut that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nCreature from the Black Lagoon\nI reach up and I smack the moon\nYou're grief struck that I'm back so soon\nYour teacher for this afternoon\nCreep up with a pack of hoodlums\nWe pack a punch like Caprisun\nHeat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun\nWe stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms\nCup of lean up in the padded room\nJustin Bieber in a Catholic school\nSelling dust and reefer when your back is to him\nDon't adjust your speaker\nI'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo\nHuffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes\nFuck Christina with a plastic spoon\nWhile I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop\n'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!\nIt's fun for me just to grab a boob\nPlus my penis got an attitude\nMy fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood\nCome and suck a mean one like it's mad at you\nI speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do\n'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true\n\n[Verse 4]\nI just sprung a leak suddenly\nWhat I think in my gut instinct become in sync\nMy thoughts and my stomach link up with each other\nInk touches the pad, then boom!\nSince the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite\nThat's basically what makes me me\nCreating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink\nWho's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink\nADD, and better put out an APB\n'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street\nFor you to see Shady beat\nAnd I'll bet ya they'd need cleats\n'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat\nI pray please Jesus to make me decent\nInhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline\nI take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing\nI stay free of divas and ladies screamin'\n'Cause they keep schemin' on me\nVading keepin' the women at bay\nLike Laci Peterson, baby fetuses\nLegs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen\nIt's straight demon\u2014and wait!\nEven if it takes meat cleavers to make believers\nMistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant\nBreakbeat, eat her like steak meat\nEmcees take seats like AMC theaters\nDeranged ringleader, depraved king\nWho mainstream media hates\nWhich makes things easier, still under scrutiny\nVillainous smooth criminal, livin' room\nWith the nude Reese Witherspoon\nWho was bruised, beat with a broom\nIt's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it\nPit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it\nLive in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it\nR-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it\nIt's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces\nThe syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases\n'Cause my brain releases 'em\n\n[Verse 5]\nLike waste excretion, it's simultaneously\nAs I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues\n'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves\nJust to fill 'em's a huge feat\nA hill and it's too steep\nObey these demons, we're still in cahoots\nKeep feedin' me blank sheets\nAs soon as I sink these teeth\nAnd I'm killin' the loose leaf\nTime to shake these trees again\nWait, make that phrase repeat again\nKillin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again\nGet the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em\n\n[Verse 6]\nVicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them\nThe whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons\nAnd I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks\nOn the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance\nWho I influence I give two shits\nIf they wanna license my music to entice with\nThen use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment\n\n[Verse 7]\nExcuse me while I stare into space for a few\nIn a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon\nMental cased off, always had a straight-forward view\nBut you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel\nNo one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude\nBeast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it\nAnd this has little to do with bein' gay, boy\nIt's just where the wordplay's goin'\nBut ain't much I can say or do\n'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}\nYou say I'm always screw-faced\nSo if I look your way, you're screwed\n'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too\n'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you\n\n[Verse 8]\nLet's take it back before the tightly-worn pants\nTo the Nike, Jordan, hats\nThe stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees\nLightning storms might be formed fast\nSuch a frightening forecast\nBut when you're slightly hoarse, rasp\nFrom the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps\nWhile you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past\n'Cause your heiny's sore, that's\n'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass\nFrom the night before last\nNo good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at\nFuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat\nWhere your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact\nThey're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?\nSo big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back\n\n[Verse 9]\nDick so long, need a shoulder-strap\nFor that, gotta unroll it and fold it back\nSo difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it\nSo I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat\nMake a bitch think she's in aerobics class\nThe bear you don't wanna poke is back\nThe backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks\nWhen I appear, my peers stop\nHearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop\nCareers flop, their gears lock, severe shock\nFear at the mere thought\nLyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top\nI'm in the sky when I talk\nBitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop\n\n[Outro]\nOh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you\nI got an idea for a line", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4c866cf35ceefa4a1652efd8e69b297b.480x360x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
