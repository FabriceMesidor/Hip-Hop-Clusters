In fact, God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up. In other words, God is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\". African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying \"thank you\" or \"no thank you\" and other forms of common courtesy.
