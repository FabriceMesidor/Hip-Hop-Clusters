You think ya better? Oh please\nNose to me, and you get what come out of coca leaves\n'posed to be, high and mighty toilet bowl to breathe\nSocially those hidden without rose to be nosily\nPut they schnauz on the old tussy, if my odor be stinkin' but they notice me\nBein' better than ever fresher than a lotus leaf nigga\n\n[Hook]\nAll my life\nI wasn't good enough\nNow my shit don't stink\nNow my shit don't stink\nNow my shit don't stink", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a97c6b9421fc6142eef43b7f37277096.500x501x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
