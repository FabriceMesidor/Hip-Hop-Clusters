Oh it's the boss\nMaking sure no one is taking a loss\nOn his multi-thousand dollar operation\nBut how does he thank them for their participation\nWhatever the pay, it's still not enough\nCause what they got into is some serious stuff\nHours a day back and forth on the strip\nSending customers far on a trip\nAnd this roots of all evil brings about war\nCause you wanna open up another crack store\nChildren can't play in the parks and things\nBecause a stray bullet might be headed for the swings\nYou never though about that, oh I guess not\nAll you thought about was owning your own spot\nTo putting more and more people to sleep\nBut ya heading for a pothole six feet deep\nYou see the problem has gotten more serious\nAnd the community is getting more furious\nGet it deep in your head I told you so\nIt goes way beyond just saying no\n\nChorus: Stop the nonsense\n\nRemember Steve with the blue Jag?\nThey found him cut up and stuffed in a bag\nHe had his own operation uptown\nAnd there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down\nIn other words he was living foul\nShootin up neighborhoods acting wild\nHe said he had to protect his drug trade\nWhich we manufactured throughout arcades\nHe made sure his enemies felt the pain\nWhoever he felt was a threat, got slain\nLike Donna, who was only sixteen\nAnd she was employed on another drug scene\nShe try to set up a hit on Steve\nBut he sliced her throat until she could not breathe\nThis is what happens when you deal\nYou don't care on who you got to kill\nI might walk outside and get shot\nBecause I live next door to a drug spot\nAnd I don't need this stuff in my vicinity\nOf me being shot for mistaken identity\nThis is the stuff that Steve was on\nNow he's dead long and gone\n\nChorus: With his old nonsense", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2hbqfa2xwvnb8hpdpe5u35cz.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "GZA"}
