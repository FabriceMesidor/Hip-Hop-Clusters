Hehe\n'Round my motherfuckin' way\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears\n\u2018Cause shit was hectic for me last year\nIt appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breast\nThe underlying cause of my arrest: my life is stressed\nAnd no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary\nFor all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery\nShit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary\nBut at times unnessecary, I'm gettin' worried\nTeardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic\nAnd certain death for us ghetto bastards\nWhat can we do when we're arrested but open fire?\nLife in the pen ain't for me \u2018cause I'd rather die\nBut don't cry through your despair\nI wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare\nAnd who cares if we survive?\nThe only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a 4-5\nMy neighborhood ain't the same, \u2018cause all these little babies goin' crazy and they sufferin' in the game\nAnd I swear it's like a trap\nBut I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back\nHoes show me love, niggas give me props\nForever hot, \u2018cause it don't stop \u2013 on my block\n\n[Hook]\nLivin' life is but a dream\nHard times is all we seen (on my block)\nEvery block is kind to me\nBut on the block we still pray\nBut on the block we still pray\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow shit's constantly hot on my block\nIt never fails to be gunshots\nCan't explain a mother's pain when her son drops\nBlack males livin' in hell, when will we prevail?\nFearin' jail, but crack sales got me livin' well\nAnd in a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life\nStayin' strapped, forever trapped in this drug life\nGod, help me, \u2018cause I'm starvin', can't get a job\nSo I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard\nCan't sleep \u2018cause all the dirt make my heart hurt\nPut in work and shed tears for my dead peers\nMislead from childhood where I went astray\n'Til this day I still pray for a better way\nCan't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke\nFrom the start, I felt the racism \u2018cause I'm dark\nCouldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent\nHit the bar and played the star everywhere I went\nIn my heart I felt alone, out here on my own\nI close my eyes and picture home \u2013 on my block\n\n[Hook]\nLivin' life is but a dream\nHard times is all we seen (on my block)\nEvery block is kind to me\nBut on the block we still pray\nBut on the block we still pray\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die\nCaught strays from AK's in a drive-by\nSwollen pride and homicide don't coincide\nBrothers cry for broken lives \u2013 Mama, come inside!\n\u2018Cause our block is filled with danger\nUsed to be a close knit community\nBut now we're all cold strangers\nTime changes us to stone, them crack pipes\nAll up and down the block exterminatin' black life\nBut I can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels\nShit's real, I know you feel my tragedy\nA single mother with a problem child, daddy free\nHangin' out, pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor\nGamin' the hoochies, hopin' I can get to sleep with her\nIt's a man's world, stayin' strapped\nFantasies of a nigga livin' phat but held back\nPipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless\nWide eyed and losin' focus \u2013 on my block\n\n[Hook]\nLivin' life is but a dream\nHard times is all we seen (on my block)\nEvery block is kind to me\nBut on the block we still pray\nBut on the block we still pray\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd block parties in the projects lastin' way past daylight\nA young nigga learned to break, right?\nUsed to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen\nI send them ends, but it's tough on a friend\nIn my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'\nAlcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call\nI know the young niggas understand this\nGrowin' up in this world where everything is scandalous\nI reminisce on the fast times, past crimes\nTryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime\nCan't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game\nGold chains, some extra change, and the street fame\nAnd what's strange is everybody know my name\nSwear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change\nI hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain\nFor all the niggas that I lost to the game \u2013 from my block\n\n[Hook]\nLivin' life is but a dream\nHard times is all we seen (on my block)\nEvery block is kind to me\nBut on the block we still pray\nBut on the block we still pray\n\n[Outro]\nRest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away\nFrom all the blocks that I'm from\n112 street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?\n183rd and Walt, my block \u2013 that's right\n122nd and Morningside, my block \u2013 that's right\nDecatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block \u2013 that's right\nAnd the Jungle, Marin City, that's my block \u2013 that's right\nLos Angeles, haha \u2013 that's my block too\nOakland, can't forget Oaktown \u2013 that's my block for sure\nAnd all the other blocks around this motherfucker\nHouston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago\nAll y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust\nRepresent the motherfuckin' block", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f7dcd7bb697e66f11fe0520838cb066.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
