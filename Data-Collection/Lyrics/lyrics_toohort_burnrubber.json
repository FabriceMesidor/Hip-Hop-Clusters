Might make you lose your mind\nThat's why I run these gray girls, two at a time\nWith no discretion, to me you're so depressin\nActin like you don't know, my profession\nI look at them thighs, and look at them titties\nTake your ass straight on out, of Sin City\nWearin all pink just like Hello Kitty\nBringin back all C-notes and no fifties\n\n{*scratched: \"so damn..\" \"..fresh\", \"word\"*}\n\n[Verse 2]\nBurnin rubber on these bitches, so fast..\nBurn rubber as you smash all fast\nTell it like $hort, no ass, no pass\nAll you Santa Claus players, be on your way\nWith a bag full of toys on the back of your sleigh\nYou hit your girls house, one by one\nClimb down the chimney, and give 'em all somethin\nYou trick, don't come around me frontin\nTalkin 'bout how you pimpin givin hoes what they wantin\nYou worse than a studio gangsta\nBehind closed doors, gettin his bootyhole spanked up\nYou suckers disrespect the game\nAll these video hoes out there spittin your name\nYou love it when they make that, ass clap\nBut she don't give me no cash, I'll pass it back\n... I kick her where she stash the crack\nIn the plastic sack, when she crash the 'llac\nPunk bitch!\n\n{*scratched: \"so damn..\" \"..fresh\", \"word\"*}\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey tryin to give the rap game to some real punks\nIt's just like when disco, killed the funk\nCan't tell me nothin, when I know I'm right\nLike a bowlegged bitch with a overbite, that suck it right\nPlayer this pimp don't lie\nHow many porn stars you know that went to Crenshaw High?\nA lot of fuckin for a whole lot of nuttin\nYou just wannabe noticed so you're out there sluttin\nI never really cared about popular fame\nIt's all about sittin on top of the game\nSo don't stop 'til your panties drop\nFuck the mayor, the preacher, and a cop\nYou better tell him what it cost, get his mind on track\nCause he look like he lost\nBring him back, and dig in his pockets quick\nSteal his watch, and make sure he got a drop, beotch\n\n{*scratched: \"so damn..\" \"..fresh\", \"word\"*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ed8e96dec66a7ff4b3234c0368a7f843.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Too $hort"}
