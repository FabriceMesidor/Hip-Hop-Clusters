'Cause I'm lit\u2014narrow minded\nBut go through such a wide range of this emotion\nThat my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways\nI just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway\nWith his personal memoir, saying \"He's bi!\"\nWaving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride\nMaking him cry, \"Rape!\"\u2014then arrive naked\nAnd drive straight through the gay pride parade\n\"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!\", 'cause here I\u2014\nWait, did the world just pee on my leg?\nAnd should I take it as a sign\nMaybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)\nI stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger\nTo take the attention away\nFrom my stinking face it was bringing\nChanged the whole complexion of the game\nBut just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing\nThe kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then\nSo if this is any indication, of what you may be facing\nYou better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations\nAre leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression\nThat's the worst impersonation I've ever seen\nWho raps nasally? Eyes hazely?\nRhymes crazily, but sounds like he may\nNeed some Flonase when he's speaking?\nWhat kind of stupid question is that?\n\"Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!\nOther than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking\nHow'd you think that play was this weekend?\"\nYou ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot\nSee me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown\nRich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate\nTo come fuck up the whole party\nMe and Flipmode starting a campaign\nTo have every campus, on a fucking rampage\nAct my goddamn age? I am\u2014eight!\nSo let's get smashed and wake up the next day\nWith the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids\nGlass ashtray smashed\nChampagne splashed on the lampshades\nBut this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable\nShady for president ho, don't make me go take it back\nTo the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio\nWhen I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD\nI almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show\nFuck you telling me, fools?\nI was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's\nWhen Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs\nMe and Bus put it down, like a sick pet\nYou're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers\n\"I sit in front of my computer all day\nAnd comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks\u2014play the next song!\"\nGuess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick\nWith Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong\nSon of God; I'm the S.O.G\nLike a wet log, pores never get clogged\n'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog\nYes, yes, y\u2019all (Wah!)\u2014steady on the left, y\u2019all\nStep off, 'fore you get stepped on\nSoft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet\nJealousy\u2019ll get you green as a Chia Pet\nI can see that you\u2019re visibly upset, dog\nAlert, alert, girl\u2014alert\nOnce you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt\nSo (\"Jump around! Jump! Jump!\")\nGet that ass shaking (\"Jump around! Jump!\")\nCame to hit you, with a fan favorite\nBut if you too fly for coach better get them arms\nAnd freaking hands flailing and (\"Jump!\")\nLike Van Halen and pray for a damn tailwind\nMore afraid of success, than I am of failure\nSo what does that tell ya?\nThat on a grand scale, I don\u2019t give a fuck about nothing\nLike Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail\nBefore he ran straight into the damn railing\n\n[Outro: Sample]\n\"Yo, chill, man\u2014chill!\"\n\n[Produced by Scoop DeVille]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2b432c2f6c35eb41ac44513c8d3337b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
