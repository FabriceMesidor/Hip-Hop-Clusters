For women..\nMen, you shouldn't listen to your selfish heart\nIt doesn't really have a brain\nBesides keepin you alive, it's existence is in vain\nAnd how could I be so mean, and say your heart has no place?\nBecause mortal men fall in love again\nAs fast as they change their face\nI may be cruel, but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken\nAnd match that, with the empty vows and broken promises you've spoken\nNow I'm not saying females are perfect\nCause we know, it's not true\nBut why must you be unfaithful\nIf her heart is true to you?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/866e68770deafd17a70d2918c7819b81.817x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
