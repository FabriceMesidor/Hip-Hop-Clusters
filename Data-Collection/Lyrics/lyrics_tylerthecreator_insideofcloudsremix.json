Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'\nWanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn\nSnorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin\nProbably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins\nIt's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin\nAnd play some Sade \"Love Deluxe\" through my headset\nOn my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella\nWhy? Cause I really didn\u2019t wanna get my shit wet\nRun through the puddles, playin' in the mud\nFun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub\nOr I would get my toys and make a lotta noise\nWhile my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal\nFire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up\nSippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nI can smell it when I go outside\nThen it just pours\nIt gives us peace then all in the town is quiet\nThat's what rain's for\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell]\nAll the kids see rain and scream \"No, no\"\nRun off the bus and they will just stay in\nMe I love how rain fills the potholes\nMe and my sailboat, that's what we played in\nEver wonder exactly where the sun goes\nDid it go or did somethin' shade it?\nThe sun gives light cause it is the window\nThe rain gives life cause it is amazin'\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler]\nLightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike\nI am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain\nLights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites\nHere's an idea, why don't I go hiking\nOn a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing\nStand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch\nAnd eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream\nGet sick and then I won't have to\nGo to school today, tomorrow, the day after\nSit in bed, write a bunch of raps up\nAnd I won't be lyin' when I say I\u2019m a sick rapper\nI might fail so I won't bother\nThe sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father\nThe only difference is it comes back, full effect\nIn the summer heats up, the thermometers erected\n\n[Outro: Pharrell]\nThe inside of clouds\nThat's the window into the sky\nProves there's life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/610384882ca6311db99de4fbfcdf2b46.421x421x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tyler, The Creator"}
