Wha...\n\nThe running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds\nTerrified.  The devil's laughing is getting much louder\n\nThere is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying\nTo hide and everything is in his way\n\nScared Man: What you want man?  What you want from me?\n\nDevil:  Your soul!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b2afc0b2ec12b84597cab495ffdf0e1.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Coolio"}
