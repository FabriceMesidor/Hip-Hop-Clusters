Thug 'til I die!\n\n[Chorus]\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G\nBe a lie If I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G\nBe a lie If I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on\n\n[Verse 3]\nBury me smilin' with G's in my pocket\nHave a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it\nLet the hoes that I used to know\nFrom way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe\nGive me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin\nA couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in\nTell all my people I'm a Ridah\nNobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride\nUntil I get free\nI live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me\nTo my niggas from old blocks, from old crews\nNiggas that guided me through back in the old school\nPour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies\nSee, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me\nAnd brothers miss you while you gone\nYou left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on\n\n[Chorus]\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G\nBe a lie If I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G\nBe a lie If I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on\n\n[Outro]\nLife goes on, homie\nGone on, 'cause they passed away\nNiggas doin' life\nNiggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit\nI feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you\nYou know what I mean?\nLast year we poured out liquor for ya\nThis year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now\nGet money, evade bitches, evade tricks\nGive playa haters plenty of space\nAnd basically just represent for you, baby\nNext time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga\nYou gon' be like, \"Goddamn, them niggas came up!\"\nThat's right, baby, life goes on\nAnd we up out this bitch\nHey, Kato!
