You choose your  crew\nI have time for one day of what we used to do\nI could look in your eyes didn't see demons\nNow I look in your eyes and empty dreams\nIs it really that bad\nYou really that mad\nNow I think you say anything for cash\nBut I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nA loner touch stoner\nNow Katika think that I don't want her?\nListen baby girl daddy's stressed out\nBut I'mma get my game together and stick my chest out\nYou feel left out\nI know the feelin\nIn a run like my dad seemed so appealing\nSo tip to mom and tell her I'm comin\nAnd Darcell on the real you a hell of a woman\nAnd knowing that I love you Obie Trice\nCuz Sharonda you family with Sonya Rice\nFour women and one cousin\nThat's why I praise Marshall for givin me one dozen\nIn this life you only need one cousin\nI got no kick it tho for no jealous lovin\nWe fam and i gonna punch ya jaw\nJust know that my heart be bump for ya'll\nAnd I love you\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet me see where I left off\nMy house is tight\nNow I gotta clean my steps off\nI back every move that the dozen does\nUndertaker we straight 'n for us it's love\nIf there's beef I don't care I know where to check\nEinstein's my man and I can respect that\nAkreem (?) it seems you hate me now\nWe friends till the end or until God take me out\nLola and Helluva, listen to the Big Pro\nDon't bygone the unity when you get dough\nDon't duck up the backdoor when you get low\nThat's what you big bro was here for\nDogmatic Raw C, Wit and Pep, S Cazza, Big Rick and Hex\nListen poor or rich we know bylaws\nNo matter what ya'll do ya'll still my dawgz\nI love ya'll", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a168ce2b6c86a86cfb53a6d996cdc8ca.304x400x1.png"}], "artist": "Proof"}
