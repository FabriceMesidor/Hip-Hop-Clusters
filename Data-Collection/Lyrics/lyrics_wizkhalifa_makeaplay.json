Donato]\nWho trying to pour it(ay, ay)\nWho trying to wake and bake(ay)\nTaylor Gang will break the bank\nAin't got no time to contemplate\nI say i'm high from yesterday\nOkay i woke up on the mud\nI think i ate a 8th of shrums\nKeep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)\nYour hoe will come with us(ay)\nCause she know we brought the drugs(ay)\nAnd she looking for some love(ay)\nBut let's keep that on the hush(whoa)\nIt's hard to find some trust\nSome say it's hard to fuck with us\nThat's cause we be on different shit\nBitch i might pour six up in my Crush\nOhh that's super super much\nAnd this joint is super clutch\nGot 5 more just for you to stuff\nSend parents to the store for ice and cups\nI swear they never frighten us\nHell yeah we always lighting up\nPut that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch\nAnd i pour another 8th to level up\nProbably rolling up\n\n[Hook]\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWoke up drunk as fuck\nStill high from yesterday\nI'm trying to make a play\nI'm trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWho trying to make a play\nWoke up drunk as fuck\nStill high from yesterday\nI'm trying to make a play\nI'm trying to make a play", "image": "https://images.genius.com/329866c1bd0be13efe2300615c0293e5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Wiz Khalifa"}
