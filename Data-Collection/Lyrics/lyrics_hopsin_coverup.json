Is that what you need?\nWant me to pound your fucking ass till you bleed\nThe blast a few seeds, up in your coochie\nCome on, you can\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter\nAnd bitches wonder why I rap like a cruel nigga\nI need a woman who\u2019s amazing that can do right\nUntil then I guess that ill be gazing at the moonlight\n\n[Hook]\nAnd there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)\nIf I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon\u2019 be murdered (murdered)\nDo you wanna die tonight?
