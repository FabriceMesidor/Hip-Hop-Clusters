It always seems to trouble me\nNow all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me\nAnd you making it seem that it happened that way because of me\nBut I was curious\nAnd I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience\nYou could've been the one but it wasn't that serious\nThere was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it\nThat felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though\nYou never see it coming, you just get to see it go\nYeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first\nNow I can see it in her eyes, fireworks\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nOh, today it begins\nI've missed them before\nBut won't miss them again\nI keep having the same dream\nAnd I think that I just realized what it means\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nTaking off like fireworks\nTaking off like\u2014Oh\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nEverything's the same but it feels different\nMy dad called me up knowing that I still listen\nAnd he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping\nIt's been years though, I just learn to deal with it\nFor real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport\nGot my mother in a place with some better decor\nShe searched the entire city, I let her explore\nAnd now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before\nHow many of our parents marriages lasted?\nI was only 5, I bet I barely reacted\nI'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic\nSearching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic\nLet's stay together 'til we're ghosts\nI want to witness love, I never seen it close\nYeah, but I guess I gotta find it first\nThat's why I'm really going off, fireworks\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nOh, today it begins\nI've missed them before\nBut won't miss them again\nI keep having the same dream\nAnd I think that I just realized what it means\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nTaking off like fireworks\nTaking off like\u2014Oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0994c69f0994bc6b307070ecb02d6cd.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
