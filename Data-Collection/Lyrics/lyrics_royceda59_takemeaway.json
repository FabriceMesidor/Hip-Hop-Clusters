Maybe\nBut you don't think about it though, 'til them wakes is replaced by daisies\n\n[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9\" & Ameriie]\nTake me away, from all the pressures of livin' today\nAnd save me, I feel so alone\nI don't wanna live, when you appear, take my soul\nJust go, I wanna come home\n(Take me away, from all the pressures of livin today)\n(And save me, I feel so alone)\n(I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul)\n(Just go, I wanna come home)\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\" & Ameriie]\n(Sometimes I wanna cry) Askin' myself why\nIs it when fake niggas collide real niggas divide, but\n(It should be the other way) Dawg, I feel you\nDon't let 'em get to you, I love you, and you know who you are\n(And until we meet again) I just hope you choose your soldiers wisely\nCause likely the truth'll come out in the end and\n(And when it's that, time) We break bread, reflect back\nChill with the Lord and wait for the next batch\n(Of more hungry MCs) The new breed's climbin these trees\nSignin' these deeds, y'all remind me of me, hah\n(Cause this is your life) The soul is sellin'\nYour whole intelligent mode is exposed to the Devil\n(And when you lookin' back!) You never get your look back\nFlow or hook back, it's over, yo he took that, but\n(But he can take me) I'm right there\nThought I was chasin' a dream, shit I was chasin' a nightmare\n\n[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9\" & Ameriie]\nTake me away, from all the pressures of livin' today\nAnd save me, I feel so alone\nI don't wanna live, when you appear, take my soul\nJust go, I wanna come home\n(Take me away, from all the pressures of livin today)\n(And save me, I feel so alone)\n(I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul)\n(Just go, I wanna come home)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d86b45b993cdf0c53559e740521a4bba.500x494x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
