you\nHuh\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nFlowers on my grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)\nRats in the sewer dance when I die (When I die)\nChampagne in the shower, toast when I cry (When I cry)\nI was born to kill, livin' is a crime (Is a crime)\nNikes in the box until the money fill it (Money fill it)\nSki mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it (Make me peel it)\nYayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush (Need a rush)\nHead all in your system, pussies need a flush (Need a flush)\n\n[Verse 1: Rick Ross]\nChoppers on the seat as I listen to Meek\nSpeakin' less to niggas as bodies increase\nSee me on your set, better check your circumference\nMight end up on your back and not bein' responsive\nI was forced to kill 'cause I want to live\nAnd if you wanna buy a crib, they give you thirty years (Thirty years)\nMe against the world, pistol in your clutch (In your clutch)\nThey like to call it freedom, it was never such (It was never such)\nNiggas on the porch, weed in the blunts (In the blunts)\nYou go against the team, you ain't seen in months (Seen in months)\nBitch nigga died, bitch niggas die (Niggas die)\nFlowers on his grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)\nPocket full of money and I need the most\nI tell 'bout what you are, you niggas' needle's low (Needle's low)\nBitches know you broke just lookin' at your hoes (At your hoes)\nThey need some newer purses than they shit they post (Shit they post)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rick Ross]\nKilo in the mornin', skip the cappuccino (Cappuccino)\nBomb under my car like I was Al Pacino (Al Pacino)\nFlowers for a king, flowers for a king (For a king)\nSo, the very day I die, this song you sing (Song you sing)\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nFlowers on my grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)\nRats in the sewer dance when I die (When I die)\nChampagne in the shower, toast when I cry (When I cry)\nI was born to kill, livin' is a crime (Is a crime)\nNikes in the box until the money fill it (Money fill it)\nSki mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it (Make me peel it)\nYayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush (Need a rush)\nHead all in your system, pussies need a flush (Need a flush)\n\n[Interlude: Jeezy]\nLet's go, Snow\n\n[Verse 2: Jeezy]\nI ain't playin' wit' 'em, no way, no how (No how)\nGot the .40 in my 'Didas sweats right now (Boom)\nI'm knockin' everything down, bowl three strikes\nHad to count up all the paper, took me three nights\nPray the Lord protect my soul, I'm just tryna make it (Make it)\nHad to leave them niggas 'lone, they was thinkin' basic (Yeah)\nSo many hundreds in my pocket like some Hammer pants (Hammer pants)\nShit be funny 'til you ridin' in that ambulance (Woo)\nSay my name three times, I'm the Candy Man (Snow)\nSo many verts outside, call it Candy Land (Dope)\nPussy nigga turned to owls, they like, \"Who nigga?\" (Who nigga?)\nBrought them bananas for the monkeys at the zoo, nigga (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross & Jeezy]\nFlowers on my grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)\nRats in the sewer dance when I die (When I die)\nChampagne in the shower, toast when I cry (When I cry)\nI was born to kill, livin' is a crime (Is a crime, Snow)\nNikes in the box until the money fill it (Money fill it)\nSki mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it (Make me peel it)\nYayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush (Need a rush)\nHead all in your system, pussies need a flush (Need a flush)\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nPowers of position I'm addicted to\nThat's what sweepin' up the block just for a nickel do\nI put down nickel rocks just in the nick of time\nNow that S500 Benz just circle fifty times\nHundred shots, don't make me put that .50 down *gunshot*\nWhen that bitch go off, I bet it make a nigga proud\nWalk up on you and he make a piggy sound\nThen I'm back to the strip club to blow a bitch allowance\nWe know them niggas tellin' but we hustle harder (Hustle harder)\nI was born to kill, I pray I die a martyr (Die a martyr)\nYou should die today but I'ma try tomorrow (Try tomorrow)\nI always end a threat that's followed by the flowers\nI just got a phone call, that boy Bo Diddley home\nI bet in thirty days that boy be fifty strong\nRace to get a million just the way we think\nMiddle of the summer in a cheetah mink (Cheetah mink)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Rick Ross]\nKilo in the mornin', skip the cappuccino (Cappuccino)\nBomb under my car like I was Al Pacino (Al Pacino)\nFlowers for a king, flowers for a king (For a king)\nSo, the very day I die, this song you sing (Song you sing)\n\n[Chorus: Rick Ross]\nFlowers on my grave, doves in the sky (Doves in the sky)\nRats in the sewer dance when I die (When I die)\nChampagne in the shower, toast when I cry (When I cry)\nI was born to kill, livin' is a crime (Is a crime)\nNikes in the box until the money fill it (Money fill it)\nSki mask in my pocket so don't make me peel it (Make me peel it)\nYayo in my blood, it's like I need a rush (Need a rush)\nHead all in your system, pussies need a flush (Need a flush)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e962334e64ea4f814fb520d8bae77334.742x742x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rick Ross"}
