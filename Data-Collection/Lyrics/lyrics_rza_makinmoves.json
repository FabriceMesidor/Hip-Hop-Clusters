Let a brother know\nSee you could plant a seed, water it and watch it grow\nI'm just tryna go places I ain't never been before\nHe's so calm, he's so chill\nThe flow so mean but he nice for real\nI'm just running to my momma just to pay those bills\nAnd the team gotta eat so we all need meals\nMy cup runneth over and they want that spill\nI always saw the plan before I saw that deal\nStay focused and soon they'll notice\nThe case still closed but this letter was open, we rolling\n\n[Hook]\nNo matter how the wind blows\nWe gotta keep a cold flow\nDouble O's to the [?]\nCause we be making that big dough\nYou gotta keep a cold flow\nAny way the wind blows\nWe be dropping that info\nAnd we be making that big dough\nWe be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh\nYou gotta keep a cold flow\nAny way the wind blows\nWe be dropping that info\nAnd we be making that big dough\nWe be making that big dough oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n[Scratch Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4da2c8eb203b05289598495cc97e5df.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "RZA"}
