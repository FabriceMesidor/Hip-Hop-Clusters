Pain reliever? Fever inducer?\nAnd held a chocolate Thai Buddha, now I'm looser\nI fantasize about this crew I took last week\nAnd yo, that's me at the sympathy, to pass me\nBut I was brought to reality, a rude awakening\nMy man just got taken, it's mad time he's facing\nJetted upstairs, got a call from my cousin\nBack in Brooklyn, only fifteen the kid is bugging\nTold me about the spot that he hit that had a drop on the spot\nBut his man almost got shot\nNow it's the talk of the block cause he's dead and in the cab\nThe Troy Ave laughed, then he started tumble (?)\nCounted the cash, but one nigga tried to stash\nWho wet the quills? niggas was up in his ass\nAs he kicked it, by the little story that he told\nI was fickled in his hold, then off the old gold\nTill I got to be on the other line, put him on hold\nIt was my shorty, told her call me back, kid you're too old\nIt was a quarter to one, Friday night\nLoaded up my guns to blow the horns, called up my son\nSon, you come through I got a proposition for you\nKeep it on the low so the plan won't spoil\nMy crew's loyal, they came over in a minute\nTo kick it 'bout this nigga, who think he getting bigger\nPumping on our side, don't even know him from a hole\nIn the wall, tonight's going to be his downfall\nSo fuck him and everything he stand for\nAbout this time, he be on the corner\nSlinging with a crackhead, kept me bringing\nSales to the building, a bunch of bitches fiending\nI figure we could get the goods, kill the nigga\nAnd be it that we live right next to the river\nWe can catch him off guard, throw him in the water\nBefore the coastguards come on God this shit ain't hard\nBut think, the one you give a couple up's your fate\nAnd keep your eyes open for the jakes, the snakes and the snitches\nThe ones you see, the nigga with the riches\nActing like a little bunch of bitches\nPointing me out in pictures\nThe Five-O's like \"you know who is this\"\nIt's Havoc, you better recognise it, realise\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Twin Gambino]\nIn morn' store, for y'all niggas who once swore\nSure to trigger press, to lick you in the jaw\nRaw, bullet holes, all in your clothes\nYour Volv's, now you lay with your eyes closed\nIn a casket you bastard, you went too fast kid\nShouting why I motherfucking blasted\nHectic, I can't believe the shit beneath my eyes\nI cannot think straight, or I might get hypnotised\nI don't stress shit, cause I'm out to get mines\nSo when you step to me, you will be surprised\nThe type of shit I kick is so you're leaking in the skies\nSo when you say the Mobb Deep time is a lie\nYou'll be swimming in a puddle of Death, and that's no threat\nHectic, hectic, hectic, hectic\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nWhen things get real, it ain't what you expected\nMe and my peoples is known to get hectic\nOnly to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions\nMake them see the light when my shots make connections\nNiggas get they face split in sections\nShook using ice grill looks for they protection\nWe absorb everything you fear\nAnd indulge in a crime-filled atmosphere\nThis shit ain't nothing new, it's only things that we used to\nWe used to stick niggas on the F through to the E train\nWhen it's time to recruit, I humble on the D train\nSee my man D only to purchase my dope thang\nWord to my unborn seed\nA nigga got to make loot to support greed\nOn the wild side of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion\nIt's so cold you might get frozen\nIf you leave yourself vulnerable, in time lapsing\nFools collapsing, and caught up in gun clapping\nDon't matter who you are, if you know many faces\nI don't discriminate, my shots bleed all races\nAnd cultures, we sort of like vultures\nEating your insides like ulcers\nAnd pause niggas pulses, like\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d36f3c5fdf16cb402e39bef763e25bf4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
