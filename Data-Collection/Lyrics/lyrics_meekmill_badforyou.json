This your life\nWord up\n\n[Hook: Nicki Minaj]\nYou bring out feelings in me I never show\nNobody has made me feel this way before\nI'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad-ad-ad\nI wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nWe just fucking up the city, going hard every night\nNiggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right\nCause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right\nBut you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight\nSo they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect\nI'm loving your style the way you preserve it\nJust look at my eyes and see what's inside\nYou know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it\nBut said I ain't ready, really I'm ready\nReally I'm ready, I'm ready like never before\nI'mma just give you a key to my heart\nYou'll be the first that I let in the door\nI used to hear that you flirt with them guys\nThey never would score\nAll you was hearing about me and the women\nAin't trust them before\nYou know what you're doing, fuck what they said\nYou know what we on\nWhen we in bed, it's like we on stage\nAnd I got the mic so let me perform, sing it\n\n[Hook: Nicki Minaj]\nYou bring out feelings in me I never show\nNobody has made me feel this way before\nI'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad-ad-ad\nI wanna be bad for you\nI wanna be bad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a5cda77113ea2b18bfbec0f3ffbaf69.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Meek Mill"}
