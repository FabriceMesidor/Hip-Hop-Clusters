Lord don't you ever stop..\nFill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..\n\n[KRS-One]\nLook, look!\nBa-bi-di-ba-bi-dang-a-dang-diggy\nHow many rappers can actually hang with me?\nMy style is that Kris-style, it's witty\nIn they style, I have no more Faith like Biggie\nI battle on many levels, I shatter so many devils\n'Fore you challenge me you better know the essentials\nIt's the K to the R to the S, to the uno\nYou know, if you don't know your crew know\nWhen you hear the thunderin sound, you under the ground\nYou can tell by the way we jumpin around\nIt's the teacher, breakin it down\nI'm an upright MC, these others they be crawlin around, word\n\n[Repeat 2X - *sung*]\nLord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..\nFill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..\n\n[KRS-One]\nYeah yeah, word up, look, look!\nYou know when the teacher returns, just get ready to learn\nJust get ready to earn, health, love\nAwareness and money to burn, I'm not really concerned\nHow the Benz just turn, 'round the corner\nFor our sons and daughters to yearn, stand firm\nIf you lookin at these hooks you becomin a mad worm\nDanglin from the pole of the fisher, the corporate fisher\nThe talent scout and no doubt ready to get ya!\n\n[Repeat 1X - *sung*]\nLord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..\nFill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..\n\n[KRS-One]\nLook look look look!\nI'm anything BUT regular, not even similar\nI get rid of the SIN in ya when I spit at ya, my new literature\nNow who forever been with ya? THE TEACHER!\nWho remembers the kid in ya? THE TEACHER!\nI'm winnin ya, or winnin a convert when the rhyme splurt at the concert\nForget the times that hurt, if the mind's alert let the mind work\nUh! Let the body divert\nTo get to the top of the mountain, you've got to climb dirt\nSo c'mon climb through, don't get stuck lookin behind you\nIt'll blind you, however I'm here to remind you\nMany of you lost you've got to find you\nYou'll be found you simply by you finding you, c'mon!\n\n[Repeat 4X - *sung*]\nLord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..\nFill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d84f73e1b21b8b4dbd679efa191364e4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
