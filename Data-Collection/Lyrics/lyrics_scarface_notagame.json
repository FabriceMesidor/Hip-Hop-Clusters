Dawg, probably not\nLaid back reminiscin on the times I shot\nDare all motherfuckers trippin in them parkin lots\nIf it was war niggas wanted it was war they got\nI'm a nigga, a real nigga, a quick thanker\nThat would hesitate to aim and see the chamber\nDischarge the cartridges that the hollow-point came from\nYou can hide but you cain't run\nYeah, and he just started what can not be stopped\nAnd fucked up cause you were thinkin you could not be got\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nThis is not a game\nNiggas want a lifestyle with finer thangs\nHustlin to come up on these diamond chains, diamond rangs\nRunnin on the daily out here tryin to slang\n\n[Scarface]\nNow analyzin all the wrong I've done\nI'm surprised I ain't dead I guess the good die young\nI put a hole in a nigga head, fuck why run\nFrom a lazy motherfucker cause he flashed his gun\nWe ain't cut from the same shit, nigga I'm a shooter\nIf I show I got a pistol best believe I'mma shoot a\nStupid motherfucker down, shoot a motherfucker down\nChalk his ass in the dirt with a bullet in his mouth\nAnd I won't lose sleep cause when it come time for me to pay the piper\nFuck it, I've been tryin to meet\nYeah~! So please believe that when it's time to show\nI'll be ready with my arms crossed, dyin to go\nAnd I won't shed tears, I'm respected here\nAnd you won't hear things you'd expect to hear\nI rejected fear; and I don't wanna be another second here\nBut the question is, is he lettin me live?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Scarface]\nRight here the pros and cons\nCause life's way deeper than the frozen arm\nThey might streetsweep you if you're holdin on\nMy Sunday School teacher taught us Job in songs, another soul is gone\nShe couldn't have told me shit\nCause all I wanna do right here is fold me grip\nAnd she talks to me in codes and all I know is bricks\nLearn how to rock me up an O I coulda sold for six, instead she sold me tricks\nSo now I plead my case\nThe cops all on me tryin to bleed my safe\nMy pops all on me tryin to squeeze my face\nBut I'm not gon' squeal so I'mma need my space, back up I need my space\nMomma ain't raised no rat\nThe word got back and niggas paid for that\nYo' ass got served and never made it back\nYour ass had birds a nigga laid you flat, and then he raid your stack\nThat's how the game is played\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a83e0fa554b5f2e5c5acce61362bbe7.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
