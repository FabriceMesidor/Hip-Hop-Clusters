Blige, let 'em know this is not a test\nI hear you calling\n\n[Mary]\nWhat you hear is not a test\nI'm rocking to the beat (I'm rocking to the beat)\nSee me and my crew and my friends\nWe're gonna try to move your feet (move around, move around)\nSee I am Mary Blige (yes I am)\nAnd I'd like to say hello (thank you for inviting me)\nTo the black, to the white, the red and the brown\nThe purple and yellow (everybody)\nBut first you gotta, oh, but first you gotta", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e55efd63b221413fdd81cd115e5549ab.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Missy Elliott"}
