Fuck ya'll, check it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nTwis' got skill, yes I kill\nI get wild on they ass like Buffalo Bill\nI be winnin' in the game like them niggas in the south\nIf a nigga talkin' shit I'm quick to hit em in the mouth\nThem lyrics that's the shit I be equipped to spit 'em out\nAnd I'mma make a nigga sick cause I got venom in the mouth\nAntonyms and synonyms are spinnin' him out of his route\nAnd I got bricks of money, bitch and I can't fit em in the couch\nKill 'em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish\nKill 'em with syllables quick wit 8 bars in a sequence\nI am the bid'ness I gotta charge you to peep this\nNiggas can't see me I'm Ray Charles or a eclipse\nStevie in the blackout see me with the Mack out\nTwista gon' get money like a GD in a crack house\nWhen it come to flows I'mma spit 'em like they cold\nWhen it come to niggas heads I'mma split it like a pole\nTake away they swag and shit on they cocky style\nCuz my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao\n[?] come solo wit my k-olo\nWhen you see my logo come take my photo when I'm on promo\nNiggas wanna get me they better pick a new regimen\nShit too sick B somebody better go get you medicine\nNot bringin' up Twista I'm makin' the issue relevant\nBalls bigger than mine better go get two elephants\nI be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant\nBeat yo face up till yo jaw tissue look like a pelican\nI be steady whoopin' yo ass just fo' the hell of it\nCan't nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate\nI kick a hot flow, get it like Harpo\nBrief when I rhyme teeth shine like a car show\nWit a thick bitch, go 'head check out my cargo\nYou know one gon' be wit me wherever my car go\nWhere yo baby at, where yo white Mercedes at?\nI'll let u borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back\nHere, a couple stacks, you ain't gotta pay me back\nMe and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at\nWhether we comin' and killin' and murderin' cause I beat down the block\nOr because I'm like \"throw ya hands up\" cause it's hip hop\nI'd rather be rappin' about the streets and makin' a quick pot\nBut it's time to do something so the shorties don't get popped\nMeanwhile back to the lab I got the desert eagle\nCome on yo muthafuckin tip and kill eleven people\nThrow up on a priest let him know I ain't no reverend\nEither dat I go where the fuck I want I'm up in heaven evil\nYou ain't gotta tell me I know I spit bars sick\nE-mail, anthrax, flows kick arsenic\nG-up genie and throw it up I'm car sick\nCut raw dope deez nigga cut garbage\nLethargic give a bitch hard dick\nSee my niggas and I say \"salute\" like a sergeant\nCan't lie I'm one of the coldest artists\nSo I wouldn't have yo bitch up in my apartment\nSo I be passin' out \"fuck you\" flyers\nTo fakers and heaters and then fuck liars\nIf yo' shit ain't one been one minded\nThe swine flu H1N1 virus\nAm I like Jason? No I'm more like Michael Myers\nI am the shit I need to wear diapers\nWhen I spit it sometimes I'm all too philosophical\nBlame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical\nTwista got more swag than a rich sissy\nBut don't get prissy muthafuckas can get grilly\nI'mma balla and a boss and yes I'm finna get paid\nTakin' flames to the head like I'm Nicolas Cage\nI ghost ride the whip I'm finna get laid\nAny niggas dat try to get me is finna get sprayed\nOne day it's possible dat I'm finna get saved\nBut for now I be getting money I'm finna get made, muthafucka\nFucka.. ..fucka.. .. fucka.. ..fucka", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b1b74202bc3fa82e3dcce1439a67e984.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
