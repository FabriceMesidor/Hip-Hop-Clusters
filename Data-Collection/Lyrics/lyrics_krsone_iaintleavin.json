Sweaty yet ready reaching higher for more\nMy purpose is to inspire the poor\nSo I fire it raw, the others be out for fame\nYet Knowledge Reigns Supreme, that's a household name\n(They is hot!) I doubt they gain\nI'm true school like Kurtis, I'll blow out they flame (and they know it!)\nThey may say the crown, they can hold it\nBut when I'm in the spot, they dare not show it\nCause they're not poets, exactly that\nAll they rap for is lust and them platinum plaques\nKRS comes after that\nThis that masterful emcee, I'm from a blast masterful cat\nHolding a class in the back\nIt's obviously I mastered rap, I'm blasting 'em back\n\n[Hook: Triune]\nI live for the love of the game\nI spit, I reign through the struggle and pain\nNineteen years strong been touching their brains\nI ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'\n\n[Verse 2: KRS-One]\nMy whole life is different, high school I skipped it\nRight around fifteen I knew that I was gifted\nSelf-taught home school specific\nSimplistic, my characteristic holistic, a mystic\nEverything to me is encrypted\nImbued with the same wind energy that be flowing from my spirit\nThose that have ears to hear, hear it\nThere's no excuse if there's a free library and you don't go near it\nMe I seek the truth, others they fear it\nThey living in the mansions, I'm living in the spirit\nThat negativity, I will clear it\nThat productivity, I will share it with all who will hear it\nYou see now that I exist and can never be told\nThat hip-hop was about silver and gold\nWith the mic I hold or held\nI try to elevate beyond whatever soul or cell\nYo I sound odd but you know about that camel\nThat needle the rich man in the kingdom of God\nBring the real, many bring the fa\u00e7ade\nThem bells in your head, yeah I'm ringing them hard\n\n[Hook: Triune]\nI live for the love of the game\nI spit, I reign through the struggle and pain\nNineteen years strong been touching their brains\nI ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'\n\n[Verse 3: Propaganda]\nOperation defacement, face it\nPerfect word placement chase it, wait\nCatch one incident of intimate images and word\nGet comfortable, a ton of bull is held at bay\nKeep your ear to the street, peep footsoldier and I told you\nWhen mixtape hit the street, it's curb and concrete\nBeat beast, heat feast, don't speak, hold heat\nHoly though he better let it\nBetter get it offer I'm taking position\nYoung listen\nNice as five high-speed chase to ditch cases\nCali give it three strikes, I might give you four\nBars to get it right, I check the mic in the floor\nYou ain't bold enough to hold enough\nFlow ain't cold enough\nFool I sho nuff showed up to blow that show up\nShoulderin' a brain quicker than DSL modems\nWhen I touch down, I raid your town\n\n[Hook: Triune]\nI live for the love of the game\nI spit, I reign through the struggle and pain\nNineteen years strong been touching their brains\nI ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/12162bd5dc20dab4c0cbb67190522d80.500x493x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
