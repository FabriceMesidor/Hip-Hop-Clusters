(3x)\n\n[Hook: Bilal]\nOhhh...\nEverything's gone be alright\nIf you play your cards right\nEverything's gone be alright...\n\n[Verse 1: Common]\nIt's do or die, your looking through the eye of a revolver\nI revolve around the world, a problem solver\nAlter your ego, and the way your walkin'\nTalk to people, still I stay regal\nRead through the bullshit\nSometime to make peace, you need a full clip\nRoll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price\nTalk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right\nIt's the good life, like T.I. said\nGettin' it, how could I not be fed\nGet bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'\nIn the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low\nLet problems burn slow away\nI yearn for the day that it won't go gray\nRemember we were kings, back in the day\nStill can be, depending on the cards you play\n\n[Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)]\nIf you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)\nEverything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nI ain't playin' with a full deck\nThe government won't let me get a full check\nI'm taxin' marks, I got more heart than clubs\nThe black spade, givin' 'em darker love\nMake 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face\nYou tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes\nIt's high like the ace is\nGet your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift\nYou get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds\nLeave you nickle-less, like Jack in \"Shining\"\nBlocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen\nTook your chips, let my guys in Texas Hold 'Em\nRolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players\nStacey Adams of different flavors, we major\nGangstas and hustles, living moviestar life\nDealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right\n\n[Hook 1: Bilal (repeat 2x)]\nIf you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)\nEverything... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))\n\n[Hook 2: Bilal (repeat 2x)]\nOhh...\nIf you play (if you play), your cards right (cards right)\nEverything's... gone be alright (well... alright (3x))\n\n[Accapella: Bilal]\nYeah... Ohhh...\n\nEverything's gone be alright, if you play your cards right\nEverything's gone be alright...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da89ed2094b9a8d542d03ed39ea208e1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
