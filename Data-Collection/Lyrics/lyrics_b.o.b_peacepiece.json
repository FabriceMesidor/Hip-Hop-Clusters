I ain't sure\nBut for now I'm like Malcolm out the window, it's simple altercation\nGot these motherfuckers blazin'\nAnd I ain't tryna say bye to my kinfolk\nThey choke us out like what they need a noose for?\nGentrify like fuck wherever you go\nPrison walls nowadays big biz\nGive us dope then lock us up to get riches\nThen send us out to a job we can't get\nYou had that nigga flipped now you back in the system\nThat's a cold game, man, aww dog\nIf there's a God pray she listenin'\nThe president don't give a fuck about us\nThe government don't give a fuck either\nThey talkin' make America great again\nI just wanna save my people\nI just want that 40 acres and a mule\nAnother promise didn't fall through\nJust a whole lot of propaganda and lyin' to me and you\nI tried to take the high road\n\n[Chorus]\nI tried to take the high road\nLet bygones be bygones\nI tried to take the high road\nBut now another life's gone\nWhat you expect from me?\nTo turn the other cheek?\nAll you bring is war, asking me for peace\nWhat you expect from me, when all you bring is greed\nAll you bring is war, asking me for peace\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nBut now I gotta piece piece piece\nYeah, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8503048adb15531893faed024074601e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
