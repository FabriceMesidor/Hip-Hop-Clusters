I ever could've told them bitches\nCorduroys and Cartiers\nBack then, motherfuckers never shared my vision\nBut what you riding in, a space ship?\nAnd where your diamonds from, Saudi Arabia?\nOh, you done came up and put your niggas on?\nNow you got a crown and a chinchilla on\nA1 since day one\nWe stayed down so we came up\nSome of them niggas won't make it with you\nThey'll lose hope and they'll change up\nI can see these niggas hating\nBut as you can see, the bad bitches love it\nThey ain't let us in the VIP back then\nNow our names on the flyer if we coming\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]\nI tried to tell them I was gonna be something\nThey used to look at me and laugh\nAll them hoes in the city don't really love you unless you got some cash\nThat's brand new paint, nigga, don't smudge it\nMu'fuckin pants cost eight somethin'\nThat's my money so they can't say nothin'\nThat's my money so they won't say nothin'\n\n[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]\nUsed to have to eat cold meals

ass unannounced in a foreign, I don't know where I'm going\nHit the gas, can I hear the engine running (nope)\nLiving fast, I ain't thinking about tomorrow (nope)\nUsed to be a nigga want 20-inch rims\nNow we got accountants out here for Rae Sremm\nAll in the mall, Neiman Marcus shopping\nCame a long way from them Ida Street apartments\nEverybody got a dream that they chasin'\nAnd everybody got a motherfucking hater\nThey wanna see your dreams burn to ashes\nI can't wait to see their faces when I pass them (skrrr)\nBoy, you should taken a young nigga serious\nNow a young nigga's on for real\nThey wasn't fucking with a young nigga then\nThey can't fuck with a young nigga still\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Slim Jxmmi]\nI used to tell them I was gonna be something\nThey used to look at me and laugh\nAll them hoes in the city don't really love you until you countin' cash\nThat's brand new paint, nigga no smudges\nMy mu'fuckin pants cost eight hunnid\nThat's my money, bitch, you can't say

slowing it down just to ask for a photo\nJust know that I'm fuckin', not maybe, for sure though\nSoldiers on me like I'm fresh out the dojo\nShe think I'm beautiful, chocolate skin, cocoa\nDon't get it fucked up, put your ass in a chokehold\nPlayers only live once so I wear Polo\nPolo, Polo, Polo, Polo\nMy girl is from SoCal, my outfit from SoHo\nAnd I got dough, that shit is stashed in the crib\nAnd it won't leave the house like it's fucking DiGiorno\nHell yeah, nigga, that's all me\nI'm from where big problems get handled with a small fee\nStarted with the squad, now I got the whole team tight\nStuck to the plot, stuck to the script, and I don't even screenwrite\n\n[Chorus: Slim Jxmmi & Swae Lee]\nUsed to have to eat cold meals (yeah)\nNow a nigga offin' gold seals (hey)\nCountin' up money, gettin' chills (yeah)\nWe some young niggas on for real\nTokyo drift through the hills (skrr)\nUsed to have to walk, no wheels (rr)\nNow I'm buyin' whips for the crib
