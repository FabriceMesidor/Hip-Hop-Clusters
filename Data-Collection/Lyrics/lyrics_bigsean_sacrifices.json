trust you, I'm gon' shoot you\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nI done made sacrifices (I, I)\nSo many sacrifices (straight, straight up)\nI done gave up so much free time knowing time ain\u2019t free\nFuck it, I sacrificed it\nMy girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)\nAnd if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)\nTo get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices\nFuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Big Sean]\nFuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy\nI got telepathy, I got the recipe\nI got the streets and I don\u2019t got no felonies\nForward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me\nMomma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be\nIt's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me\nIt's some niggas that I just met in debt to me\nWhat's in common is they both pay respect to me\nI get it my way from Friday to Friday\nMy girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade\nI came a long way from that \"Marvin and Chardonnay\"\nI pull out the driveway like I\u2019m in a car chase speeding!\nAnd if my bitch cheat she know I\u2019m leaving!\nNo text, no call boy\nThat bitch airplane mode, cold\nNo peacoat, no time to change clothes\nSame clothes, love if you living by the same code\nG-code, leave ho\nFuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny\nPenthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me\nI got my self out of debt\nSo when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nI done made sacrifices (I, I)\nSo many sacrifices (straight, straight up)\nI done gave up so much free time knowing time ain\u2019t free\nFuck it, I sacrificed it\nMy girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)\nAnd if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)\nTo get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices\nFuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge: Big Sean]\nI cut the fuck shit drama out my energy\nFocused on the inner me, never on the enemy\nAnd I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind\nI done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life\nLook, I cut the fuck shit drama out my energy\nFocused on the inner me, never on the enemy\nAnd I done sacrificed my own time, I done sacrificed my own mind\nI done sacrificed the club life, I done sacrificed my love life\n\n[Verse 2: Offset]\nOffset!\nI done sacrificed the thug life, diamonds shining ain't no dull life\nDrop my top to get my mind right, pull up in the 'Rari, loud pipes\nBitch, I'm the don, my wrist a hundon (Patek)\nOoh, yeah, Gucci python\nOoh, yeah, she play with her tongue\nYeah, I bought that bitch a new charm\nLit nigga pop one\nI told her come see about me (come on, come see me)\nThe devil had entered my soul\nMy momma had beat it out me (the devil, my momma)\nRemember my grandmama had told me you better be somebody\nHop in my seats massaging (ayy)\nWatch how I lead the posse, I made an M deposit\n\n[Verse 3: Quavo]\nPaid all these dues with the game (yeah yeah)\nSacrificed yo stripes for that stain (sacrifice)\nHeard you sacrificed your life for that chain (yeah yeah)\nShe sacrificed that money for cocaine (white, phew, coco)\nLeft hand got three rings, that's Bron Bron, we up one\nBad bitch she a savage, take her to the mall and buy her something\nThat's gonna wanna make your friends come\nMake way with the tommy gun\nWhy can't y'all recognize\nThat we all came from sacrifice?\nWhy can't y'all recognize\nThat we all came from sacrifice?\nTen toes, yeah, you gotta stay down, ayy\nJust some young niggas looking for a way out, ayy\nPeople watchin', yeah, I gotta skip town, ayy\nHit my phone if you need a whole pound, ayy\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nI done made sacrifices (I, I)\nSo many sacrifices (straight, straight up)\nI done gave up so much free time knowing time ain\u2019t free\nFuck it, I sacrificed it\nMy girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices (I, I)\nAnd if it's real real love then you make sacrifices (straight up)\nTo get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices\nFuck it though, that's how hungry my appetite is, yeah, yeah\n\n[Outro: Big Sean & Quavo]\nI know my great, great, great aunty was a slave\nI could only imagine all the sacrifice she made\nI could only imagine all the shit she had to take\nI'ma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain\nI sacrificed for your entertainment boy\nI'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix\nCheck the last name it's all facts\nAnd the human race is all about pacing\nLook at all the ones I outlasted\nI'm the one at the end like I count backwards\nNever satisfied, details classified\n'Til the afterlife, make a sacrifice, Don\nWhy can\u2019t y\u2019all recognize\nThat we all came from sacrifice?\nWhy can\u2019t y\u2019all recognize\nThat we all came from sacrifice?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15fe74f551404783e7b7cb1a8ba102e9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
