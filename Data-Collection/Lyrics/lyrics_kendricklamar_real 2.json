Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real\nI'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)\n\n[Skit: Kenny Duckworth and Paula Duckworth]\nAlright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom\nBoy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do\n\n[Bridge: Anna Wise]\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\n\n[Skit: Paula Duckworth]\n\"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.\"\n\n(*Sound of a cassette tape being stopped and fast forwarded*)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f3db37bb8953d6e671d8bb532da2e855.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
