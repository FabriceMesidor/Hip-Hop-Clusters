Its high school\nAnd everybodys tryin to earn a rep\nAnd he gone gun shot a homie to death\nThe impossible is happenin\nChildren are left to make decisions\nDo ya let 'em die or kill them urself?\n\n[Hook: Shateish]\nAs I look at my life..\nRemembering where ive been\nI may not have been here\nCuda been in the gutter\nDrowning in my tears\nI remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)\nEverytime you turn around somebody got shot..\nOooooh\nBut I'm still here\nI'm still here\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAnother homie got murdered in the dope house\nAss pocket full of money\nChillin' gettin' smoked out\nTwo shots hit him in his face when he blast it\nFrame pictured\nAnd its closed casket\nThis is so tragic\nI see death on every block I turn\nIts just not my turn\nLive the same lifestyle\nCash money to burn\nWeed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term\nWhen it feels like real life\nKnowin' is next\nRep to take it\nBe the last left\nHumble yourself\nIn slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'\nThat second from the beginning\nBack to the end and that lesson\nIs nothin short of what a nigga expect\nLivin' life like this\nThis is duly respect\nAnd I refuse to give debt\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nYeah I remember\nWe tatted are names on our arms for fun\nWritin rest in piece for the dead and gone\nThats just me\nAnd I ain't the one to stunt\nBut seems like im losing somebody every other month\nThats why I walk through the hood\nTryin' talk to the hood\nBut some niggas is lost in the hood\nAnd we blind to that fact\nThat we actin' like they wanted us to act\nWhite man versus black\nReason why I ain't vote for Barack is cause I love him\nThey gonna want him hanged after that\nIn god we trust\nWhat? (what?)\nMoney or the life of a soldier\nSent to die in the war in a fight\nThat never should took place\nAmeri-K-K-K\nUsed to be a great place (great place)\nNow I guess we save face (save face)\nJohn McCain hates niggas, (hates niggas)\nOn Martin Lutha King day. (hahahahaha)\nGo Figure\n\n[Hook:]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6976a10236f881255b574212a02ae481.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
