Am I a shocka', shocka'?\nAm I a robba', robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma\nAm I a robba', robba'? Am I a shocka', shocka'?\nAm I a robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma, i'ma hang the phone up\nCause you know what? I see the future\nIt may look good now but jail ain't what I'm used to\nThe soul says give not take without giving\nIf that's the real you, then that's how you should start living\nBut we frontin', frontin'\nStill huntin', huntin' for somethin', somethin'\nBut all this huntin', stuntin' droke cluckin' is leavin' at nothing\nStart dustin', reach on the shelf and dust your soul off\nYou put it there, gettin' your goal off\n\n[Hook] x2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8219c6b423edb4d95b5c842a51f3b31e.640x480x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
