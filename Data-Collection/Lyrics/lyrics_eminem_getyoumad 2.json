Study these five chapters\nLesson 1, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers\nLesson 2, face 'em and diss 'em (What up, dawg?)\nDon't give 'em a demo, kidnap 'em\n(Come on, you're comin' with me, motherfucker, check this out)\nAnd make 'em come to your basement and listen\nLesson 3, get a job at a label\nSwitch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table\n(Here, listen)\nLesson 4, know you heard this before\n\"Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow for sure\"\nDon't act like a fan, you wanna get signed\nGet the whitest A&R you can find\nPull him aside and rap as wack as you can (Hey dude, come here)\nLesson 5, get a hook-up at Jive\nDress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live\nAnd that's the key, but when you see me on the street\nI ain't givin' you shit, bitch, don't even bother askin' me\nToilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'\n'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin', like Master P (Ungh)\nGot a blowjob from Paula Jones and stuffed it so far in her mouth\nMy balls broke both of her collarbones\nTold Mya this shit was all about me-ah\nGave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea\nAnd all three of my main girls said, \"See ya\"\n'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in\nAnd caught me fuckin' Aaliyah\nI splish-splash while I'm takin' a bath\nGrab a handful of pills, break 'em in half, take 'em and laugh\nWhite trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass\nWhile you're out siphonin' gas\nFor your lawn mower to cut the grass\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSo if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad\n(Yo, why you diss me?)\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nAnd when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had\n(A big dick)\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nI can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nHe'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad (Nurse, nurse)\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWhat a wonderful day, I should go outside and play\nAin't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate\nHi, Ren\u00e9e (Oh, hi)\nI was just about to toss a live grenade\nIn your driveway and drive away (What?)\nAre you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS?\nBlood drippin' from it\nRippin' your stomach like a paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9\nYou talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill, though\nI'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow\nTipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh\nJumped up, choked a giraffe\nSnapped his neck and broke it in half\nWagin' wars, went on stage\nAnd sprayed Cage with Agent Orange\nAnd wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here)\nThe demon is here, I'm steamin' this year\nI rip ********* voice box out and scream in his ear\nIt's not a gimmick, bitch, it's an image, I live it\nGive a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it\n\"Yeah, I don't think this guy is well\"\nI'm high as hell, I'll beat you with a live cat\nWhen I'm swingin' him by his tail\nI'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', lay your nuts on the dresser\nJust your nutsack by itself\nAnd bang them shits with a spiked bat\nCut your neck off, then sew your head right back\nAnd leave you like that\nYou just triggered a prick who just mixed liquor\nWho's itchin' to leave you disfigured\nAnd stiffer than Christopher Reeves\nI was dealing with strep throat\nWhile your mother was breastfeeding\nAnd gave her the flesh-eating disease\nI'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees\nAnd walkin' through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans\n(Am I a Blood or a Crip?)\nWakin' up the next day in breathing machines\nFlashin' back to bein' shot and repeating the scenes\nOn how you just got smoked, and if you do live\nYou'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and Pac joke\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nSo if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nAnd when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nI can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\nHe'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad\nYou know I just be sayin' that to get you mad\n\n[Outro: Eminem & Sway]\nI know that makes you real mad, don't it? (Uh-huh)\nThat's right, Slim Shady (Yup)\nSway and Tech, sprayin' wreck (Bitch)\nAnd we don't give a heck (Uh-uh)\nOr a damn or a fuck or a shit\nSo suck my mothafuckin' dick\nThe Wake Up Show, let me tell you what it mean to me\nIt mean hard beats, hard rhymes, B-boys\nHip-hop, baby, all the way, forever", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c5658f7b5cfea9ae7d95a6df231cf89.773x768x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
