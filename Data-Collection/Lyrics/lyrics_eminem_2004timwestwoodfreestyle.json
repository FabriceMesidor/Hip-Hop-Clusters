party hard\nBut for real, I want Bobby Brown as my bodyguard\nAnd that's for real\nAnd that's the deal\nCause we got mass appeal\nAnd I don't think that they can really take it\nCause I always let my nuts hang\nLike I was doing push-ups naked\nThat's what I do\nIs drink the Aliz\u00e9 and\nThen I pass it to my man Proof and\nThen we start goofin' around\nAnd start spoofin'\nEverybody, yo we in the

to quit it dog\nCause Proof is low to the ground\nLike midget balls\nWith them bridges falls\nI lock ya ass up on the game\nAnd I visit all\nAnd it's like they signed\nThey said they did it all\nBecause they breeches small\nBut Imma tell you\nIn the likeness of the great 2Pac\nI'm hot\nAnd I'm fatter then Biggie Smalls\nAll y'all, need to recognize\nCause where I come from\nIt's still the East side\nOver there by Dresden\nWhere we make their heads spin\nBack then the back, ten\nMake his ass backspin\nThis action of crack-skin\nNigga, I eat more Vicodin\nThan the dots that's on the Pac-Man, board\nOh Lord\nGive me my sword\nOn top of that\nThe freestyles I got you can't afford\nBut they free\nYo, they only cost attention\nAnd did I mention\nI'm a boss with henchmen\nI send niggas to get ya\nYo, it's easy to do\nHow ya feel about this\nYo, the piece of the Proof\nThe piece of the clue\nThe pieces ya need\nThe pieces I got\nOn top of that my freestyle\nNever stutter\nMy words are butter-rock\nLike the niggas feel about us\nI say precise\nNigga feel fucked up like D-Nice, did\nFor getting Scott La Rock slain\nI rock 'caine and rock brains\nBack in the day, when ya block came\nGet ya block slain\nYa hood aborted\nHow I feel when they all get shortened\nHaha\nAnd I tell ya like this\nYa missing the ending\nI lift ya whole hood\nLike I'm fixing ya engine\nNigga,

believe\nI ball for cheese\nSurvival of the fittest\nOne of the trillest ever\nBow down, he severe\nFinna lock the market\nMarshall and Dre don' linked up\nWith the boy from the A\nI am chillaxin'\nFine linen in my fashion\nBump yo' questions\nWhy you askin', anythang?\nNiggas wanna know what I'm on\nRiding on my enemies\nGetting them gon' huh\nA crime businesses\nAnd you need homes\nSomething I can flip to increase my grip\nYo, why they on my dick?\nRide ya own lane\nI gotta handle\nTrust me lil' man\nYa need a little change\nHere's for starters\nI show ya how to come up\nWork on martyr\nLaunder ya cheese\nDo cash and beauty parlors\nHustle smarter\nGreen got me, haha\nGreen got me\nImma kill you Green\n\n[Swift]\nTo me it's like second nature\nI treat murders like a recreation\nAnd these niggas steadily changing\nThey laughs like Mason\nT.D. Jakes and all of these fake gangstas\nThey all be awaking\nBecause McVay can put a date on you homes\nI'll engrave in ya tombstone\nWith urination\nNow your whole funeral soon blown\nCommunication are for fools who be wasting time\nContemplating on making up\nI ain't that guy\nA grudge holder\nI used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora\nGet caught and tell 'em it's yours\nI can leave each one of ya body parts\nStranded in the middle of different forests\nHaving police ignore the shit\nNiggas get hung like ornaments\nWhile they hanging they trees\nThey get bombed like Vietnamese\nIn '46 or whatever year it was\nI gotta buzz\nAnd murdering you is all I love\nThis is Swifty McVay\nI ain't by myself\nI got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot\nAnd D12 is over, D12 is over here\nAnd yo' death is near\nAnd that's what's up\n\n[Eminem]\nThat's what's up\nPass this cup\nAnd then we blast you up\nFreestyle right off the massive truck\nWe got truckloads\nAnd uff, no\nCuff no and spin it backwards\nAnd play it back later\nCause all y'all haters rockin' gators\nAlligators, we see ya later\nWe ain't player haters\nBut yo check it out\nWe rockin' in our Navigators\nAnd we can sit back\nAnd we can stretch, we can check\nTrek, I mean catch, anything\nAnd we can fetch\nI'm slurring a little bit\nBut during the part that I was doing\nThe urination, upon that girl and\nWait a minute, I ain't goin'\nThere with my rap\nI ain't tryin' to be starting no crap\nBut yo, I be flowin'\nWith the stuff and I be knowin'\nThat when I start raking out them leaves\nI be hoein'\nAnd that's six in the mornin'\nAnd we can do it\nWe can get it on until the crack of dawn and\nWe can get it on with Tim Westwood\nWe can do whatever you want\nBring ya best cause\nWe do what we want to do\nOn this microphone\nCause we ought to know\nOr ought to inform you\nThat we get warm too warm\nSometimes we too hot to\nNot to spit this ish\nSpit it backwards and that said shit\nWhoops, I didn't mean to curse\nBut yo Proof, come back\nAnd lay one verse\n\n[Proof]\nI don't bite\nBut I spit the killin' venom\nWhen I'm older\nMy pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women\nYou can fight me here\nLike some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit\nBreaking laws off him dog\nAnd hypnotic, he got it\nAlthough he sound sober\nI ain't gay nowhere near gay\nI even hate a brown-noser\nIt's over, he killa\nGot no skills\nWhen these twenty-two spins\nAin't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels\nEven the bible kills\nI burn moral themes\nY'all pop like MTV\nAnd talk more than Coral Jeanne\nThe poor foreseen that there is a God\nI hope you guys slack\nCause when I lean back\nWithout the Terror Squad\nI gotta two bigger\nThen pistol move niggas whip\nI leave fool ass lit\nLike a cool cigarette\nI'm 'bout the peace dude\nIn fact the peaceful\nSince these niggas know my piece full\nAnd since they watchin' Beef too\nThey watchin' niggas out here\nThey see how we go\nBack in the day\nWith what, my people\nThe desert eagle\nLeaving people living in deceased holes\nHow they feel about that?\nMy truck is all diesel\nFreeze hoes\nThese people know it\nG.L. in detail\nThey break like Lee nail\nCrew is D12\nMore noise than a seashell\nCause we shall prevail\nWithout the Martin Luther King drill\n\n[Eminem]\nHow you know the main side, so attraction\nPsycho action\nThe man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson\nSick enough to do anything\nIn any video\nI could even pull out my whole titty yo\nWouldn't mean a damn thing\nWouldn't mean nothing\nLike if you went and pulled hamstring\nCause you a fake 'iatch\nI took the b off\nCause Imma be off with the switch\nJust like you\nCause you walk with a switch too\nThat's what I meant\nCause I represent, every single day\nPass it off to Stat\n\n[Stat Quo]\nI'm so slum\nI pull up in a double-quad deuce with no roof\nOn them big ass boots\nWhite tee, no suit\nJust me and my troop\nJam and be some hustlers\nWe are not a group\nGrizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless\nMy advice, my life\nI have them wetter than diapers\nShe want me to buy big jewels and wife her\nFuck the bitch tonight\nBut tomorrow won't like her\nGo back to the club\nAnd get a new one like her\nAnd that's what I call completing a cypher\nWrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper\nWhen a Stat come through\nYour girlfriend get hyper\n\n[Swift]\nYou be in the ocean with the worms and maggots\nI'm what overdoses do for an addict\nAnd after static with me\nHoly ghosts will be given a homes\nAutomatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole\nI target ya dome\nWatch that shit get blown\nLike a head gasket\nSee I'm rabid\nAnd known to foam acid\nI accurately mastered battering bastards\nI don't get charged for assault and battery\nThey be after me\nCause I smashed 'em\nHappily answering\nAny nigga that asks me would happen\nI tell 'em the truth laughin'\nThat's just me\nA five-star general\nWith aura that's horrible\nI be smackin' ya captain\nTurn a corpse into ya corporal\nThey won't know who did it\nTell your lieutenant\nWhen an arsenal is set\nFor all of those threats of coming close\nNo you won't\nWith a Stephen King mentality\nYa don't believe me?\nI can bring the casualty to ya family\nAnd that's what's up\nI got D12 in the house\nYa know what we about\nAre you a man, a mouse?\nAnd it seems like you a mouse\nRunning in that hole\nJust cause you hoe\nAnd everybody know\nMcVay yeah\n\n[Proof]\nSee I'm going out\nBlow 'em up\nThey wanna see me, what I'm all about\nPull 'em out\nI'm in the club\nGot the snub\n'Bout to bust it out\nBoy hear me, 'bout to hear me\n'Bout to cuss a dog\nI can't take it\n\n[Eminem]\nCan't cuss it dog\nTake it dog\nAyo, get with the\nWith the girl\nBetter take it off\nShe got the bra better shake it y'all\nAyo, check it out\nI'm about to bull\nAnd wreck it out\n\n[All]\nSmack 'em with shovels\nSmack 'em with shovels\nSmack 'em with shovels\nSmack 'em
