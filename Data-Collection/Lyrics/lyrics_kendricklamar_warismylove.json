What I got to prove?\nI guess war is my love\n\n[Verse 2]\nMake sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing\nYou know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it\nCause I can hide in the mist, hop out\nAnd crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6\nI'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick\nI lead the pack, I follow no rules\nI see the traps, I know you're close to\nFalling on your face, unload, reload\nHand me another case, explode, explode\nThe fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise\nI know you hope your help is close by\n\n[Hook]\nI will, I will climb the highest mountain\nBefore the flood comes\nAnd all my fight is drowning in blood\nWhat I got to lose? What I got to prove?\nI guess war is my love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/53f8cd28c12fe430bd8cf079d9f5f9d3.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
