Cryin' in a childish tone\nTerrified of dyin' a painful death alone\nDon't smile unless your innocent child\nThe power of God is gonna get you through your tao\nThrown like a hit from the best\nTake it in a slump\nHaha\nFeel it in your chest\nConquerin' the world with the words\nLeadin' the children like herds\nI can feel it buildin'\nI'm about to explode\nI'm walkin' on the crossroad\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\n\n[Verse 2]\nViolins and trumpets play\n25 thousand people in a golden sleigh\nOn their way to the promised land\nDeliverance\nBut yet some don't understand\nRough on a late night drill\nAfter midnight\nKill or be killed\nSoldiers, warriors, mercenaries\nRush at each other\nOn the combat zone\nSupreme power on the throne\nLighting strikes in every home\nTerrified men run down the street\nSo many dead bodies\nIt's hard to eat\nBut we gotta rise\nAbove the wall\nTo see what no man has seen before\nBlindin' light\nTo guide you through the night\nGod is on your side\nYou got to fight!\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\n(Get ready for the battle)\n\n[Verse 3]\nHomicide\nSuicide\nDeath\nBOOM!\nAin't nobody left\nOoooh! It's startin' to take effect\nYou're on your knees\nYou're scared to death\nTornadoes with a thousand people spinnin'\nA fight at the cross\nAnd now god is winnin'\nThe whole Earth cracks in half\nThe sea turns red from the bloodbath\nAbandoned buildings burned into a maze\nTerrified, you feel the fire blaze\nThe ground can't hold your weight\nYou reach out to grab the pearly gates\nWhole continents floatin' out in space\nNever again will you see the human race\n19 angels lead the devil straight to hell!\nTorment!\nPain!\nWhat you see and hear\nYou can't explain\nAll your life\nSo many played the game\nNever realizing there's a flame\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads\nPeople livin' in a shack, at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin' crack, at the crossroads\nNow they stab you in the back, at the crossroads\nEverybody's gettin' jacked at the crossroads", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e280045bd851825ad1c5570d3eb2a6f6.999x999x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
