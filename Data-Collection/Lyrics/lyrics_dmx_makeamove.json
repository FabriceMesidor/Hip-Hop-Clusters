I'm hungry too\nSo I'mma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew\nNiggas that ain't never had, and doin bad\nWill be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad\nGrab your bags, it's about to go down\nWe goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI gots to make a move and make it soon\nGots to take a block and make it boom\nWe comin through so make some room\nFound somethin that could be somethin if I pump it up\nThis kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up\nThe purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells\nBut I'mma crush him with the black 40 double-L's\nI send two niggas back up top, and come back\nWe chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop\nIt's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin\nKillin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin\nLook here, I'm what they call a true hustler\nCause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six\nThen I don't trust ya\nAnd we'll bust ya over somethin petty like a few dollars\nPut somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (\"Ahhhhh!\")\nYou think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow\nAnd fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'\n\nChorus 2X\n\n[DMX]\nI spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich\nAnd a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick\nNiggas is family now, and we stand strong\nThirty niggas on six blocks, makin the cash long\nShit is good, because niggas gettin what they been wantin\nAnd we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin\nStick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em\nI keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em\nThem motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us\nAnd I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us\nSo we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house\nIt's holdin em strong, it's a stash house\nI got runners that work for twelve hour shifts\nAnd when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff\nBut I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit\nAin't tryin to hear jack shit, fuck the black bitch\nI ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run\nIf I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun\nGot bitches to transport without an escort\nI'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport\nLocal police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us\nIt be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure\nJust so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)\nCause I'm a hustlin motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down\n\nChorus 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57efb548310ed90e73d9200fd01a3e59.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DMX"}
