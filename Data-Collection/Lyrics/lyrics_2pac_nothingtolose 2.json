I can hear her crying in the bedroom\nPraying for money but never think would she be dead soon\nAm I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else\nI'm thirteen, can't feed myself\nCan I blame daddy cause he left me?\nWish he would've hugged me\nToo much like him, so my mama don't love me\nOn my own at a early age, I'm getting paid\nAnd I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid\nWhere did I go astray?\nI'm hanging in the back streets\nRunning with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?\nCan't turn back, my eyes on the prize\nI got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die\nSay good-bye to the bad guy\nThat one, you fucked, when you passed by\nBuck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly\nDo or die walk a mile in my shoes\nThen you'd be crazy too\n\n[Hook]\nWith nothing to lose\n[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali\nGot nothing to lose\n[Ice Cube] That\u2019s why I got gang-related rhymes\n\nGot nothing to lose\n[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali\nGot nothing to lose\n[Ice Cube] That\u2019s why I got gang-related rhymes\n(x3)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI thank the Lord for my many blessings\nThough I'm stressing keep a vest for protection\nFrom the barrel of a Smith & Wesson\nAnd all my niggas in the pen, here we go again\nAin't nothing separating us from a MAC-10\nBorn in the ghetto as a hustler, older\nStraight soldier, bucking at them bustas\nNo matter how you try, niggas never die\nWe just retaliate with hate, then we multiply\nSee me striking down the block hitting corners\nMobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna\nAin't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways\nTHUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays\nLet the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga\nZig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga\nIn a high speed chase with the law\nThe realest motherfucker that you ever saw\nI'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, I'm high\nLiving like I ain't afraid to die\nAnd if you could walk a mile in my shoes\nThen you'd be crazy too\n\n[Hook]\nWith nothing to lose\n[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali\nGot nothing to lose\n[Ice Cube] That\u2019s why I got gang-related rhymes\n\nGot nothing to lose\n[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali\nGot nothing to lose\n[Ice Cube] That\u2019s why I got gang-related rhymes\n(x3)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAin't no escape from a deadly fate\nAnd every day there's a million black bodies put away\nI'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope\nMama told me to leave, cause she was broke\nSometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window\nAlone, on my own, I'm a criminal\nGot no love from the household\nI'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'Motherfuck peace!'\nI got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?\nLive the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true\nI wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?\nLord forgive me, if you feel me\nCause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope\nLittle skinny motherfucker wanting dough\nI hated cutting suckers with my razor blade\nBut everyday it's a struggle to get major paid\nAnyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity\nAnd ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime\nIf you could walk a mile in my shoes\nThen you'd be crazy too\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nThey wonder what type nigga be a THUG LIFE nigga\nWe be the craziest, motherfucker!\nYou know!\nThey wonder what type nigga be a THUG LIFE nigga\nWe be the craziest!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f924e981b74c6d754d2c9da26f83f15.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "2Pac"}
