James & Monk Kaza\n\n\n[ Scarface ]\nThis for my niggas doin life in the trap\nStayin' focused, tryina double they paper and give it back\nTo the hood where they come from, cause niggas need a boost\nCause the opportunities in these ghettos are minimal\nIt's pitiful how they got me doin' time\nFor a crime that I ain't never committed, the bottomline\nIs I'm a black man, so my S-K-I-N is my S-I-N\nAnd unless I win, I'll be headed to a cell in the pen\nAnd when I come home, I go right back in\nShit, it's like the hood has got a heart and a soul, that's cold\nThese little children die before they old\nThe situations make a nigga feel as useless as he is\nThe president's recruitin' all the kids\nDyin' for a country that he know ain't even his\nAnd mama loses sleep and shed tears\n\n\n[ Chorus 2X ]\nOpen your ears all my niggas, this is street news\nBroadcastin live from the ghetto, this is street blues\nWhere niggas dyin' every day in the streets, fool\nYeah we on the grind cause our kids gotta eat too\n\n\n[ B. James ]\nI grew up with a dollar and a dream\nStrap the silencer on the beam if you try to intervene\nThe school of hard knocks, all the scholars turn to fiends\nNo jobs in the city, all we got is triple beams\nA dirty game, niggas'll rob you or your team\nPolice'll set you up and every hour it's a sting\nYoung niggas lose they life just tryina get some bling\nMy last name James, so I gotta be a king\nDisrespectin' the fam and suffer the repercussion\nIf you ain't talkin money, my nigga, end of discussion\nMOB for life, so tell these bitches it's nothin'\nDon't even come around if you ain't givin' me nothin'\nI live like a boss with thoughts of a made man\nYou tryina get laid, man, I'm tryina get paid, man\nWe hustle in the snow and watch for the Ray-bans\nSo them pretty boy dudes get popped in they wave, man\nAmen\n\n\n[ Chorus 2X ]\n\n\n[ Monk Kaza ]\nYeah, since I was born, entire life has been a struggle\nOnly got two choices - either starve or you hustle\nSee, I know what it's like to be broke, man\nTrust me, dog, I know what it's like to be po', fam\nI need help to control this hunger\nThe streets keep callin', how the fuck they get this number?\nGotta grind through the rain and thunder\nThat's why I feel it's forever street blues till the day that I'm under\nBut it gotta be a way out, the plan had been laid out\nIt's takin' forever, dog, it's feelin' like a stake-out\nNo more short cuts, focus on the straight route\nIt's been too long, man, it's time for me to break out\nDo it for my fam cause I'm the one they depend on\nAs long as I'm alive you got a shoulder to lean on\nI got a lotta love cause my team strong\nAnd fate on my side, so I continue to dream on\nTill then\n\n\n[ Chorus 2X ]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/41da9c65fd4611628310671ecc237634.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
