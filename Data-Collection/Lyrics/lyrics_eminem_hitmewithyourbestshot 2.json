(What happened?)\nMarshall stopped rapping (Damn!)\nI guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh)\nHit the matress (Okay)\nPistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)\nHit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing\nD12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?\nOur clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen\nPopping pills and Aspirin\nAnd I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life\nTold him that my rhymes just have to be tight\nSo I figured that I would grab the mic\nLike a nigga bout to rhyme right after Christ\nSometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight\nGrab an o and I have to light\nThat's only right, living like a rock star is the only life!\nAnd we are, six grown men, who are old friends\nTo my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton\nAll the way down, I'mma hold them\nD12 nigga, till the world end (D12!)\n\n[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nPut me in my place!\nCome on!

Put me in my place!\n\n[Verse 2: Swifty]\nA lot of niggas try to underestimate me\nTill I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea\nY'all been placed on a contract for hating\nI'mma waste them, one by one, for tainting\nMy ability to kill a facility, I'mma send them to Satan\nFast as a child rapist facing\nLife or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting\nThey gon' lock me up under the basement\nI'm a one man army, marine and navy\nYou done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane\nAnd maybe I bite the face off your baby\nFor anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie\nI'mma break their Halo\nPut them on the reaper's payroll\nErase them and hang their soul\nIt ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll\nWith names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold\n\n[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nPut me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\n\n[Verse 3: Kuniva]\nI know you thought we were done, we rose up\nGot a gun to make your whole inside fold up\nThey hit us with the best shot and we're still standing\nSo tell the world it can lick our scrotum\nStraight soldiers, who wanna stunt?\nWho wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?\nWho wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways\nEvery time I roll up I'mma keep it blunt\nWhere did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?\nY'all did it big like Costco\nAnd we back in this bitch like a tampon\nStill talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap\nAnd you will soon slip, on some buffoon shit\nMy hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick\nSo stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive\nAnd strapped, don't make me use it\n\n[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nPut me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\nCome on! Put me in my place!\n\n[Verse 4: Eminem]\nAight, here's where I come in at\nI came in this game with, bad intentions\nAnd I ain't budged, not even an inch since then\nI'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive\nI'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in\nHand, it's like I'm holding the insulin\nSo you might wanna button it like Benjamin\nI ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men\nStep right in this mark with my henchmen and\nWalk, straight to the stage\nI ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face\nFall back, little cocksucker\nI ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way\nGet 'em? Shattered, fucking A\nBeen this way since B.C., what can I say?\nI'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape\nDon't get turned to a vegetable dick face\nYou ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois\nD12 spitting flames like flamethrowers\nSpit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors\nThat cut with the same force as chainsaws\nHope you're coming with your A game\nCause things have changed in this game\nIsn't the same game, boys\nThe stakes have been raised, better make lemonade\nWhen they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us\n\n[Hook: Pat Benatar (Sampled)]\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nHit me with your best shot!\nPut me in my place!\nCome on!
