V\nI messed up the count, Kev winked at me\nWhat I learned is niggas need paper to burn\nAnd you gotta spread love when cats is fucked up\nYou can't be lazy, for niggas that's bad fuck\nSometimes you move quiet and lay upin the cut (whattup)\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI learned if you talk to much you get that ass shot up\nFollow your dreams, and watch the cash pile up\nI used to be in Queens with my man Black Just\nBefore he got killed, now that nigga was real\nHe took me to the crib, showed me how gangsters live\nTook me to hot blocks, showed me big knots\nHim and Richard Porter used to tease me and what not\nYou ain't movin pies, so your car can be fly\nUsed to run to Big Kev before he got knocked\nWhen niggas was stuntin and wouldn't let me on the block\n125th in the Beemer with AZ\nHe gave a bum 50 dollars that really taught me\nThat being a gangster don't mean you're all bad\nAnd niggas respect you when they know you got cash\nRemember Big dave had the dust on smash\nI was amazed the lifestyle was so fast\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI remember Remy showed my his first 8th ki'\nThat was before Queens had blood in the street\nStretch from BK had the pretty gold Benz\nHe took me out to Brooklyn where he was gettin some ends\nLet me state this again, I ain't gotta pretend\nThey was playing the money game and I wanted in\nI was just a young boy with dangerous friends\nIf it wasn't for rap, who knows where I would've been\nI took a hustlas heart to make the top of the charts\nBig Chuck when to jail when i was ready to start\nI guess i was destin, God pulled us apart\nBut I admit, getting that street money is a art\nI was so many players I knew back in the D\nLike Cuban Alberto from Mi-ami\n'86 that nigga's Benz had TV's\nOnly God knows what these niggas mean to me\nReal talk\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e00cf56336ec8915e2fa3b2b2e7502d.377x377x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
