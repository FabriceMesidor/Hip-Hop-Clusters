Prodigy]\nI used to be in love with this bitch named E&J\nDon't fuck with her no more now I fuck with Tanqueray\nTanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold (Yeah that bitch)\nLast name was English and the first name Olde\nBut Gold couldn't take the dick it made me lazy\nWe split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy\nNow me and Dainy, we been together ever since\nOur love combines to form a science, what is this\nI bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (word)\nNow that she's open everybody want to tap something\nGo get your own don't make me have to fucking clap something\nI love my shorty more than life now ain't that something\nTo love you Dainy more than living itself\nEven though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health\nWhen I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf\nThey say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth\nBut I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby\nThe Dainy you know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady\nMet her back in '89 now she's 22 (word)\nActing like she 40, she said all I need is a man to support me\nBesides, you from the 41st side of things (word)\nAnd Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings\nPushin' Lexuses, wearing fat diamond rings\nMy cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational\nThe 12th Street crew move back when we come through\n\n[Chorus: Prodigy]\nI think the whole world's going insane\nI fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain\nI think the whole world's going insane\nI fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain\nI think the whole world's losing its brain\nI fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (what, what)\nI think the whole world's going insane\nI fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nTommy Hil was my nigga, and others couldn't figure\nHow me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor\nHad to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures\nSaid a Brinks is coming through, at Fashion Avenue\nAt Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew\nOf motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers\nTold me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers\nI told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker\nNegotiate the deal with them other money stalkers\nDiesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course\nNautica'll navigate to keep us on course\nPolo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss\nI said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack\nGot a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back\nTimb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle\nScope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel\nTook the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face\nAll them other kids they had they tools aimed at space\nLevi had the snub so you know they getting laced\nDonna Karan was cryin', 'cause mad shells was flyin'\nDamn all we want is a piece of the pie and\nNike scooped the sacks cause he moves like Air\nThrew them shits up in the trunk now we up out here\nGot back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper\nHelly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper\nSo she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice\nEverybody in the crew didn't think it was nice\nI guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what (What?)\nGuess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut\n\n[Bridge: Q-Tip]\nWhen you play with crime sometimes it's not too fly\nEven though the goods look deceiving to the eye\nThe end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, eyo)\nThat's why you got to walk on by, walk on by\nWalk on by, walk on by, walk on by\n\n[Verse 3: Havoc]\nMy man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock\nNow Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop\nOne sip I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock\nThe more she started givin' me the stronger I got\nPushed her off to the crew then she started gettin' jealous\nSteamed 'cause I spent more cream with the fellas\nFuck them niggas spend that cheese on me\nSee if they be around when you need pussy\nThen I thought to myself, yo this trick is right\nGathered up all my dough, so I spent the night\nI can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock\nNiggas started riffin' why you trickin' yo this shit must stop\nMoms like you need to see the AA\nBetter hope they help your ass out on the same day\nBut never that, I got the shakes so I need that\nSon call me stressed out I just be that\nBut when it comes to Henn Rock dun I need that\nShe's my shorty for life so fuck the feedback\n\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nI think the whole world's goin' insane\nI fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain\nI think the whole world's lost its brain\nI sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain\n\n[Outro: Prodigy]\nTo all the brothers who ain't here\nPour out a little somethin' on the floors man\nTime to get a little bent do our thing, word up\nThe 41st side Queens, bent you know what I mean\nIt's an everyday thing\nHenny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy\nDainy take me away, Dainy take me away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b07e53ad94c52f45245db1c1d49e6b00.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
