Listen close\n\n[Royce]\nI feel like I'm at the height of my jump while y'all pivotin'\nWhile y'all visitin' I'm livin' here, ball in a year\nThe hundreds and fifties in cheeseburgers\nThe twenties is balled up\nYou lookin' for singles they all in the air\nThe hundreds of bitches that we murdered\nWe ain't literally speakin'\nWe just team up and we squirt all up in they hair\nGive us some coke and a promise\nGive us some nut in the throat\nShe suck till she spittin' up coconut vomit\nGet it?\nPardon me miss\nI'm just fed up with the way the system is set up\nThe shit that they had me livin' in prison was better\nRhymin' perfection\nIs it a set up?\nTo give me a year in the county around the time of election?\nOr should I just shut up?\nZip it or kick it?\nTry to get you to picture the vision\nLyrically, this is my petition to picket\nFree me or, eventually see me\nThe heat in my belt hangs an inch from my pee pee like a key to my cell\nTo censor me is to censor my CD which inspires me\nTo spit what will eventually be the key to myself\nTimes is changin'\nEverybody's Gods the same\nBut they minds ain't\nSo I talk about they kind is dangerous\nBlacks against Affirmative Action sounds as insane\nAs the war in Iraq while Saddam is hangin'\nA dead man's a dead man\nAin't two of a kind\nYou can't break me\nI'm head standin' doin' my time\nIt's nothin'\nMy crew bakin' my bread while I'm jail\nHad niggas buffin' my boots and makin' my bed\nTime will tell who down to bail\nIf you gettin' down and how wild your arms will flail\nWhen I bomb I unwind like I'm a spawn from hell\nThe only shots you takin' are those that evolve from shells\n(The following name has been edited to keep the peace)\nSomething is on your mind then nigga say it\nYou scared?\nIf I was tryin' to X you out then you know you'd be dead\nYou need beef with me like you need a hole in your head\nYou little Stone Throwers\nYou signed-to-a-label-ass-niggas ain't sayin' shit till you own yours\nWhenever them triggers is buckin'\nI got to write a label to Trojan requestin' them niggas to up it\nCause my dick get bigger\nMy balls get larger\nTo a size that my drawers can't swallow\nFor y'all it suicide\nThe verbal amphetamine\nThe quotes is cold places, inserted with Ketamine\nSpoken, they pulsate\nEarthquake\nHouston we got a problem\nI'm settin' your turf straight\nYour troops I private piles 'em up\nThe holocaust (cost) you pay is Hitler's\nWay\nYou dis me, and get merked for Christmas\nBut the curse if gift less\nI'm the first to spit shit\nFrom a podium\nGo to your local church to get this\nY'all sell chickens I only serve the biscuit\nLeave your blood on the street\nYou get curbed with blisters\nChicken noodle soup your brains, let it rain\nAnd I clear it out\nAll the vets say I'm official\nAnd you can ask Diddy\nBut now that I'm doing time like Shyne\nNigga I'll probably +Press Play+ on a pistol\nPolitical prisoner\nGot ammo around my torso like Rambo\nBanana around my waist like I'mma gorilla\nIt's time to apply my pace now on the fo' rilla\nBandanna around my face like dead prez\n\n[Woman's voice]\nStatik Selektah\n\n[Royce]\nTake a breather\n\nYou are now ridin' with a flow the fliest\nSelassie inside\nWho Jesus chose\nWho Hov inspires\nExtreme formula in this chess game\nAccept change\nYou the king\nWe the queen corner a\nBest thing spittin' since a geyser\nThe methane rhythm, it's supplier\nWritten with the fire\nDoused by the best team\nWith him when he ridin'\nOut\nCause the check flame when it get divided\nBout\nNiggas livin' through decisions\nLearnin' ain't givin' you the business\nQuittin' is a privilege\nSuited at a funeral, killin' any witness\nOver dead prez's\nI'm here to view the digits\nClearin' out the air space\nPointin' out who ain't dead\nGods gift to this world\nI'm going out with reindeer\nComin' back and bang ya\nLeap Year is a thang of the past\nWhen I return and spring from my ashes\nLike a deranged angel\nWho came cause you asked\nBut I ain't here to save you, I came for your ass\nIt's sorta like the reaper\nBlowin' at your concert\nWe write through the speakers\nKnowin' that it's God's work\nRap is a prison that'll trap you in freedom\nThe contradiction of your past\nThe after you see Him\nI don't have to proceed with no master's degree\nTo change the art\nI came and waxed the museum\nI saw, I conquered\nI paused my disc to do a bid\nSo y'all can spit bout how you do it big\nNigga is you grown or you a kid?\nYou trash\nAnd don't make me blast\nAnd turn your dome into a lid\nOpen your mind\nPut led in your brain\nYou dope for your time\nI'm ahead of your game\nThe door's open\nAnd I'm in it\nI'm so focused\nYou still focusin'\nAnd when I'm finished you gonna be hopin' it still opens\nMaybe I lucked up?\nEither I'm straight crazy or slavery got a nigga fucked up\nEminem and Kramer\nThe minimum will blame 'em\nThe average nigga got the word spinnin' in they chambers\nThe average nigga raised by the average nigga, aye\nIt's the average nigga way\nTo say \"nigga\" with an \"a\"\nRiddle 'em and hit 'em with the K\nLet it speak when he fiddle with the trigger\nLet 'em kill 'em with the say\nSodom or Gomorrah\nWhich one are you the more of?\nChevy's sittin' on 30's and 20's on the Saurus\nFiendin' for that spot\nThe money bout to burn a hole in my pocket\nSo I got to extinguish that with a \"Blao\"\nPut it out with a Phantom\nBring it out on the block\nWith no driver\nHoes, y'all wanna drive or not!\nI gotta peel the peddle\nA lot of troops done died\nWhy deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?\nGotta peel the peddle\nA lot of troops done died\nWhy deal with the devil, knowin' I got a truce with God?\nI gotta peel the peddle\nA lot of troops done died\nWhy deal with the devil, knowin' that I got a truce with God?\n\nNickel", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f966eb73a81b58069fb8aff648de307.700x700x1.jpg"}],
