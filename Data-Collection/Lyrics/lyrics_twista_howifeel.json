Yeah, I remember that\n\n[Verse 2: South]\nI'm surrounded by these demons and they drive me crazy\nThey love to see you fail, I guess that's why they hate me\nLately, I been stayin' away\nSee, you wouldn't believe the bullshit, but now it don't amaze me\nI grew up gettin' beat on, my world ain't got no heat on\nThey ask me what I be on, but then find out that they need some\nThat's why I did this new song, that's why I keep that two long\nBeen in too deep for too long\nThose who doubted me and want my way gon' prove wrong\n\n[Verse 3: Johnny Maycash]\nYeah, to anybody who doubted me\nAnd my whole damn team wrong\nWake up in the mornin', this a theme song\nI'm gonna make a lot of money of this green (-)\nBut I refuse to ever sell my damn soul\nMiddle of the summer, but my flow's cold\nI want to meet up, but your bitch is for my old hoes\nAll I need is a beat, I'm goin' loco\nYeah, a lot of people tellin' me that I'm next to blow\nThey can keep the fame, I just want the dough\nIf I hear my family eat, then we good to go\nI got to stack this bread, then I'm out the door\n\n[Hook: 1Mic]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/cb728d5e1e8bb2d6a49c6d54b6969b6c.1000x994x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Twista"}
