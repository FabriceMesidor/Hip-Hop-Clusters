Transatlantic import\nSlave and bought, secret relations between blacks and Jews\nMight set a fuse off in the head\nMany dead lynch hung, swung from trees\nBrothers in the struggle together, eat from one pot\nHold each other down to the sneaker\nNothing come between us\nFast money and chicks, did it to the best of cliques\nIt's sickening... huh\n\n[Hook: Masta Killa]\nIt's me and you son, forever in the struggle\nNo doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto\nWill you soon follow, a better tomorrow\n...For a better tomorrow\nIt's me and you son, forever in the struggle\nNo doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto\nWill you soon follow, a better tomorrow\n...For a better tomorrow\n\n[Verse 3: GZA]\nI catch a few flashbacks about, going through the struggle\nHow we used to make dollars, from all the snow we shoveled\nIn a broke neighborhood, where the kids often dream\nAbout a lavish life, that is mostly seen in the screen\nWhere some dreams are quickly cut short, due to gang violence\nFrom loud guns, that kept witnesses, in deep silence\nWas it bad timing? Jealousy from too much shining?\nOr a set up, from a girl that he wined, kept dining\nIt's a known fact, they will attack, cause it's like that\nAnd depending on the, kind of impact, that strike back\nIn a town where the talk is cheap and, beef is brief\nA mother sobs uncontrollably, and exhibit the grief\nLarge holes in the front door, of a housing tenement\nAllows room to retaliate, so conflict is imminent\nThis hate in the brain, destroys the cells like cancer\nEven experts are stuck with more questions than answers\n\n[Hook: Masta Killa]\nIt's me and you son, forever in the struggle\nNo doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto\nWill you soon follow, a better tomorrow\n...For a better tomorrow\nIt's me and you son, forever in the struggle\nNo doubt, we hustle, survival is the motto\nWill you soon follow, a better tomorrow\n...For a better tomorrow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db9b33eb227f3589b17cba9834972c7.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "MF DOOM"}
