Like I forget\nI love it how you move it because\nYou do it to my dick\nYou got that back seat Caddy pussy\nYou should let me ride\nNo time to take her panties off\nSo move 'em to the side\nI'm back go big chaining, I'm big slanging\nI'm smoking good: Rick James\nAnd I'm training ladies, I'm bitch taming\nI'm rubbered up cause your bitch raining\nI'm all in your butt like beyo-, beyo-, beyo-, bitch\nLet's make it quicker than tea-time\nI got her legs doing a peace sign\nI'm in between her like halftime\nIt's \"hit ass time\"\nAnd I gotta go cause I'm running late\nEven for CP time\nHit once and it was new sheets time\n\n[Hook]\n\nMami I realize that I'm mannish\nSpeak a language of love like Spanish\n\"Quero Fugir\"\nI'm so obscene and know what I mean?\nYeah sorry that was Portuguese\nAnd I speak with ease\nPlease (aha) get on them knees\nI gotta penny for your thoughts\nIf you know what I mean\n\n[Hook]\n\nDon't be offended babe\nBy what I say\nIt's just a game\nAnd how I play\nPillage and plunder\nCall me ya plumber\nKnock on this wood\nGet rocked by this thunder [x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1db10915bf07ae763610bb53d1717887.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
