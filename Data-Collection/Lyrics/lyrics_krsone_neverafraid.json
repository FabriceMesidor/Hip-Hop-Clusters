You killed it on this shit\n\nListen to the track, this goes back\nStripped down, cats don't get down like this\nBut true revolutionaries get down like this\nStreet activists be surrounding Kris\nI gets down, I don't just pound my fist\nGreedy executives, y'all can like drown in piss\nCause raw Hip Hop, man it sounds like this\nI got pounds of this, I spit rounds of this\nMan pass me the mic, I go to town on this\nWalk out with a cap and gown on Kris\nCause I graduate, man I'm glad they hate this\nI float cause I never hesitate, I'm wait-less\nSome of y'all can't take this\nI'm like the ocean, you what a lake is\nYo, who wanna \"rhyme on\"?\nYou cats backing up\nWhen the Blastmaster KRS start acting up\nYeah that gat be up, six-five, I strut with two legs\nI see the top of all of you's heads\nAnd that's symbolic of Hip Hop\nIt's like a jungle sometimes and we like the treetops\nCause when I always spit fly, and rappers get sprayed\nI always was taught man, never to be afraid\nWho wanna \"rhyme on\"?\nAlways spit fly and never be afraid, I'm timeless\nWe the plus man, they the minus\nNothing sounds like us\nThese rappers are starting to sound like the black versions of Imus\nMe? I'm Akhenaten and writing on papyrus\nWe old school, don't try us\nLet me ask, who wanna \"rhyme on\"?\nLet me get this rhyme on, let me turn my sign on\nThese lyrics will shine on\nIf this ain't Hip Hop then I'm wrong\nAnd I'mma be wrong, cause this is it\nI take it all the way back to the boom, the boom, the bip\nKRS-One, who's gonna jump on this?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7124063b9019b7aa2798bff144643c27.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
