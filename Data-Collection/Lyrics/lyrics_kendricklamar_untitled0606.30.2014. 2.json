But don't be scared of me, girl\nI can explain\nI know it's foreign to you\nI know it's hard to believe\nGod give me the favor\nLet me explain\nMore than a compliment\nAnd I could use some assistance, let me show you how\nI can explain\nOh shando! I spin around two times\nI'll be there with the answer\nLet me explain\n\n[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]\nI'm bizarre, avant-garde\nBoth sides of me are evenly odd\nIt's attractive, you're intrigued\nAm I mortal man or make believe?\nAnything you want\nI can explain\nI can explain it\nAny misunderstandings, baby\nLet me explain\nI can explain it\nWhy don't you sit and talk to me?\nI can explain\nLet me explain it, ah yeah\nLet me explain\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented\nEstranged baby, no I'm not ashamed\nI recommend every inch of your lunatic ways\nPraise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more\nYou know the male species can be redundant\nI mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her\nBetween sheets, covers and pillows\nI'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero\nI'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero\nCause you believe in me\nNo you're not easily impressed\nBut I possess qualities that you need to see\nLook at my flaws, look at my flaws\nLook at my imperfections in awe\nLook how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause\nAnd yours equally valued\nYou stick out like an alien compared to those around you\nAnd that's alright because I like it\nYou and me are the same\nHopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change\nBecause I know for sure who you are\n\n[Bridge 2: Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green]\nI can explain\nYour mama raised you, your daddy raised you\nHand washing your clothes on Sunday\nLet me explain\nWalking your brother to school, three miles away\nTo feed his body and soul\nI can explain\nDon't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels\nLet me explain\nI wanna know what you think\nI wanna pick your brain when I see you\nBut don't you ever\nLet me explain\nOh shando! I spin around two times\nA blessing in disguise\nI can explain\nI know for sure who you are\nYou're the goddess of the odd\nI am yours\nI can explain\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nI am yours\nI am yours\nI am yours\nI am yours\nNdiseza ndingene laduma vumile\nNdiseza ndingene laduma vumile", "image": "https://images.genius.com/45790022edf45dc9796e781a40cabb42.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
