I just left this place...\nI get out and started walkin askin Frog, \"What's up?\"\nLookin at me dazed like, \"Face, it's all f**ked up...\"\nI move a little closer tryin to see who it is\nAnd I saw his baby mama in tears holdin his kids...\n\n[Chorus]\n[incomprehensible]\n\n[VERSE 2]\nAnd it was then it finally hit me\nI'm standing here nervous as I can be\nIt was nothing that can prepare me for what i'm finna see\nI'm praying this is a dream and i'm bout to awake\nBut the closer I got the more I realize fate\nWasn't fair to change for me\nAnd why would I think so\nMy homie had a date with death\nHe had to make though\nI'm feelin eerie, I'm liftin up the yellow tape\nBy the time I get to the scene\nThey rollin this away\nI wonder whats under this sheet, my knees get weak\nTo the point i had to take me a seat\nThis shits deep\nWhen they put a nigga down that you was raised around\nWhat was once a minor statement's turnin' major now\nNever woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal\nHad it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible\nThey say its life and death in the slum\nHe had his reasons I shoulda believed him\nAnotha soul no longer breathin'\nHate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience\nMy nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[VERSE 3]\nAnd everybody thinkin' its murder, but homicide sayin self-inflicted\nBy the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen\nWho coulda predicted\nBut the detectives who was fishin'\nFucked up that the family had to see dad in his position\nAll i remember was us doin what we did\nTo survive in these streets where we lived\nWe was kids growin up in this environment\nNothing but trouble\nYou either struggled or you hustled\nFolded the bubble\nGrade school til we dropped out, we had a plan\nWe was either finna be rich or die like a man\nWe did it all for the love of the hood, every journey\nImagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney\nI wonder what was goin on\nYou shoulda said that you was feelin' mad\nI coulda talked you outta that\nBut never will i see you again\nNor will your kids\nNor will your family or your friends\nIts the end\nNot even words I write in this song\nCan right that wrong\nMy nigga is gone and life goes on\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4a83e0fa554b5f2e5c5acce61362bbe7.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Scarface"}
