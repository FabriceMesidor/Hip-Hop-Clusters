Hell no\nWhat you mean, \"Is this is all we got\"?\nThat's it\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's Christmas time in the Montgomery home\nDaddy's actin' all crazy again\nMama got herself a bloody nose\nDaddy slapped her in the face again\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhy they always gotta fight so much? Damn\nMama face swole, me and my bros in a panic state\nIf that's the case yo, I can't just stay around this\nEverything was fine, we just had dinner, we got all the He-Mans\nBattle Cat, Adam and Cringer, even Castle Greyskull and Snake Mountain\nNow we sit and listen to y'all argue about how y'all planned this day\nAnd y'all just admitted to us Santa fake so Kid Vishis just ran away poutin'\nNow I gotta go and console him\nHe wasn't nothin' but a spoiled little boy then\nLittle naive with an innocent cry, all he ever wanted to do was fit in with us\nAnd y'all bought him a pair of fake Timberlands and put 'em in a real Timberland box\nI never forget them boots, they was called \"Rugged Outbacks\"\nMama went and found them at Payless and made us promise not to say nothin'\nThen Pop came in like he ain't know nothin' about it\nLike, \"Judy you gon' send that boy out in public like that?\"\n\"He'll be just fine, these kids ain't 'bout to be\nLookin' down at his feet for no tree,\" and she really meant that\nMeanwhile, this little arrogant nigga caught himself stuntin' on me and Greg with 'em talkin' about, 'Where y'all Timbs at?\"\nBut he was too young to detect sarcasm so we was like, \"Nigga, where yo' Timbs at?\" Pf-haha\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's Thanksgiving in the Montgomery home\nGreg just came in here drunk again\nNow mama tryna cover for him\nShe afraid my daddy gon' punch him again\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy you gotta get drunk so much? Damn\nI wish you would just stay where you was at\nInstead of comin' home all rude and disrespectin' all our father rules and shit, man\nThe mood done switched me and Vishis playin' Connect Four\nOur favorite movie just came on the tube and it's ironic it's \"Bloodsport\"\nAnd I'm lookin' at Frank Dux and shit, thinkin' you should split\nBefore Daddy come down these stairs of this basement and see you wasted\nBut he just cut me off like, \"That nigga ain't gon' do shit\"\nBut the truth is this, he couldn't whoop my dad even if he was sober\nI know 'cause he tried once\nEnded up unconscious, a broke arm and a tooth was chipped\nMy big bro got a lot of emotional problems, he feel that we was all abused as kids\nHe saw mama get dragged down all kinds of stairs like a ragdoll when he was two\nAnd this is back when Daddy used to sniff cocaine, poor thang\nHe had to be subjected to this when he gets drunk, he gets to losin' it\nHe gets the illusion that he gon' protect us all from the Big Bad Wolf\nStand up to him and prove some shit\nBut all he really doing is stressin' my mom\nGot her goin', \"Boy, you know your daddy up there asleep\nThe food is ready, why don't you stop\nMaking all this noise and let him stay 'sleep?\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThe turkey's done in the Montgomery home\nDad has just been awakened again (Uh oh)\nGreg is making all kinds of noise\nDaddy's on his way angry again\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"Who is that making all that God damn noise?\" (Not me)\n\"Greggy (Huh?), get up here! You been out there drinking again?\nWhat the fuck I tell you about coming in my house with this disrespectful shit?\nNigga, where the fuck you done been?\"\nI'm thinking to myself \"Greg, please don't say nothin' stupid, man\"\nEvery time my daddy in his drawers and he standing in the hallway\nMad at somebody, I swear to God he got the same strength as Superman (*Sniff*)\nMy brother turned around and just walks in the kitchen\nWithout even givin' an answer with his back to him like, \"I ain't gotta talk to you, nigga\"\n\"Nigga, you don't hear me talkin' to you?\"\nNext thing my brother did is something that when it comes to my father is something you just don't do\nHe looked him right in his eyes and he asked him\n\"What the fuck is you gon' do?\" (Mm, mm, mm)\nMy father hit him so hard his body hit the stove\nThe oven door hit the fucking floor\nThe turkey fell out the oven hole and landed near the stairs\nNow Daddy standin' over Greg talkin' 'bout \"Nigga, you ain't hurt! Get up, get up!\"\nAnd here come Vish' talkin' 'bout, \"Dad, I don't think he gon' get up\"\nThen mama went damn near hysterical (Ahh!)\nShe called the police, the police came\nNeighbors is all in the street\nWatching the cops takin' my father out in handcuffs\nDamn, man that shit was real embarrassin'\nTo all my friends I grew up wit', who grew up fatherless\nI know through me you live vicariously\nI want you to know that we ain't no better than you and yours\nWe all needed therapy\nWe care about each other more\nThan we care about if anybody understands us\nWhat I'm tryin' say is: Fuck you and Happy Holidays from the Montgomery family\n\n[Bridge]\nEvery man reaches that point in life\nWhere he don't want to make excuses no more, more\nLife took me on a roller-coaster ride\nI've been up, I've been down, all the ribbons and my daddy game\nTook me on highs\nTurned around and then took me on lows (This is how the story goes)\nOhh, then I think about it\nI use that shit as fuel\nThen I changed it into\n\n[Chorus]\n(Power), now can't you feel it? (Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it?)\nCan't you feel it? (Can't you feel it?)\nThat I'm a grown man with (Power), yeah (Yeah)\nLet me hear you say \"yeah\" (Yeah)\nIf you was raised in a strict home like me, felt alone like me\nAnd it gave you (Power), ooh\nYou can do it too, just look at me\nSee I'm a grown man with (Power), yeah (Yeah, yeah!), everybody say \"yeah\"\nIf you don't know the meaning of abusive\nYou've been through so much ain't nothin' nobody can do to you\nNow can't you feel it? (Can't you feel it?) I'm a runaway\nThis is how I became, a grown man with (Power)\nOoohh, you can do it too, if I can do it\nUse this (Power), I was a runaway, I was a runaway\nThere ain't nothin' none of you can do to me, do to me\n\n[Outro: Royce Da 5'9\" & Royce's son]\nWhen you were a child growing up with Grandad and Granny\nDid you really feel like Grandad was a good father to you?\nAbsolutely, absolutely\nAll my friend's daddies was walking out on them left and right\nYou know he never left us, he was always there for us\nYou know there were a lot of things that happened that I didn't understand\nMaybe I might not have answered the question the same way when I was a teenager\nBut I understand and appreciate him so much more now as a man\nYou know 'cause he taught me respect and discipline\nAnd consequences for your acts, so yeah, of course\nDo you think his approach as a father\nReally shaped the type of father that you are today\nOr do you in some ways think it had negatives to it?\nAnd if so, what kind of negative traits\nDo you try to avoid having as a father right now, to me?\n(When you have your own, you'll understand)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ece0d83dced13a6ca8fbcbc25cfd032f.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Royce da 5'9'\u2019"}
