Came through the projects\nWhere your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts\nHad to rent that on the dick ass jocking\nRunning through the pussy like a nigga going jogging\nFuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket\nPut a pic with me on the gram now you popping\nWhere your ass was at when I was trapping in the stove?\nHad to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope\nJackie Chan moves got game in the choke\nGas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco\n\n[Hook 2: Future]\n12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope\nBurglar bar doors gotta young nigga confident\nJuugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest\nBlowing on the O ho, we call that ho an onion\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nMan, where your ass was at when we took the city over?\nWhere your ass was at when all they'd ask was what's the hold up?\nWhere your ass was at when niggas first got the news?\nNow your ass around because we\u2019re paying back dues\nWhere were you? When all the dogs needed help\nLawyers and the commissary ain\u2019t gon\u2019 pay itself\nWhere your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?\nWhere your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom\nMan I ain\u2019t got no choice\nCause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy\nI\u2019m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed\nI\u2019ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise\nMan, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn\u2019t feed me?\nWhere your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn\u2019t need me?\nWhere your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?\nFuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders\n\n[Hook 1: Future]\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn\u2019t feed me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when bitches didn\u2019t need me?\nWhere your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?\nWhere your ass was at dog?
