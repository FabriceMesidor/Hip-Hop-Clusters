I hope that you're listening\nThis feel like it's summertime; waiting for the bus\nNumber nine, through the city all alone\nNot a worry, not your phone\nWe just vibing, maybe flying 'round the world\nMan, I hope you see the world\nAnd all your dreams will unfurl\nJust don't never cash your pearl\nGo out there and make a livin', take this advice that I'm givin'\nMake a difference, make a killin', make a killin', Lord willin'\n\n[Chorus]\nLord willin', make a difference\nLord willin', Lord willin'\nI tell 'em, \"Hold on\" (Hold on)\nAnd yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again\nAnd I tell 'em, \"Hold on\" (Hold on)\nI don't understand what's happening\nAnd so I tell 'em, \"Hold on\" (Hold on)\nAnd yeah you know that I gotta bring it back again\nAnd I tell 'em, \"Hold on\" (Hold on)\nI don't understand what's happening\nSo I tell em\u2014", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b9b6844bdd8ebfbe10235ad54d885cfa.960x960x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
