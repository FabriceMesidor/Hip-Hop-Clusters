Don't waste it\"\nThe pain that you had, it was hard to place it\nFor my dad, I couldn't be a replacement\nI yearn for plates with catfish and collard greens\nYou got me into school, off of Mama schemes\nI know I can lean, on you for anything\nAin't have to want for nothing, you my everything\nThey say we don't get to choose our mothers\nSomehow I know our souls chose each other\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nSaint something, please protect this family\nGive cover, from the world's insanities\nI know you got a lot on your plate\nThe stress is on a lot of your faith\nAnd no matter what's coming\nI will be there, I will be there\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nJesus walked across my lawn\nAnd told me you the mom I'm supposed to have\nNobody in my life is as close as that\nIf I'ma write you a song ain't no holdin' back\nNow, I wasn't raised in no cul-de-sac\nYou said, \"Stay in school,\" 'cause you ain't know I rap\nTeachin' me in moments I ain't know was class\nThat's why every girl I go home with be showin' class\nWhen I show my ass, you gave me a whippin'\nThe paradigm shifted and parentin' is different\nBlack woman strength in search of vulnerability\nYou did everything you could and did it willingly\nInstilled in me values of what a child do\nTo say you my Ma, I'm ever so proud to\nYou wrote me letters to get myself better\nI still cherish when we pray together\nThat's a time I really feel the Lord\nI thank you for the your declarations and your vision board\nIt hit a chord, when they rolled you into surgery\nMama, you the sky and earth to me\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nSaint something, please protect this family\nGive cover, from the world's insanities\nI know you got a lot on your plate\nThe stress is on a lot of your faith\nAnd no matter what's coming\nI will be there, I will be there\n\n[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh-oh)\nAh, ah, oh, oh, ah, ah (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nAh, ah, ah, ah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/edcca611de8a88a9ff0e0173cc02f5a7.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Common"}
