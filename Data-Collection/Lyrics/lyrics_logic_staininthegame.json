I think we should come in like this\nYou know what I mean?\nWith that ill beat, sort of give it a different type of vibe\nUh, yeah, we finna get it like this, uh\n\n[Verse]\nSee I'm a stain in the game, tryna scrub me out, I'm still in\nI started at the bottom and now I'm spreading to the ceiling\nIs you feeling this lyrcism, I'm dealing, like rummy, you know?\nMy flow smoother than gin on its way to your tummy\nYeah, I'll stop your heart like a pulmonary edema\nI'm so hungry I need FEMA,  and I used to be a dreamer\n'Til I came into fruition, now, all of y'all better listen\nAnd understand it's my mission, that no matter where I walk\nIt's my purpose to glisten 'cause you rappers can't see me\nLike you bought the wrong prescription, but I spit that Lasik\nSo close, that I can taste it, while you go back to the basis\n'Cause you don't know where you headed, as soon as I shred it\nYou dread it like Wayne's skull\nI'm one of the best, to ever do it, that ain't done it yet\nAnd yes, that might sound cocky\nBut I'm just gunning for your respect, that's how you do it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0f21a1e2589d732e4a263527296e9f51.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
