And you know you're a man\nWherever you go, for the rest of your life\nYou must proooooove, you're a man\n\n[Verse 1: Busta]\nSee now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid\nFrom the front to the back of The Source\nYou see me back on the course\nScream on every beat untill my voice get crackled and horse\nFront seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss\nFuck the fact that it cost, the pricetag of the porche\nWill cost ya life, have ya motha feel an immaculate loss\n*Breath* But of course, come and speak to the best\nAnd watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh\nYou lookin weak in the chest, you see the street is a test\nWomen on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast\nYou see the street is a mess\nStrugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest\nNow I proceed to the rest of my niggas Keepin it fresh\nThough we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress\nWe always seem to finesse from the East to the West\nYou Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest\nKill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess\nGot you under pressure--hairline receaded effects\nHot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath\nRap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press\nAnd as a man I never found the slightest need to impress\nAnother man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed\nBut yo I always found the need to adress these weaker niggas\nThat speak to the street always keepin the people abreast\nNow you've been branded...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Busta]\nHigher science and I'm changin the crime in\nWatch my son cuz you'd be fuckin wit the child of a Giant\nIm in a place stuck between bein lovin and violent, *voice switch*\nBecomin more of a threat when I move subtle and silent\nThen set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot\nMy destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot\nRelate, it's like bustin a 3-8\nBe late, I be takin most of the brick leavin a pile outta shape\nI never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake\nTakin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake\nMake it quick you weak niggas better try to escape\nAnd create the quickest way to reach the fire escape\nSnitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape\nBut it's o-k cuz Super Hero niggas die wit a cape\nIt's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake\nStreet niggas gotta slide for the take//\nBein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak\nStackin my paper so see now I can buy an estate\nSo I rely on the love and I reply to the hate\nSo much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache...come on...\nFrom the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate\nNow I'm straight...got me my OWN knife and fork on my plate\nWanna scorch a debate, wait...do me a favor nigga jus REMEMBER\nThe date...cuz you been...\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cc9251ac994bbe401044c52cb51d1e49.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Busta Rhymes"}
