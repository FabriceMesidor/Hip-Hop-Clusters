Hold your head wherever you at\nOn the flow from the cops with wings on your back\nThat snitch nigga - gave police your location\nWe'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation\nKiller listen, shit ain't the same without you at home\nPhony niggas walk around trying to be your clone\nThey really fear you, when you was at home they was pale\nThat's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail\nBy the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up\nTried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up\nGot caught up in a crime that you can't take back\nReminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac\nYears ago when we was younger\nSeemed the hood took us under very deep\nWondering who snitched it got me losing lots of sleep at night\nYou know my mouth is tight\nI never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right\nSometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack\nDamn - why the situation go down like that?\nIt'll be a long time before the heat dies down\nAnd a - couple of years 'fore we see you around\nBut 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same\nThe cops is grabbing wrong niggas, looking for someone to blame\nThey harrassing, struggling to find the truth\nThere's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof\nTo say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy, deliver\nMe the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river\nMake sure it sinks to the bottom\nOutsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em\nBut still, but still, but still...\n\n[Hook: Crystal Johnson]\nThe temperature's rising, no there's nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising (There's nothing surprising)\n\nThe temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising\nThe temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising\n\n(Surprising)\n*repeat to fade*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a3649b5f1e2e468511c55e488114d523.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mobb Deep"}
