It's Alberta\nThis little boy quickly became a man\nFrom blowing in his father's church, to making his own band\nCalled the Moonglows, sensational with his vocals\nThat drove the ladies crazy, panties got thrown at his shows\nBut he was far from happy, he wore a smile just to hide it\nBehind them doors him and his father constantly colliding\n\n[Hook: Cee Lo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nDestined for greatness, counting his blessings\nYoung'uns struggling with pressures\nThat the fact that his pops was a cross dresser\nBut he still loved him, you know the bond between his son and father\nThat only pushed him and forced him to sing harder\nHis main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car\nBelieved his sound\nAnd took him down to Motown y'all\nThat's where it all happened\nSuccess in the palm of his hand\nBut unfortunate the fame wasn't enough\nHe wanted more out of life\nTook it further and found himself a wife\nPretty Anna Gordy, she made his time sit still\nShe was the cousin of Barry G, the founder of Hitsville\nPlease pay attention because the story it gets ill\nShit's real, trials and tribulations son's facing\nYou gotta play the cards you're dealt\nAin't no telling what life deals\nDeath will cause you to have night chills\nEnough to keep a nigga bothered\nEspecially when the negatives start coming from your father\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Verse 3: Raekwon]\nMoney, women and drugs came into play\nNow wouldn't you know, there goes another happy home down the drain\nThat night life had him speeding through hell\nScarred by the death of Tammi Terrell\nCouldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill\nSecluding himself, from the music and the press\nHe was sick and really getting depressed\nTime passed so he bounced back on track\nNew and improved\nEven got himself a new wife too\nEverything is on the up and up, got his act together\nSpiritually he claims, you could see the glow up on this fella\nTried to make amends with his father\nBut the hatred is too strong, revolver in his palm\nThe warning that death was close\nHis mother screaming out \"Honey don't do it!\"\nOne shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids\nApril 1st he died on the spot the scene was so horrific\nHow a father could kill his own son defines wicked\n\n[Hook: CeeLo Green]\nMarvin, the sound of your voice\nSets fire to my soul\nWhat a glory to behold\nMarvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how\nI just hope you're happy now\n\n[Outro]\nMarvin\nMarvin\nIt's the sound of the music\nMarvin\nMarvin\nMarvin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/626cb7a305bf0b1ac796a18f8df3e29a.820x820x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Raekwon"}
