I don\u2019t know why\u2026\nI\u2019d like to know if you want to get fucked up\nAll I really want to do is stay true. I get high\nI\u2019d like to know if you want to get fucked up\nI\u2019m going to do what the fuck I want to. I don\u2019t know why\u2026\nI\u2019d like to know if you want to get fucked up\nAll I really want to do is stay true. I get high\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe top is old to me. All I\u2019m looking for now is the surface to resurface hood bound\nThe bottoms old to me. All I'm thinking about now is climbing back up midway level out the car is old to me\nThe starts is old to me. This shits old to me. The grips old to me. They say Gotti, you bust grown folks shit\nI'm going to drip and set all my diplomats up they can show the whole world Gotti Barak Obama sick\nI'm more than the average.I'm savage sit. Niggas done broke a lot of branches, twigs and stems\nMe and Das we put together army brigades. Train niggas like silverines green burraes. I'm more like the phantom\nIn and out your hood like phantom in the Phantom. Picture that bitch like candid camera. Nigga this my life. Banging on bustas\nImma bang on these niggas. Pull their eater out and let em feel a nigga. Im gonna keep banging on on bustas\nFucking round with the hoes. Doing everything I supposed to. Nigga keep banging on these bustas\nLeave when I want to leave. Cause niggas always got something up their sleeve\nAnd what?\nAnd they usually begin with a bitch but I'mma jump the bitch out and find a nigga to chip\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNigga, I pour the kit quarter pound mix it up, grind it down - Let me show you how to grind now a days\nShit done changed. But Imma put you up on a legalized dope game. Don't take my word for it. Nigga ask Dr. Dre\nIt's so many different ways to get paid in the vague nigga. Keep bustas out your circle. Passion purple\nThat Memphis is true to half purple so through. I'm just a beast loose in the scrorce. Trips of vibe push force\nI push a ton of at least. Think our lives rely on it. Twoiling and turning on em. Money like serving gas of sherm oil by the clump\nTo see what I might find break niggas. Wake niggas. Make niggas Evacuate their own shit like bush to bush my pipeline\nImma ride high. Real niggas suppose to ride banging on bustas. Imma bang on these niggas\nTore their eater out let em feel a nigga. Imma keep banging on bustas, Fuck around with the hoes\nDoing everything I'm supposed to. Nigga keep banging on bustas. Leave when I want to leave\nCause niggas always got something up their sleeve\nAnd what?\nAnd it usually begin with a bitch but Imma jump the bitch out and find a nigga to chip. That's why...\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nI liked to know if you want to get fucked up\nI liked to know if you want to get fucked up\nI liked to know if you want to get fucked up\nI liked to know if you want to get fucked up\n\n\n[Outro]\nReprise\u2026 Skit\u2026\nMutha fuck that man. Where my shit. Fuck that man!\nI\u2019ll take my car. Come on\nFuck that. We fittin to let these niggas know\nJust pull up. Just pull up\u2026\nGet your shit ready nigga\n(Clocks gun)\nThese niggas right here?\nYUP! That\u2019s them niggas right there\nGet ready. I\u2019m fittin to let these niggas\u2026. Yeah nigga.
