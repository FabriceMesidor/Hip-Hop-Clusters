Leakers\nLogic\nRattpack\nWe gon' jump into these bars\n\n[Verse]\nSo many people think that rap is they calling, stop it just cease\nGot it capiche? This is my house you fuckers just lease\nWaitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest\nBlack and white like a nun\nThese up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn\nSo follow your father like an apostle\nPaint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil\nNever knowing what's gon' follow\nHowever we never wallow in our sorrow\nJust pray for tomorrow\nAt times my heart could be hollow\nEmotions forced to be swallowed\nWhile neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo\nThis is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder\nLife's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you\nSo I'm trying to find her\nOne moment she'll love you then swallow\nYou whole like an anaconda\nThe bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky\nI'mma dominate the world like my name was Brain\nSpit flame like propane\nBitches I overcame you know the name\nInk in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page\nTo numb the pain like novacaine\nYeah\nAllow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic\nMurderin' every demographic\nPaint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic\nRip the mic to set the example\nWhile all these mu-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples\nConstant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die\nSociety expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I\nBut we persevere force feed enemies truth serum\nWe want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased\nIn your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest\nBustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it\nI get from point A to point B by keeping it G\nAin't no killer but don't push me\nIf you grab the heat you a pussy\nKnuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel\nI have not a single enemy\nOnly evil entities that have some how befriended me, In they mind\nCuz I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme\nAnd when it comes to planes I catch dames\nThey catch feelings\nHaters keep my name in they mouth like fillings\nHigh as the ceiling\nYa'll really don't know who your dealing with now\nVisions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen\nThankful for every breath I'm giving\nFuck social division\nThat's how I'm living\nWhat's the deal\nGotta keep it real\nNow tell me how you feel\nIt's Logic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75b9fd3705271c3c10d64dfb3139caf7.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
