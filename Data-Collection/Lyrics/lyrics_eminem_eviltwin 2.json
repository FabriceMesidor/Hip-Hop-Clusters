I feel like I play for the Saints\nI just wanna hurt you\u2014aim for the skanks\nThen aim for all these fake Kanye's\nJay's, Wayne's and the Drake's\nI'm frustrated \u2018cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack\nI'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack\nI'm goin' all out in this rap shit\nAnd whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped\nFor battle, sucka-duck, crawl out the back!\nIt's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools\nFlyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also\nAnd I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full\n\"You done called every woman a slut\nBut you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)\"\nOh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court\nI'll be naked and just wear a law suit\nJudge be like, \"That's sharp\nHow much that motherfucker cost you?\nSmart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you\nAnd jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!\nYou're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'\n\u2018Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo.\"\nEvil twin, take this beat now, it's all you\nI believe people can change, but only for the worse\nI coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse\nSo satanic, K-Mart chains panic\n\u2018Cause they can't even spin back the curse words\n\u2018Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker\nRekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother!)\u2014 Tihs! (Kill your parents!)\nAnd these kids are like parrots\nThey run around the house just like terrorists\nScreamin', \"Fuck! Shit! Fuck!\", adult with a childish-like arrogance\nWild ever since the day I came out, I was like, \"Merits?\nFuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'.\"\nFrom the first album even the gals were like, \"Tight lyrics!\nDreamy eyes!\", but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish\nAnd from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and\nOpposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen\nAnd revisit them old albums often as I can and\nSkim through all them bitches\nTo make sure I keep up with my competition\nHa-ha! Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes\nBorderline genius who's bored of his lines\nAnd that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now\nFeel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies\n\n[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\nThere's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)\nIt controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin\n(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)\nBut he's just a friend (Evil twin), who pops up now and again (Evil twin)\nSo don't blame me (Evil twin), just blame him, it's my evil twin\n(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)\n\n[Interlude]\nWelcome back to the land of the living, my friend\nYou have slept for quite some time\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nSo, who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?\nNah, F with Christina!\nI ain't fuckin' with either, Jessica neither:\nSimpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever\nGet the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or\nExtra Strength Tylenol 3's\nFeel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'\nBedridden and destined never to leave the\nBedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-\nLedger, my suicide notes, barely legible, read the\nBottom, it's signed by the Joker\nLorena said I never can leave her\nShe'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her\nFuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?\nI'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver\nGet them titties cut off, tryin' to mess with a cleaver\nGolly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus\nEver since 19946 Dresden, it was definitely my\nDestiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun\nAt Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore\nI just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors\nFlip burgers and wash dishes\nWhile I wrote rhymes, tryin' to get props for 'em\n\u2018Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em\nThey were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'\nMade them break out the popcorn\nNow I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form\nSince N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows\nLeanin' on the horn, screamin' \"Fuck the police!\" like cop porn\nFlipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn\nFuck top five, bitch, I'm top four\nAnd that includes Biggie and Pac, whore\nAnd I got an evil twin\nSo who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?\nAnd crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him\nAnd I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?\nBut no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)\n(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?\nHi! Faggot! Look who's back\nWith a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there\nTwo rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair\nAnd you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs\nGuess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there\nPeace to Whitney, jeez, it just hit me\nThat I should call the Looney Police to come get me\n\u2018Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth\nI wish someone'd finally admit me\nTo a mental hospital with Britney\nOh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-\n-se Baez couldn't beat this rap\u2014O.J., no\nHooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho\n(Hey-ho!) I sound like I'm tryin' to sing\nThe fuckin' chorus to \"Hip Hop Hooray\"? No\nI\u2019m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-\n8 and I 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so\nLet your low-end raise, yo\nTango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?\nYou tryin' to hold hands with your homie?\nWhat, you think I'm lookin' for romance \u2018cause I'm lonely?\nChange that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me\nHo, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner\nSuperman, try to fuck me over, it won't hurt\nDon't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work\nSo are you, but you're broke \u2018cause you don't work\nBut all bullshit aside, I hit a stride\nStill Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed\nAs it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side\nAnd blamed it on him when they tried to criticize\n\u2018Cause we are the same, bitch!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c354260f9edc6b2e9bf6b06c935a0b8.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
