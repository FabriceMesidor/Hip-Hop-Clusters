Man I made it\nThe flow so juice like concentrated\nBallin' on a budget 'til my ship came in\nNow i'm always on the water like a dorsal fin\nGangsta boo boo, you know the hustler\nAddida[s] and diesel's favorite customer\n\"boy stop\", you know it's paper\nI got an upgrade, like basic cable\nMY words all slured cause my head unstable\nDrugs can't do like Cane and able", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/53acdad1cf4fea4034b787e088b0a07b.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Childish Gambino"}
