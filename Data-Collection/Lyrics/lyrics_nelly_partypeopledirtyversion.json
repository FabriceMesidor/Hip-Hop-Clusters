[Repeat: x8]\nWell it's Fergie I'm the Dutchess comin' straight from California\nStuntin' in my loc locs? Dreamin' bout me M-I-A\nBoyfriend wonderin' where I'm at cause I'm in the spot spot\nWhy he always tryin' to be puttin' me down on lock lock [Repeat: x2]\n\n[Chorus]\n[Nelly]\nVisually waitin' and takin' my time\nWatchin' these haters don't come with they rhymes\nWatchin' these suckers are mimickin', gimmickin' then they start fallin' off one at a time\nYou can go search but you never could find\nI promise you dirty I'm one of a kind\nMold is broken the formulas mine\nI killed the idea and destroyed the design\n\n[Fergie]\nI was patiently waitin' and takin' my time\nNow that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine\nAll of you haters can kiss a behind specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine\nDon't need you to tell me I know that I'm fine\nI'm killin' it baby so call it a crime\nYea you watch it I'm stealin' my time\nI told you before that big girls don't cry\nWhere my party people at?\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8acc2c921ff6defb4a5463597263ff0e.750x750x1.png"}], "artist": "Nelly"}
