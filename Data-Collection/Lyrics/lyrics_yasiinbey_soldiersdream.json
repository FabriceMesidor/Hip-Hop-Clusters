I think a lot of people get that\nIt\u2019s like when you experience something and uh, it affects you for a long time afterwards\nI guess everything works that way. Certain things have more impact than others\nSometimes it visits you in your dreams or when you\u2019re quiet or just at peace or trying to be at peace\nA lot of soldiers get it. A lot of common people get it\nMost of the time common people are soldiers, that\u2019s just the way it works out\nThis is a soldier\u2019s dream\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nThe other night\nI was tumbling towards an uneasy sleep\nWhere I had discovered myself\nAtop the sweet sticky firmament of my dreams\nDaybreak came and discovered me\nWith my fantasies pasted to my face\n\nI can't look at you right now\n\"Show me your eyes,\" she says\n\"Later,\" he says\n\"Now, now.\"\n\"NO!\"\n\nShame is a prison you know\nYeah, well discretion is a fortress\nYou\u2019re staring and looking too closely\nThere\u2019s so much about me that I hide\nThat careful eyes will recognize\nIf you look closely you\u2019ll notice\nThat the pattern on this soft broadcloth shirt\nIs made of\nWorking man's blood\nAnd praying folk\u2019s tears\nIf you look closer, you\u2019ll notice that\nThis pattern resembles\nTenement row houses, project highrises\nCell block tiers\nDiscontinued stretches of elevated train tracks\nSlave ship gullies, acres of tombstones\nIf you look closer, you\u2019ll notice\nThat this fabric has been carefully blended\nWith an advanced new age polymer (oh man, that\u2019s nice)\nTo make the fabric lightweight\nWeatherproof, and durable\nAll this\nTo give some sort of posture and dignity\nTo a broken body that is a host for scars\nI am the new landmark\nI am the museum of injury\nSoldiers visit me and admire me quietly\nWhispering among themselves\nYou\u2019re no soldier\nYour soft bright eyes never have to\nSurvey the battlefield\nMuch less its collected relics of which, I am one\nSo, my flesh bullet-ridden remains hidden\nUnderneath these soft fabrics\nWhich I carefully select\nThat stand in for how I used to feel\nFor how I remember feeling\nFor how I dream about feeling\nFor how I feel about you\nAnd now your curious fingers want to search\nBeyond this tender armor\nI can't look at you right now\n\nThis is my rifle\nThere are many like it\nBut this one is mine\n2x\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour eyes are too careful\nCollecting it all arranging it all;\nSurgically, robotically, exactly\nI can\u2019t look at you right now\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter because\nYou can look at me and the longer that\nI don\u2019t return your gaze\nThe harder that your gaze\nStarts to run across my back\nLike a nervous policeman\u2019s hands:\nBrisk, intent, anxious for discovery\nIf discretion is a fortress\nThen you\u2019re threatening to destroy it\nBy simply\nStanding at the gates\nAnd refusing to leave\nI can\u2019t look at you right now\nBut you can look at me\nDo you see me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4d1a9757d430776710118a3e0ba4658f.1000x667x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yasiin Bey"}
