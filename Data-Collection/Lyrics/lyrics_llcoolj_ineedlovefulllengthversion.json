I need love bad\nI got money, but love is something I never had\nI need your ruby red lips sweet face and all\nI love you more than a man who's ten feet tall\nI'd watch the sunrise in your eyes\nWe're so in love when we hug, we become paralyzed\nOur bodies explode in ectasy unreal\nYou're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel\nIt's like a dream-land I can't lie, I've never been there\nMaybe this is an experience that me and you can share\nClean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet\nI swear to you this is something I'll never forget\n\nI need love\n\nSee what I mean I've changed I'm no longer\nA playboy on the run I need something that's stronger\nFriendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration\nThis whole experience has been such a revelation\nIt taught me love and how to be a real man\nTo always be considerate and do all I can\nProtect you, you're my lady and you mean so much\nMy body tingles all over from the slightest touch\nOf your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time\n'till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine\nIf I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man\nI'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands\nI can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive\nI gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive\nI'll search the whole world for that special girl\nWhen I finally found you, watch our love unfurl\n\nI need love\n\nLL Talking:\nGirl, listen to me\nWhen I be sitting in my room all alone\nStaring at the wall\nFantasies, they go through my mind and I've come to realize\nThat I need true love and if you wanna give it to me girl\nMake yourself seen I'll be waiting\n\nI love you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9e00cf56336ec8915e2fa3b2b2e7502d.377x377x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
