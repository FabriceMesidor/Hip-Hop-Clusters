Oh well\"\nMy past behind me like a pony tail\n\n[Hook]\nBut you my right hand, you my go to\nTold me everything about you\nThat's a bold move\nI know that you're out here\nAnd there's things you gotta go through\nJust know that these streets just don't love you like I do\nAnd they never will\n\n[Verse 2]\nOkay I know you want the Audi\nI know you want to go to Maui\nYou and all your girlfriends\nThe ones you never bring around me\nCause you don't trust me like your last man\nDid he open doors for ya?\nBuy the things you can't afford for ya\nCause he must have did a lot for ya\nI just fell back with it\nAnd now your past is behind you\nLike the car with the strap in it\nThank god that's finished\nCause now it's back to business\nAny more Henny and you're past the limit\nYou told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it\nI would never put you on blast when I get it\n\n[Hook]\nYou my right hand, you my go to\nTold me everything about you\nThat's a bold move\nI know that you're out here\nAnd there's things you gotta go through\nJust know that these streets just don't love you like I do\nAnd they never will\nYou my right hand, you my go to\nTold me everything about you\nThat's a bold move\nI know that you're out here\nAnd there's things you gotta go through\nJust know that these streets just don't love you like I do\nAnd they never will", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a1fbdbed436371e137065c2ea4a82448.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
