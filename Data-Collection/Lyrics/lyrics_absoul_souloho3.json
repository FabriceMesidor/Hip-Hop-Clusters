I am\n'Cause it's all about control, and I've got lots of it\n\n[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]\nSoulo ho, the one and only\nYou niggas know me, your bitches want me\nDetermination, I got a grip\n9-5 locs, I am not a Crip\nBlood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers\nYour short-term tall tales won't sell here\nAnd Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here\nLet me get a \"hell yeah\"\n\n[Hook: (Jhen\u00e9 Aiko) & Ab-Soul]\n(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is\n(It's about that time) Soulo on one again\n(It's been a hell of a ride) You niggas know what it is\n(We live one hell of a life) Say Soulo on one again\nI'm still on my shit\nFuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, they still on my dick\nYou niggas know what it is\n(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is\n(It's about that time) Soulo on one again\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nYeah, manipulatin' minds\nReciprocatin' time spent on my amazin' rise\nSaid I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon\nWe can see you half-steppin', I should somersault\nSome are salty that I made it in the way I did\n'Cause I really did everything I say I did\nLet me tell you why I'm vexed\nThe same reason why I'm stressed\nThe same reason why I'm blessed\nI stopped prayin' and I started plannin'\nI stopped playin' and I made it happen\nWe mapped it out and now the map is ours\nRaised my stats all from records, check an almanac\nThank God, Punchline knew I had a knack\nDown to die to get my point across like craps\nControl System, cut off your radios, cut off your television\n\n[Hook: (Jhen\u00e9 Aiko) & Ab-Soul]\n(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is\n(It's about that time) Soulo on one again\n(It's been a hell of a ride) You niggas know what it is\n(We live one hell of a life) Say Soulo on one again\nI'm still on my shit\nFuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, they still on my dick\nYou niggas know what it is\n(Open your eyes) You niggas know what it is\n(It's about that time) Soulo on one again\n\n[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]\nTruth, I'm turnin' their heads and I'm earnin' respect\nGrinnin' 'cause niggas ain't know I was next\nPinnin' this shit in the wind, literate as Oscar Wilde\nBringin' the terror and tearin' the concert down\nThe spliff will get lit up 'til we look like we come from Chinatown\nMissin' Alori Joh, it's been a minute since I saw her smile\nShe's the reason why I go as hard as I do now\nFuck a foe 'cause I'm focused as four bifocals\nI'm prone to leave a vocal booth totaled for the right total\nThe bad boy, you boys pussy as Total\nOr Dorothy's dog Toto, I'm tellin' niggas\nI'ma need a few wings like Frodo, I can't say YOLO\nBecause I've been here before, so def that I've been reborn, Soulo\n\n[Outro: (Jhen\u00e9 Aiko) & Ab-Soul]\n(Open your eyes) I know you can see me\n(It's about that time) They ain't goin' believe me\n(It's been a hell of a ride) Nothin' was given\n(We live one hell of a life) We still livin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/36147c3e9b6fcfa747233bb1c340f424.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
