It's like funny I mack legit and make all the money See my\nCapital T on my diamond ring He hooked up the beat and loves to swing So while\nYa out there grooving back and forth I wants ya to scream out Sir Too $hort\n\nDon't stop that rap! (Don't stop that rap!) And it's just like that, get busy\nGirls, while I rap I make big money, that ain't no crap When I grab that mic\nAnd spit my rhyme I gotta have an 8 or 909 (beat!) So I can rock ya all night\nLong (She's!) on my tip, she loves my song (He!) tried to do it but did it\nWrong (Freaks!) wanna get me all alone but I'm macking Hit it! I finally got\nThe chance to grab my pen And make another rhyme so I can make more ends It's a\nRushed production, not the beat I rushed out the studio and hit the streets Now\nI'm rocking one more time Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme But that big fat\nGirl better let that go Before I point right at her and say hoe! I'm driving a\nDrop top Caddy, I don't dig fake I step on the gas, then I hit the break Do it\nAgain as I catch the beat Ya feeling that bass all down the street Jumped off\nThe car in 9-0 I was wearing all white Capisque Had my 501's, five dunkie rolls\nCouldn't be saved by John The Pope The M-A-C and K from Oakland, Califoniyee I'\nM Too $hort baby, no, I don't play Freak nasty, I like ya dance Ya know it\nLooks good in those pants So damn good I had to lance Now I'm macking See\nThis gold?
