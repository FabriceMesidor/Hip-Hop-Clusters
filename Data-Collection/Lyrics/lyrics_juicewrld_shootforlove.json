Here I come\nI done put my heart on the rocks so don't run\nI done put my name on a bullet in my gun\nI'ma shoot for love\nBaby, are you ready or not? Here I come\nI done put my heart in this song so don't run\nGot my name in a bullet in my gun\nI'ma shoot for love\n\n[Bridge]\nRun babe, go and hide babe, just don't fall in in love\nRun babe, go hide babe, just don't fall for love, in love\n\nAre you ready or not? Here I come\nI done put my heart on the rocks so don't run\nI done put my name on a bullet in my gun\nI'ma shoot for love\nBaby, are you ready or not? Here I come\nI done put my heart in this song so don't run\nGot my name in a bullet in my gun\nI'ma shoot for love\nShoot for love\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a gun in my hand\nWe can run up them bands, love\nPop me a Xan, on our way to France, love\nGun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love\nShoot for love\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done\nI done had enough of the pain, its not fun\nGot my name in a bullet in my gun\nI'ma kill for love\nDon't care if you're ready or not, 'cause I'm done\nI done had enough of the pain, its not fun\nGot my name in a bullet in my gun\nI'ma kill for love\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a gun in my hand, we can run up them bands, love\nPop me a Xan, on our way to France, love\nGun in my hand\nWe can run up them bands, love\nShoot for love, shoot for love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ff8ab8d3ae5bb47f0797a87d42ddf66.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Juice WRLD"}
