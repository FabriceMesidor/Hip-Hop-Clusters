(college girl)\nAnd you sweet too\nI would introduce you to my sweet tooth\nBut I ain\u2019t come here all the way across the world to personally meet you\nAnd I hope you don't get offended\nI'm in another state of mind right now\nAnd I hope you understand I'm on my grind right now\nMy vision like a tunnel\nStandin' in the jungle\nI want to touch your heart but it's music every single summer\nI wish you was my home girl\nI miss my motherfuckin' uncle\nYou wanna see this shit more than me nigga\nI'mma be all I can be nigga!\n\n[Hook]\nIf you love me, love me unconditional\nPatience is a virtue then come residuals\nThese be the realest words I ever said\nThese be the realest words I ever said\nI'mma try to get to know you, not your physical\nGotta a bad habit and you scared to let it go\nThese be realest words I ever said\nThese be the realest words I ever said", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7317e7abac3ca19d05f474a34f3a8dce.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Future"}
