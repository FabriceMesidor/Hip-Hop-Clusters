Sho Lia wicked like Fangoria\nFool is hatin cause he don't understand my communication, Nokia\nTecca N9na spit it so clear like Ho sheer\nWhen I get to rippin this flow here\nAll the women go ta grabbin their crotch they all screamin OH DEAR!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah, I think they got me fucked up\nEverybody better hold up\nCause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me\nAnd I think I'm the answer\n\n[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]\nArmed and dangerous\nKali baby, y'all can never hang with us\nY'all strange to us\nY'all niggas be gambling or rambling\nCount another mil', it's chump change to us\nI'm joking\nIf I'm N9ne I keep that pistol smoking\nBy design to find your prime time if their eyes open\nSign of the times ain't dependent on the rhymes\nQuoted rockabye to smoking on the pipe but doing lines of cocaine\nI don't rock that shit\nI'ma drop that dime like they committed to crime on divine lines that I've spoken\nSo get up if you can get the picture\nOnly hurt ya if the shoe fits ya\nI really can't stay on my time zone\nI ain't user friendly word to iPhone\nA different creature, every feature I get on is my song\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nWell I, Well I know you got me fucked up\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, better hold up\nSee they don't be feeling you like they feeling me\nAnd I know I'm that answer\n\n[Verse 4: Godemis]\nToo old for this bullshit\nZoned out, turned up\nThe gross must pass through fire and that's why\nI'm burned up\nHell all in my head, peace (Got a)\nGapin' hole in my heart too (But I)\nWon't pray to no savior (Why?)\nThese days I'm too smart too\nI ain't came up for no air yet\nI put dough down on a fare bet\nNiggas hood rich, I ain't there yet\nBut I got holes like a clarinet\nAnd I chug lean and I pop pills\nAnd they hate Dean 'cause I got skills\nIf these pussies don't shoot me, you can bet that the punk cops will\nI give two shits about who's with you\nLaugh loud when that boom hit you\nOn the role, like I'm too cripple\nGetting twisted like two nipples\nMy soul's darker than nightride but no night light, I write all day\nI get busy with them blades in, and leave blood stains in the hallway\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah, I think they got me fucked up\nEverybody better hold up\nCause they don't be feeling you like they feelin' me\nAnd I think I'm the answer\n\n[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]\nWatch out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/72d0fa945fac97a83eaac6fac8a734b5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
