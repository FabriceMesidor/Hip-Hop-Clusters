Come here\nPut your ear up to the speaker, dear\nWhile I freak this world premiere\nSeducin' her, loosen up\nWith a little freestyle that'll\u2014 wait, am I losin' ya?\nAm I makin' you look bad? Well, I got news for ya\nHomie, you losin' her\nOh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast\nAm I tryin' to show how? Let me slow it down some\nIt's still gonna be a blow-out\nYou're gonna wanna throw out your whole album\nRummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin' to see\nIf you can save any of it, punk, but none of it's fuckin' with me\nPrick, you really feelin' that bullshit?\nYou think you killin' them syllables? Quit\nPlayin', these beats ain't nothin' to fool with\nThey call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down\nYour entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round\nI am also the opposite of what you are like\nYou're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic\nI am awesome and you are just awe-struck\nShe's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck\nFrom suckin' my dick... aw, fuck\n\n[Chorus: Eminem & Sly Jordan]\nSeduction, seduce\nAin't nobody who's as good at what I do\n(It's like a verbal seduction when)\n'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't\nShe's been stolen from you\n(It's like a verbal seduction when)\nSeduction, seduce\nAin't nobody who's as good at what I do\n'Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't\nShe's been stolen from you\n(It's like a verbal seduction when)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7b93181ae4ed594c902bf7e4e2149ca7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
