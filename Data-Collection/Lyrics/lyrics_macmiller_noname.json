{"songs": [{"title": "No Name", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "I just ain't gotta see these sad people who got raised up with that means\nMost empty hands on the wheels, warmin up by the fears they on ride through the hills\nFuck around once on a high slope and I gone hear them cry life's a flop\nI know people aimin high makin plans to get this money on to grow\nNot even sitting they playin games betting that they will get this hoe\nSay they master of their life until that they're broke\nThen seein life as a hole diggin till touch on some gold\nBut I ain't wanna spend a whole life in a hole\nImma build and stand tall on my lands, live it by my own laws\nGot two boats people rent, damn business for my time, guess who's fuckin director\nI'm improvin once the chance there, my mind workin like a detector\nGot my whole future in the hands, hope enough time to make it\nNow I stop this pimpin I'm comin back to ya, not sure that I gave ya enough hits, yeah bitch\nGettin prepared for a post life, chekin out some LV pants\nAskin yourself if it will fit, tryna make a complete plan\nBut you distract from the matter, you gon fall off the bridge\nYou feelin weak, you can't see end of the road, no wonder, no lane switch\nRiches gonna be rich and poor gonna be poor\nAin't gotta work low if you wanna turn a\nRuined nigga into a nigga that merit dollars more\nHold the soul far from all wrong thoughts\nMake a pure living without influence cause the smallest fault\nCould be the biggest fall\n\nHook:\nNigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit\nNo tags featuring my name, no headlines, I'm no name, It's self made shit\nIt's heart made, I'm beatin hard to bring head minds on light\nDon't need no expensive shit\nIt's not a name who'll recover the fund of my art, the pain way deeper in the heart\nIt's bleedin out the pen and shit\n\nVerse 2:\nNo shit no shit, I'd feel good the way everybody look at me\nVIP shit, get through each door like I'm portunes holy keys\nGot money to control, vices aren't consuming free\nI know youths gettin faded and shaded and then hope that they'll make it\nAnd cursin their future family tree by plantin these seeds\nSay I'm too valuable of my life to get this weed\nAnd say I should be yelling through the plains but I feel\nHow the system faked me born me with a silver spoon in the hands and greed\nFated to show my will, now they all see the bill\nNow they want ball but spill over their mentality of mill\nI know people grindin hard blaming me\nFor not being thankful, say I'm high and chill\nWhy the fuck feel I like my life ain't filled ?\nDo I yet consider what I have or am I high on a trip ?\nIs it my style or it's surroundings who're ill?\nHuman being diverse like a zoo but everyone still want it in his grill\nI would put my enemies on a grill, swearin if the stake be there they would get evils\nAnd it hurts to know that's the supposed company we live with\nWhen everybody look at you, maybe McQueen shirts'll cover you\nBut one day, you'll have to tell the truth, to proof to the world you ain't no fool\nPray the angels grant a panda fur coat for a cold love\nAt least two bank accounts for my ladies, your job to spend it\nScopes turned towards me, complexion skills are lean\nPeople sucking dick for piece of my kind, nothing of the shit is real\nI just guess I'm too valuable of my life too live it free\nBlue, white and red three questions mark an ethnicity and a riddle for me\n\nHook:\nNigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit\nNo tags featuring my name, no headlines, I'm no name, It's self made shit\nIt's heart made, I'm beatin hard to bring head minds on light\nDon't need no expensive shit\nIt's not a name who'll recover the fund of my art, the pain way deeper in the heart\nIt's bleedin out the pen and shit\n\nVerse 3:\nClaim it's my first first rap but my bars deeper you ever would expect\nLife on a line but you blinded by the masses, only tryna follow fashions\nBusy by your dope life, no time to be wise, I know you never had this education\nAnyway it not seems in range of your imagination\nDon't worry I'll give to ya, just lay back to your elations listening to my phrases\nA quiet nap implicates a dozen of benzos\nCouples of xanies because the pressure keeps holding me on\nI know that's what they sippin when they call it a living and my finger is 'bout to make a killing\nIf they ask where I'm at, answer is I'm writin this, I just followed my instinct, that's the way it is\nI didn't follow how the problems was pilin, though I could solve them peelin off and takin pills in\nMuch history in the tree I'm from, the mark ain't no scar, you don't know my sore\nI 'member five years when my mom was poppin bottles on every friday\nTen years later we still not seen the payday\nHer pain was her man, father's psychotic behavior'll never get away\nLord did life hard but lord did right cause now I'm here to tell her bad plays\nI don't fault her, she's only human, I forgive, I know better days are on the way\nGet in my shoes for a week and you'll stumble\nI really don't like this style of being not humble\nIf you don't see through my eyes the tears that are stuck\nYou are danger for me, I just gotta keep duck\n\nHook:\nNigga don't hang around, I like them niggas doin independent shit\nNo tags featuring my name, no headlines, I'm no name, It's self made shit\nIt's heart made, I'm beatin hard to bring head minds on light\nDon't need no expensive shit\nIt's not a name who'll recover the fund of my art, the pain way deeper in the heart\nIt's bleedin out the pen and shit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/70b2ca5e1882a2f184d45a2e6ccb37eb.916x916x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
