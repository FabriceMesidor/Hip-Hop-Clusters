You know shit is rough after you slid\nYou in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid\nAin't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit\nWe used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest\nFor every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out\nMachine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts\nYou came to my hood, we was broke\nI wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?\nStill on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so\n'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto\nBut fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones\nPeace to your daughter and your newborn son\nIt used to be fun, makin' records to see your response\nBut, now competition is none, now that you're gone\nAnd these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain\nAnd they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that\nIt's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you\nJoke with you, happy we on top, the most official\nAin't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're\nCapable to take it where you took it to\nI missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake\n'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way\nI woulda stayed so long with so much to say\nI had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'\nTellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side\nBut I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by\nYou can't kill nothin' that's Ready to Die\nYou was like God to us in the form of Allah\n\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n[Chorus]\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\n[Verse 2]\n(Thug Life never die..)\nDear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop\nAnd use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out a Lil' Liquor\nYou was more than just the wildest nigga\n2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga\nIt's goin on the third year, since you've been gone\nOn the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on\nThe industry be talkin', offendin' me often\nThey don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin\nI can relate, shootouts and court dates\nAll Eyez on You, niggas in your face invadin' your space\nYou asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?\nHow long would I ride before I fold up?\nHow did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?\nYou predicted it in every line, all in your flow\nThere could Never Be Peace I have to quote\nCan't believe I heard my name on \"the realest shit you ever wrote\"\nWe had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top\nBut kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped\nIn NYC, at MTV, people watched\nWe was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep\nThink about how us real niggas would be\nIf we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?\nYou was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified\nLike the son of God, when Lucifer lied\nAnd make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?\nBut Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link\nWill there ever be another MC as nice?\nWill you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?\n\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n[Chorus]\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?\nDid Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?\nWhat has Al Green seen, that made him religious?\nWas it the drugs, put an end to the music business?\nIf so, should I put out the indo right now and write down\nA plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around\n'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream\nI'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens\nIt be the ones you always knew, that want it on\nTellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on\nThought we walked a million miles it was just twenty\nNot used to walkin' in the path of legit money\nI thought I made it but we only took baby steps\nUp the success ladder, where they pay me checks\nTo my clicks when I got it I said \"Baby bless\"\nThat was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess\nWe in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good\nHip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would\nA lot of ups and downs in the game\nCould lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain\nOne day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out\nSome is 'bout it, most individuals plots\nAnd run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves\nWhile others have no cares and stay in jail\nMore than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest\nThrough the head, through the gut it shows\nThe future for us young shooters and old killers\nWho become rich as dope dealers?\nNothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments\nThug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap\nWe want the fast way out of this trap\nWhether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack\nTo my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back\nBut life is a dream and y'all taught me that\n\n[Kenny Loggins sample]\n.. always survive.. but why?\n\n[Outro]\nAlways survive, always\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my niggas just stay alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73b36e02ac974c8ab4a3cd49a9cf1794.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
