{"songs": [{"title": "Wild Wild West", "album": "Players", "year": null, "lyrics": "[$hort]\nOnce upon a time there lived a man\nIn a place that's known as East Oakland\nHe can rap to the beat like all the rest\nSo rough hanging tough in the wild wild west\nWith his gangsta waves and gangsta hoods\nHe made friends with dealers and crooks\nAnd when the party was on you knew he had come\nIt is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones\nWalking right up to the dj man\nAnd give another emcee's rap\nCuz they knew about him and his gangsta rap\nThe fact they just couldn't manage that\nHe was known around to be the best\nSo rough hanging tough in the wild wild west\nIn a land where whips will watch the car\nTell you everything and they still want more\nWhere life is only give and take\nIn a land where the strong control the fake\nHe was known around for all the time\nEverybody went wild when he said his rhyme\nSaid things that would never been thought out\nWith his gangsta ride his turned that town so out\nLike Jesse James in a land\nWhere game that controls the lane\nYes the wild wild west that's the place\nSuckers take a bite and don't even taste\nThe California lifestyle that I live\nWhen the sun rolls out every chance it get\nThe wild wild west that's where you see\nEmcee rappers make you look like weak\nCuz you would never hang in the wild wild west\nWithout your six-shooter and your bulletproof vest\nYou can get down but I don't know where\nYou come out here you better act square\nCuz we don't play don't come my way\nWhen you sucker wanna front you'll hear me say\n\"Front me\" 'cuz you'll front yourself\nI'll leave you standing there mad as hell\nYou can rap your best that's what you do\nBut you just can't hang and you know its true\nLike a homeboy said its one two three\nWest coast raps straight to the beat\nYou got have a lot of game to spit that rap\nI wanna put a little game to you just like that\nToo $hort I thought you knew\nYou can't count three and then skip two\nIt just won't work but you might try\nTo front a emcee from Seventy Five\n\nGirls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh\nEmcee rap through the wild wild west\nMaking you look weak cuz we don't play\nAll you sucker emcee's do you hear me say\nFront me... front me...\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a man\nIn a place that's known as East Oakland\nHe can rap to the beat like all the rest\nSo rough hanging tough in the wild wild west\nWith his non-stop rapping and his west coast style\nHe had the whole damn party just going wild\nSinging rhymes all time back to back\nTurning every party out with the west coast rap\nThat's when the sucker emcees all came to be\nNothing but everyday sucker emcee's\nThey were all his friends all his fans\nWalk right up and shake his hand\nAnd you always knew everytime\nSucker emcee's wish they could rhyme\nJust like pimp but what's the fact\nThe fact they just couldn't hang with that\nThey were all frustrated, all rapped out\nDidn't even know what to rap about\nHomeboys, do you agree\nAin't nothing worth kicking like a sucker emcee\nCuz much come fresh and all sound bad\nSucker emcee's couldn't make him mad\nWith a rap like his, a rap like that\nThere never was time for a sucker to rap\nThe sucker emcee would just wait his turn\nSucker emcee's don't wanted to get burned\nWhat emcee knew the play\nHe had the sucker emcee's all running away\nDidn't want none you couldn't bring them back\nThey never could deal with a real big mack\nOne emcee was the best\nSo rough hanging tough in the wild wild west\nThere was one emcee who knew the tip\nAnd the sucker emcees don't even trip\nSo tell it to the world it's not too wise\nTo front an emcee from Seventy Five\n\nGirls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh\nEmcee rap through the wild wild west\nMaking you look weak cuz we don't play\nSucker emcee's do you hear me say\nFront me... front me...\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a man\nIn a place that's known as East Oakland\nHe can rap to the beat like all the rest\nSo rough hanging tough in the wild wild west\nJust a true emcee didn't pass the test\nSinging raps like this all rated X\nHanging like a champ with a heavyweight rap\nNo emcee could rock like that\nThen the boy got paid again and again\nSaying he wouldn't stop till he got a Benz\nI never thought about it till the other day\nHe had top drop rolling away\nIn a eighty five or eighty six\nSaid he got paid cuz he rapped like this\nYou could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars\nShoes, [?] and caviars\nJust checking out the girls walking down the street\nIn the wild wild west that's where you see\nThe freshest emcees you will say is soft\nFrom Seventy Five Girls so raw\nLike Silky C and hollywood\nThey come so fresh cuz you know they could\nLike sir Too $hort when I'm on the mic\nWest coast rappers rap all damn night\nSo watch how you talk in the wild wild west\nEast coast rappers make us look fresh\nWith the \"say ho and everybody scream\"\nEast coast rappers make all the green\nWith a New York rap and a New York slang\nNot too many could spit that game\nNow the time has come and I'll tell it right\nAbout a rapper like me who will rock the mic\nI'm trying to wake you up on the western coast\nWere giving you more than just the most\nIts everything you could never have\nYou can spend your money and buy my rap\nThe wild wild west that's what its called\nAbout the west coast rappers that stand so tall\nThe freshest emcees you'll say you saw\nFrom Seventy Five Girls, so raw\nWild wild west", "image":
