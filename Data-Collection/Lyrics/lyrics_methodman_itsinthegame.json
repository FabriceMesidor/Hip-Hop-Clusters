Huh?\nYou know\nHuh?\nIt's like, you don't limit yourself to one thing\nYour mama\nGot to broaden your horizons\nBroaden your joints\nKeep your eyes on the prize\nThe struggle goes on\nEryday (ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)\nEryday\nAnd I'ma live it through my music\n(ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)\nYou know how we do\nChoose or lose from it\n\nVerse One: Method Man\n\nPull your shoes up, don't get stuck\nOr get your frame struck, when my squad blitzin\nHittin like Mack trucks, head splittin paper written\nIn windy cities like Chicago, no bullshhhh\nYou see me spittin at the kitten with the lost mitten\nAs we engage in cold war gettin frostbitten\nOnce again up in these stank drawers baby listen\nOne mind and for one cause, heavy hittin\nThe penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus\nIn pursuit of gold lines, can a n---a touch it\nIf I can't see ya can't truss it\nA shady character like Buzz Buzzard\nLay him out like a plush rug-ged\n*mimicking Brand Nubian* Now you can love it, or leave it alone\nWe drink death and puff bone\nDraggin your body out the end zone\nAnd any way the wind blow that's where you flow\nThat's why you be the first one caught, last to know\nBody layin out on the flo', substitute\nHeavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'\nThird and long, quarterback pack the cannon on\nI go deep he drop bombs, *whistle* that's when I touch-down\nSix points, what now?\nOnce again who comin through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous\nEver since I came with this, and wrecked a body\nYou convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous\nOffensive shotgun\nCalm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun\nDeep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son\nYou win some you lose some, it's in the game\n\nYou win some you lose some (uhh!) that's how it goes son (yeah)\nYou win some you lose some (uhh!) it's in the game ... (yeah)\nYou win some you lose some, that's how it goes son\nYou win some you lose some, it's in the game\n\nVerse Two: Ricky Watters\n\nFrom the football field\n(It's in the game\nYou win some you lose some, it's in the game)\nTo the mountain, yaknowhatI'msayin?\n(That's how it goes son, that's how it goes\nYou win some you lose some, it's in the game)\n\nFreestylin, profilin, won't catch me smilin\nStraight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin\nA funky type of style with the lyrical incision\nS--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison\nGood riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack\nSippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track\nYo bring it back, or make it hit harder\nInfiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter\nSo drop harder, if you wanna conjugate\nVerbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound\nIn your earpiece I'm the beast\nTo say the least, we must increase, the peace\nBut keep it real, so I can feel, the skills\nFunky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill\nAnd thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips\nDoin backflips, it's another hit\nCome take a sip, of the running Watters\nLyrically I slaughter, mentally I author\nThe rhymes that you feel to the map\nCrushin double barrels, sing em out like carols\nWho it be?  It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes\nFrom NY, city we committee we gets busy\nWith killa beez on the swarm\nLyrically we storm, mentally a lord\nVerbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill\nIt's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile\nDrillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff\nAnother TV, and they loved it\n\n(You win some you lose some, that's how it go son\nYou win some you lose some, that's in the game\nYou win some you lose some, that's how it go son\nYou win some you lose some, that's in the game\nIt's in the game\nYou win some you lose some, it's in the game\nIt's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fe6629f7a5e6af0aa38ca87547ced96f.1000x562x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Method Man"}
