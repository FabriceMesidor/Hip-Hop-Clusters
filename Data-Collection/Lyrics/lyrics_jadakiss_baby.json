Uhh\nWhen Feds came in, they've had enough, it's bad enough\nIt ain't even drugs, it's bodies that they bagging up\nWatch out, if you shoot a nigga then they gon' stab 'em up\nBig difference between a savage and a scavenger\nCrazy 'cause I'm sitting on green, puffing the lavender\nEverybody busts with the coupe, I pull a wagon up\nFor some reason the money and love just ain't adding up\nI tend to appreciate it more if you had it rough\nDollar and a dream but niggas ain't even got a buck\nSo they start looking for help 'cause they out of luck\nStand tall til them shots fly, then you gotta duck\nGot a high shooting percentage then you ain't gotta chuck\nBack at the squad car dying to get out the cuffs\nYou know when you brandish the iron, then you gotta bust\nPlastic or chrome, no doubt my (Baby)\nI don't leave home without my (Baby), uh, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Dyce Payne]\nI'm still a shooter at the dice game, YEAH\nHoodie season with the ice chain, YEAH\nI pull up in that white thing, YEAH\nPerico, my license plate say cocaine, yeah\nWhippin' up work with the propane (whip it) YEAH\nBitches on my head like Rogaine, YEAH\nI cradle my piece my (Baby)\nBeen in the streets ever since I was a (Baby)\n\n[Verse 2: Jadakiss]\nHA-HAAAEEH! Uhh\nThis all facts, you just gotta check the proof that's there\nLook at the stash, you just gotta check the loot that's there\nWhen it's a war, you accountable for troops that's there\nI made a quarter million dollars off of fruit last year\nThe old heads don't give a fuck, it's the youth that care\nThey standing by the tree but they don't see the noose that's there\nThey telling lies to our vision tryna boost our fear\nI get my hands on a gallon of that juice, I swear\nEvery time that a nigga threw a deuce, I squared\nFind every auxiliary and Bluetooth I paired\nAll the truth I share, every booth I aired\nSometimes I go over their heads so I lose my peers\nWork out and eat right so I don't lose no years\nBut I don't feel no remorse so I don't use no tears\nJust a MAC-11, trey pound seven my (Baby)\nYeah, AK or the Desert my (Baby), what?!\n\n[Chorus: Dyce Payne]\nI'm still a shooter at the dice game, YEAH\nHoodie season with the ice chain, YEAH\nI pull up in that white thing, YEAH\nPerico, my license plate say cocaine, yeah\nWhippin up work with the propane YEAH\nBitches on my head like Rogaine\nI cradle my piece my (Baby)\nBeen in the streets ever since I was a (Baby)\n\n[Outro: Jadakiss]\nHA-HAAAEEH!", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/dd3db271ac24fda585226f280b33e5b9.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jadakiss"}
