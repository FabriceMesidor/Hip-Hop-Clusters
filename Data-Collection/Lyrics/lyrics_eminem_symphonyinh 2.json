Got an Oscar but I'm still a grouch\nI use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch\nYelawolf, Shady, Tony-Touch, Slaughterhouse\nYeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out\nGo to hell in a drought, break ice waters out\nNice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store\nBut Christ for that price coulda bought a house\nBesides only thing I ever had iced out was my heart since I started out\nIt\u2019s F.Y.I, if ya ain't knowing\nWhat, go with you? Where? Nah, ain't going\nOh wait, you wanna date? Oh, well in that case ho, it's June 8th, oh!\nAnd kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate\nSo much hate woven into these raps\nHe stitches a bitch, straight sewin'\nShit, I'm beginning to hate clothing\nI hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes\nFor Christ sake, they're shaped like an H woah and\nYou know what else starts with H though?\nHockey, shit, thought I had the place flowing\nI hate to put you on ice but\nYou already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going\nPlus you remind me of cocaine, ho\nYou always in the mirror with your face\nSo, I feel an urge to put you all in a line\nAnd chop you with a razor blade, yo wait, I'm an a-hole\nDevil with a halo\nHell yeah, I'd nail J-Lo to the railroad\nSay I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat\nWhen I take the wind out your sailboat\nBut, I ain't playing yo! Dope as Shady?\nDon't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b379811c1415017b9f3e3a71b9d26060.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eminem"}
