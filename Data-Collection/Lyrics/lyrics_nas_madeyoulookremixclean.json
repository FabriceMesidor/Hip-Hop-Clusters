Where them dimes at?\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nI'm from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows\nWhere Xs mark spots and kitchens mark Os\nWhere love's gon' getcha and hate is gon' snitch ya\nAnd fingers squeeze triggers like boa constrictors\nIt's the, Mr. Luda, Jada and Nas\nAnd our bullets give you a deep-tissue massage\nSo hear a song and dance while I make these ends\nYou never stood half a chance like Siamese Twins (AH!)\nThey shooting! Look in the barrel!\nThen he made the front page of the Miami Herald\nOr Chi. Tribune, nozzles with silent doom\nWe in that A-Town Journal as violent goons\nYou should print my information, quote my rhymes\nAnd keep me in between these New York and L.A. Times\nI was the victim of society, it's 'Cris the Menace\nWith mo' shit out on the streets than evicted tenants, whoa!\n\n[Hook: Nas]\nThey shooting! Ah, made you look\nYou a slave to a page in my rhyme book\nGettin big money, playboy your time's up\nWhere them gangsters? Where them dimes at?\n\n[Interlude: Nas]\nJungle! Wiz! Nashawn!\nWe got 'em scared, look!\nWe got 'em scared, they runnin'!\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nYo, I grasp the ratchet, the blinker, the biscuit, the burner\nThe heat, the toaster, the twister, you meetin your owner\nThe banger, the hammer, the flamers I aim at the cannons\nAnd can ya, manhandlin ya, you'll be famous, I'll cancel you\nAnd cut, that's the end of your movie\nPretendin you actin like you and your mens'll come shoot me\nMy tennis shoes Gucci, old school, pea-soup green\nJean Lee suit on, Veuve Clicquot champagne\nFriday the 13th my CD drop\nI rhyme to more Base than EZ Rock, I'm Jason, call up P.D\nWatch hem Bravehearts, Jungle and Wiz and Nashawn\nIll Will rasta Lake, never revealin his face on\nTV or pictures or even them n*****\nSorry that I made you wait long, glad them fakes gone\n\n[Outro: Nas]\nWe shooting! Squeezing them triggers with Luda beside me\nMe and 'Kiss get Luniz of weed, set to Styles P\nTell him hold his head, God's Son got him we made y'all look\nFrom San Quentin to Rikers Island to Green, Sing Sing...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23061dd2dc7e863127db561906debd27.434x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nas"}
