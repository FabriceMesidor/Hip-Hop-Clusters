Never getting old mane\nGrown, no Rogaine. Boy you play with all that food\nYou better eat the whole thing!\nIt's a family reunion, all the grandmas be moving\nRunning in 3-legged races people would cry if they losing\nWhen I was 2, my fly was blue\nWhen I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand\nWhen my, bike was all I was riding on\nJewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it I was happy still\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nThrow a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill\nIt's a muthafuckin barbeque for real\nAll these days already gone by\nMan, I ain't seen your ass in a long time\nPut a little gin in the punch\nGrandma getting crunked, just fine\nNobody give a fuck\nAll these days already gone by\nMan, I ain't seen your ass in a long time\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nCome and, step inside the Electric Slide\nSpraying squirt guns at you like it's pesticides\nSo why you buggin'... lil man stop bugging...\nI gotta, spend some time, with some friends of mine\nGet away from everything, go and rest your mind\nIt's not nothing... lil man it's not nothing...\nAll my little cousins acting like some munchkins\nRunning in the trees and they're crying out their eyes\nHave to rush em to the ER - maybe just a Band-Aid will do it\nYou can sing along please, let the band play the music\nAlways nice when you come back home\nYour friends go off but then they come back grown\nNice to know that you're never alone\nFamily reunions whenever I'm home..\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nThrow a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill\nIt's a muthafuckin barbeque for real\nAll these days already gone by\nMan, I ain't seen your ass in a long time\nPut a little gin in the punch\nGrandma getting crunked, just fine\nNobody give a fuck\nAll these days already gone by\nMan, I ain't seen your ass in a long time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/781a2ead216a063ed9bf5ff4df530fd8.275x275x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
