COOL J\nAll of this is just a story that I made up\nDef lines I say on time with Cut Creator's cuts\nSome of it's fiction, and some of it's fact\nNot another common rap with a heavy drum track\nA whole lotta rhymes, and I wrote every one\nThat story is over, and my rhyme IS DONE\nHUH!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/360d16b8aeb2fd205516a7b8c96f11b2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
