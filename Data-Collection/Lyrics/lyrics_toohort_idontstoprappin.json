rappin'\nDon't stop that rap\n\nWell I'm sir too short\nThe true mc\nFresh again with the brand new beat\nThe big bank roller, I know what's happening\nI get on the mike and I don't stop rappin'\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop that rap\nToo short\nI don't stop rappin'\n\nMy rap don't stop, you know it can't\nI get on the mic and I make big bank\nUnlike some rappers that I know\nTrying to get no, but that don't go\nI'm that rapper, sir too short\nI know you've heard my name before\nAnd if you haven't, now you have\nSir too short don't stop that rap\n\nDon't stop\nI don't stop rappin\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nI'm so rough so tough when I talk my stuff\nI don't stop rappin cuz I'm too tough\nTelling you rappers what it's all about\nMost mc's are played out\nBut not too short, I'm the best\nYou know too short is so so fresh\nIf that's not short, your mind is snapping\nThe best is fresh cause I don't stop rappin'\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop rappin'\nToo short\nI don't stop rappin'\n\nI'm sir too short, the rapping man\nI'm a cold mc and I know I am\nI'm the big time rapper from east oakland\nInto music and making fans\nI love young ladies who love my rhymes\nCuz what they say is right on time\nThe only mc with fresh hits\nIt's sir too short, he never quits\nThat's so so true, what they say\nI hear those words every day\nCause I'm an mc rapper who gives you more\nThe big time rapper, sir too short\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop rappin'\nToo short\nI don't stop rappin\n\nWhy do rappers rap like me\nBecause I rap originally\nI never ever will, sing your rap\nI'll leave it to you and it's just like that\nI sing my rap and I know you like\nThe way sir too short rocks the mic\nThe sucker mc's don't even front\nEven though too short is what they want\nCause what I say is well prepared\nI look at a rapper and I make him scared\nScared to battle, the cold cold capper\nI'll even be part on a female rapper\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop rappin'\nToo short\nI don't stop rappin'\n\nC a l I f o r\nN I a and a superstar\nThat what it is, that's what I see\nCalifornia life was made for me\nBorn and raised in the golden state\nMc rapper and you know I'm great\nJust cooling out, acting shy\nI got my mic and my rap won't stop\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop rappin'\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nI met a freak named jiggle g\nTook her on a date and spent one penny\nShe bought me dinner, I bought her gum\nTook her to my house to have some fun\nI said jiggle g, your so fresh\nYou look so fine with your big big breasts\nI spit my game to her so tough\nSir too short was coming up\nI did just what I wanted to\nBut when I finished what did I do\nI took her home, real real fast\nI charged her up for wasted gas\nI knew just what she had to say\nLets get together on our next pay day\nCuz like I said, I know what's happening\nAnd you know too cause I don't stop rappin'\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop rappin'\nSir too short\nSpit that rap\n\nOh yes baby, I'm the most\nSir too short from the west coast\nMy rap don't stop, it never could\nI'm known all in your neighborhood\nAs an mc rapper, right on time\nSucker mc's don't sing my rhymes\nCuz if they do, I'll be slapping\nSucker mc's cuz I'm all about rappin'\n\nDon't stop\nI don't stop rappin'\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nMc rappers, from the o\nYou talk about short, but you don't know\nIf you rap original\nI might kick back and watch your show\nBut if I did what would I see\nA so fake and imitating sucka mc\nIn my face trying to rap like me\nBut none of you suckas can rock that beat\nCuz you stand there looking like a sap\nAnd in your rap I hear my rap\nThe sucka mc must want my fame\nCuz he didn't stop rappin' till he heard my name\n\nDon't stop\nI don't stop rappin'\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nI'm sir too short on the mic\nGonna tell ya what kind of girls too short likes\nI like those girls that are real real fine\nThick young tenders, yours and mine\nIt's not all about getting that steak\nCuz what is a girl without a lot of bank\nA bump and a grind and she's on her knees\nThe way it is now you might catch a disease\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop that rap\nSir too short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nI don't stop rappin', just don't stop\nDon't stop rappin' don't stop don't stop\nToo short, so fresh\nI'll show you how the game comes from the west\nCuz you never ever knew that it was going on\nTill a brother like me put it in a song\nAnd I'm always fresh, never the same\nJust don't stop that fishes game\n\nDon't stop\nDon't stop that rap\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\n\nI'm sir too short, I'm that mc\nFresh again, with the beat\nI'm the big bank roller, I know what's happening\nI get on the mic and I don't stop rapping\n\nDon't stop\nI don't stop rapping\nToo short\nDon't stop that rap\nDon't stop rapping\nDon't stop that rap", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f7947ca6d18485b4713ba9c89b2980c7.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist":
