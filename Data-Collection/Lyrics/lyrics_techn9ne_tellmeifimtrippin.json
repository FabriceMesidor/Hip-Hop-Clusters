This isn't something to mess around with\nCome on, it's just a game, nothing to worry about, sit down\n(Hey, man, hand me one of those beers)\nBut it's not just a game...\nIt is, everything is gonna be fine, hand me a beer too. Come on, let's do it\n\n[Verse 3: Prozak]\nI can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994\nAnd a group of us was chilling at the table, we was drinking  with our fingers on the Ouija board\nTryna summon spirits asking \"Ouija, can you hear us?\" never thinking what was in store\nThen the dogs started barking, in the darkness, all of a sudden it was knocking at the front door\nThen we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open\nNervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion, no one was there, we went back to the board hoping\nThat we finally made contact, with the deity, apparition on the other side\nThen it started moving out and soon it was spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die\nWe decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment\nOn the way home Sarah hit a patch of ice, lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life\n\n[Bridge: Tyler Lyon]\nAm I my paranoid or scared\nWere they ever really there?\nTell me if I'm tripping\nAm I supposed to sit and wait\nWhile they storm through the gate\nPsycho just like Norman Bates\nTell me if I'm tripping\n\n[Outro]\n(coughing) Fuck that shit, nigga, hmm, let's party", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d6abef8fbc863a78647f5e7bfd58bbe7.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
