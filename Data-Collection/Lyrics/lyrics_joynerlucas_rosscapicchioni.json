Turn the car off and chill.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when I start to panic he told me, \u201cRelax.\u201d\nThen he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed\nThen my life flashed in an instant\nHe inched to my driver door then I tried to lock it, I couldn\u2019t\nRipped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then\nPulled out the shotty and all I heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces\nI\u2019m thinkin' I must be dreamin\u2019, another shot to my chest\nAnd my stomach\u2019s squeezin', my breath or my lungs collapsin\nI\u2019m down on my fuckin knees askin' him, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nHe looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes\nAnd he smashed my face with the barrel\nAnd I throw my teeth to the sky and then uh\nI heard a [cocks shotgun] sound of the shotty cock back\nHe pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back\nI\u2019m still conscious, I\u2019m breathin'\nI\u2019m still movin', no clue as to why I\u2019m not dead\nAll this blood that I\u2019m losin' and I heard my car drive off\nAnd I looked up and saw the sun and that was all that I saw\nThen I heard my conscience tell me, \u201cGet up nigga get up! You\u2019re losin' blood, oh my! Don\u2019t fall asleep or you\u2019ll die! Stay awake and move as much as possible, there\u2019s no time!
