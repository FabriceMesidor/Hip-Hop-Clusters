Cool J\nRhymes are all wack and real all real\nYo Earl, tell the party people the deal\n\n[Bridge]\nYo listen here\nYa ain't no thing, can't complain\nGet cash like a muh'fuck, pass the \"J\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nThat's right I'm back he's talks out rap\nYou used to smirk, now you're jockin' cause my name's on the map\nSit and lie my homeboy Earl says that it's a E-Love hat\nWith the hands like a hatchet, Cut Creator's in back\nCut Creator on the fader, the teacher's pet\nBaddest man with ten fingers you've ever met\nAnd sooner or later we'll house the set\nCut Creator cut the record so they don't forget\nGet down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\n\n[Verse 4]\nI make hard rock jams for hard rock fans\nWhat I'm sayin's for real, this ain't la-la land\nGot a can full of jams pullin off the lid\nCompetition in New York can't do what I did\nNo Cinderella story, I paid my dues\nI rocked at house parties I was down with crews\nNow I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's\nAnd for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes\nI'm strong like stone, hard like cement\nAnd I rocked every jam that I ever went\nCause I got a better reppin than any emcee has\nAnd I'm bad like a brother from Alcatraz\nGet down\n\n[Hook]\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L\n\n[Verse 5]\nNi-ni-nigga-nigga-ni-ni-ni\nNinja of rap, the boss is back\nThe only man you should call on when the party is packed\nFrom Paris to L.A they say I'm sharp as a pin\nWhen it's a Cool J party you gotta get in\nSo I can make you kick steps like Gladys Knight and the Pips\nOne rhyme, you're on my tip, soon as it leaves my lips\nUp the block kids are talkin and spreadin the news\nAbout the new grandmaster the one you'll choose\nCause I'm treacherous, I wanna stomp the rest\nWhat I'm kickin' couldn't bore, it can only impress\nI'm not a Hula-Hoop, this ain't no passin' phase\nHard work pays, I'm gettin straight-up A's\nCool J is runnin' things, I want it understood\nExecutioner, I should wear a black hood\nAnd carry an axe cause I'm ruff on wax\nSpeakers speakin ?phone-wear from durable? eight-tracks\nGet down\n\n[Outro]\n(G, G, G, G, G, G, Get Down)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/360d16b8aeb2fd205516a7b8c96f11b2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LL Cool J"}
