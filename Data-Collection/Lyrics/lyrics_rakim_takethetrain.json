(No)\nDid we lose them?\nSpeed it up\nWe're going too slow\nWhere's the turbo button at? (Right here\nI'ma push it)\nAnymore juice that can boost the blow\n\nStand back give me that\nI'ma play a game\nLet's see who can gain on the runaway train\nEverything is real\nSo I know I'll win\nWhile you wish you could\nI know I can\n\nIt's action pack\nI was meant for this\nHigh energy and adventurous\nLook around\nWe're going faster than the speed of sound\nAnymore faster and we'll leave the ground\n\nDay designed\nOutlined the curve\nWe zig-and-zag till we start to swerve\nSpeeding the Rugrats and them we have to come\nTake it to the maximum\n\nAll in together lets make a game\nWe can all win if we play the same\nWhoever gets caught got to take the blame\nWe gon' take the train, take the train\n\nTake it to the maximum (3x)\nRakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)\n\nRakim:\nYo, Yo, take it to the maximum, yaknahmean?\nAnd right now I want to give a major shout out to my little peoples\nTo Otis, Arlo, Gabby, Little Jamie, Jerdy, Jay, Justin, Jared\n\nDanny Saber:\nRuby, Brandon, Cory, Donny, Tyler, Jake, Lucy, Medio\n\nRakim:\nTo little people's\nTymel, Destiny, and Jabbar\nOne Love, Get your Rugrat on\nYaknahmean\nPeace\nTake it to the maximum\n\nTake it to the maximum (5x)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86c08fb5c295e6389307942799529161.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rakim"}
