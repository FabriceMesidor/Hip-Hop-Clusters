These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre\nWhich is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?\nWhile I kill the dark side's where I live\nHorny devils and a red dress and high heels\nYou don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas\nI take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bia\nYou road kill while I'm driving\nI'm high fiving, my dime riding, My time shining\nFrom at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it\nDeuce chains I'm fung shway, everyday is my birthday\n2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play\nPatron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine\nI look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about a another dime\nMy atmosphere is fractured here this right here is bally gear and I keep on killing shit\nAnd I don't even have no tatted tear\nYou can put the motherfucker caddie here\nYou can put the motherfucker beemer there\nStill got 2 more garage places, louies on I unlaced it\nEvery verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy\n2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3252379f345638f5b880f5055e0ca791.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
