What's good? I'm running through your hood\nI'm feeling like I should, I wish a motherfucker would\nBobby be my name, I'm 'bout to run a train\nOn this girl with all my boys and her name is Mary Jane\nCause I burn (big dope!) with my dogs\nJoe Clay rolled a blunt so big that shit look like a log\nIn my dressing room but I can't see through all the fog\n6ix supply the kicks like karate\nI was fighting with the idea of smokin\u2019 again and now I got my green belt\nAnd that\u2019s the longest line without a rhyme\nBut the punch before the line about the line was so divine\nFor shizzle my nizzle, I feel like D-O-double Gizzle on this grizzle, my nizzle\nPut the greenery on the grill and let it sizzle, my nizzle\nIt don't matter the season Bobby let it burn when it drizzle\nAnd boy I\u2019m liable to put my right hand on the Bible\nAnd tell the world that me and Berner got a strain of the cookie\nThat shit is so simply just undeniable\nIt'll make your world shatter like glass and I ain't talkin' \u2019bout them dabs\n\n[Interlude: Logic]\n(Woo-hah!)
