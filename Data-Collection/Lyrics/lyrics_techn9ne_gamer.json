Wonder how well the picture went\nThe one I saw was Twitter sent, saw through mommy like Mr.Kent\nLookin like her kissers were whistling to get liquor bent\nOr wishing for me to stick her in a position to dip I get her hint\nA hundred points she gets cause we connected\nFive hundred points for the number that tech direct texted\nBonus three hundred if she come over and get naked\nBut a stinky crevice took her to nothing, girl take the exit\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nI'm a game, she the game\nI'm a player, you not the same\nWho to loose, who to blame\nDon't hate the player, hate the game\nI can be your super lover babe if you just let me in\nBaby it ain't hard to play the game but maybe hard to win\nIt's a roller coaster ride come on as I give it a spin\nPlay it right you get an extra man baby\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nNext player she say shes the best slayer\nShe love when her breasts bare\nWith hot candle wax, that's rare\nSix hundred points when she say her and her girl is a sex pair\nThat'll get you an extra man now we gamin on that there\n\n[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]\nBaby you doing good, stay on it picked up an extra man\nThe only way to use that bonus is if a sexy friend\nEqually fine as you may join us to pass the test\nTo slam fingers in and then out on your own personal message can\nSkype is so exciting and virtual when two tight women ignite\nIn a delightfulness of dyking in about five minutes\nYou might just win it yet, but now your girl looking up tight with it\nLack of participation got your points steadily spiking\nAnd if five hundred points is important\nThen let your mind body and souls free\nKeep your opponents from trying to score these\nMighty sluttin' up with just seconds left on the board 3-\n2-1 and on to the next ones cause these bore me\nBecause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]\nEleven Hundred points mommy looked smelled and taste good\nBut lost it from telling it all on Facebook\nOne got a dinner, the other from Twitter was using a fake picture\nAnd in the end weren't none of them winners\n'Til I met this girl from Tagged.com\nGot to meet me, whip me, and she be freaky deaky\nGot the dinner, a movie and plus a repeat\nHighest score ever, but I broke the broad\nSay you came close but no cigar my minds primed\n\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nGaming on ya, even if you got some good head\nHood said you keep the pood fed 'til the woods dead\nIf you happen to get into bed with me\nThen you'll spread quickly and do a medley of ooh and yeahs\nWith me, and that's a thousand points if you get that\nDinner is a thousand mo you can get it if you with that\nGood conversation can probably get you diamond knickknacks\nBut a misshap like bloggin' about how I did that, give my shit back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nThank you for playing Gamer\nCongrats if you are the winner\nSorry and shit if you are a loser\nIf indeed you failed\nPlease come again\nBut remember\nContinuous play may cause extreme nausea\nAnd often results can be fatal\n-Game Over-", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7efd1fa33fbd953a08bc1d44fae9f6a7.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
