The artwork has been duplicated, the work ethic has been emulated, the title alone is a daily discussion within hip hop. How does it feel to have that impact? Okay first of all, that was all something new to me. So, I ain't know it was the best mixtape series of all time, I totally didn't, forgive me, I don't know...just didn't..um. The artwork been duplicated? I honestly don't even be doing my artwork I swear, I just be too busy, just moving, gotta get to the next. I'm sorry, uh, the work ethic has been emulated? Now that right there...uhhhhh..I don't know right there...I don't know...I don't know about the work ethic being emulated man...yeah I don't know, uh. The title alone is a daily discussion within hip hop? How does it feel to have that impact? Um, dedication! Yeah dedicate yourself to something man, dedicate it to something man. If yourself isn't in your music its still you, that's your words, dedicate it to something man it has to be dedicated to something, and it only means that you're dedicated. You're a dedicated person. I am a very dedicated person, to everything I love, everything, everyone. Very very very dedicated. And that what Dedication 6 about. But it is some six shit. Some very sick shit. So yeah, dedication six six six yourself. To hell. Thank you!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7eee606ac8ea7a0565130c6e3ee4cd0e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lil Wayne"}
