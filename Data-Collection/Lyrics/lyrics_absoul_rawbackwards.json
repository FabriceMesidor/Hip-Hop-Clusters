Another baptism by Pastor Black Lip\nI'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive\nI'm low-key, like a locksmith workin' on both knees\nYou nosy, wiretap vans, got fur where my toes be\nI'm cozy, act like you know me\nWicked as Aleister Crowley, I just might OD\nOverly dedicated, just like my homie\nSecond to none in the first place, I need a trophy\nDoing whatever I please, it's like, \"Fuck your feelings!\"\nMan, I got so many flows, them shits come with ceilings\nWhat's my name? They call me Ab-Soul, the Abstract Asshole\nI'm levitatin', way too crazy\nWay too wavy for your sandcastle\n\n[Chorus: Ab-Soul]\nAyy, man, what\u2019s happenin'?\nAnother baptism by Pastor Black Lip\nI'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive\nThe Backwoods with the gas in it\nYou roll the raw, I spell it backwards\nThrow that wack shit up in the trash can\n\n[Post-Chorus: Zacari]\nWe don't wanna hear that wack shit no more\nNo more\nNo more, no more\nNo more, no more\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nI'm goin' loco, this nigga Soulo back in this ho though\nOh no, you watchin' Hulu, I run the show though\nIs it music? Voodoo? I don't know\nBut don't confuse me with D'Angelo, I'm the angel though\nSpooky, hope your army got lots of armor\n\u2018Cause we don't die, we just multiply, divide and conquer\nRemember when the Battle Mongers called me a reject\n'Til I had all this heart and honor, demand my respect\nNow I walk through C-A-R-son like I'm a hero\nSteps ahead and stackin' bread up, speakin' of heroes\n4-7 shit, fuck it, fly to the Beast Coast\nJust to sag down Troy Ave quotin' King Steelo\nPass the pot, let me skillet\nThe temperature is scaldin', the novices make me nauseous\nI was like a swami of Jay Electronica until he figured\nDizzle wouldn't admit that he would body him for a milli\nI told Kenny keep quiet, I'ma get him\nWe don't need dirt on your hands, gettin' the key to the city\nYou feel me? Hurts when your OG\nWho's supposed to be a G-O-D\nIs standin' next to King Kunta feelin' like Toby\nYeah, Moos, what I gotta do, boy?\nI'm just waitin' on your cue to take him to school, boy\nYeah, but fuck all this wordplay\nTop, tell these fuckin' stooges I'm dangerous, keep away\nMayday (Soul!)\n\n[Bridge: Ab-Soul]\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\n\n[Chorus: Ab-Soul]\nAyy, man, what\u2019s happenin'?\nAnother baptism by Pastor Black Lip\nI'm mashin' across the masses, my movement massive\nThe Backwoods with the gas in it\nYou roll the raw, I spell it backwards\nThrow that wack shit up in the trash can\n\n[Post-Chorus: Zacari]\nWe don't wanna hear that wack shit no more\nNo more\nNo more, no more\nNo more, no more\n\n[Bridge: Ab-Soul]\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\nRaw backwards on all you rappers\n\n[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]\nI\u2019m Wiccan like a wicked witch, I need Alia Zin\nTo read Genesis, yeah\n\u2018Cause this one for my fellow Thelemites about that fuckin' life\nYou fuckin' right, I need to stand up for my fuckin' rights\nOut of sight, out of mind, still leave insight in your brain\nGot your synapses doin' jumping jacks and all kind of things\nI mean check my subject range\nAgartha, dopamine, choppers, stick talk, Benihana, PF Chang's\nRevelations reiterated, this revolutionary\nShit you bump that gives you goosebumps\n\u2018Cause the truth is scary\n(Do what thou wilt) I\u2019m not talented, I\u2019m skilled\n(I\u2019m the darkest knight) With the shiniest shield\nWould\u2019ve attended a university, but it was silly to me\nBecause the whole universe is just a city to me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/216d5ad8aa97fe78835ee2f384785ee8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
