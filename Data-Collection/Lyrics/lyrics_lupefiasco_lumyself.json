Am I speaking Spanish B?\nWell adios holmes, am I getting sloppy Joe? Well what am I, a Manwich B?\nI got a Big Mac if you want a sandwich G\nWho else you know keep the Mickey D tucked\nWith the windy on his shoulder? I told ya, give it up dog, it\u2019s over", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd4d83021b7debccabee0705b6c17c4e.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lupe Fiasco"}
