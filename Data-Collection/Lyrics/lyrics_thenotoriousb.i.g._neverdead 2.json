I got the hookers eating out my palm\nShe grabbed my arm and said \"Let's leave calm\"\nI'm hitting skins again\nRolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken\nNiggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out\nBlows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out\n\n[2pac]\n\nI live Thug Life, and let the money come to me\nCause they can never take the game from a young G\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[2pac: Verse 4]\n\nStill on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'\nPour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it\nIf I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'\nKinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'\nDressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block\nJust a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops\nGettin' high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends\nI'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz\nI hit the strip I let my music buck\nDrinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck\nRather die makin' money, than live poor and legal\nAs I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo\n\n[Biggie: Verse 5]\n\nSo I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side\nHow I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside\nBed-Stuy: the place where my head rests\n50-shot clip if a nigga want test\nThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya\nHigh as a motherfucking helicopter\nThat's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor\nBeating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina\n\n[2pac: Verse 6]\n\nThey couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me\nThe marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy\nI traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year\nI felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here\nNever did like the police, let the whole world know\nNow I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down\nAnd facin' me now, what do I do?\nThese things that a Thug goes through\nAnd still I rise", "image": "https://images.genius.com/accf2df97375292b16f399ff6ec71e6e.500x500x1.png"}], "artist": "The Notorious B.I.G."}
