(Why?)\nTrippin' 'cause you know the bomb's at where I'm at\nWell if that's the case you shoulda rolled\nWit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)\nThis is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue\nMe, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop\nNiggas from sets be tryin' to set you up 'cause you set in your ways\nSo ask DJ Pooh what pays\n\n[Chorus]\nUp jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nWhile you're bangin' on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang\nAnd if I'm bangin' it's with DPG\nThey say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nWhile you're bangin' on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang\nAnd if I'm bangin' it's with DPG\n\n[Verse 3: Snoop]\nJust what we need, bangin' on wax, another Crip\n(What's up, cuz?)\nWhat you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?\nYou're like a actor wit another script\nPredictable as Rambo wit another clip (busta)\nHow many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?\nYou need to sit down and learn to get down first\n'Cause, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers\nNot part-time FBI singers\nNiggas having bad intentions, sending BG's on a mission\nOne move too many, nigga you missin'\nListen, you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no\nLoony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D\nNiggas got too flossy from all the sacs they tossin'\nAnd guess what it cost me, they crossed me\nBut before I give a nigga a 9\nI'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme\n\n[Chorus]\nUp jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nWhile you're bangin' on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang\nAnd if I'm bangin' it's with DPG\nThey say up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nWhile you're bangin' on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang\nAnd if I'm bangin' it's with DPG\n\nUp jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nWhile you're bangin' on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang bang\nAnd if I'm bangin' it's with DPG", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ecb7c80ab44a68c9d33f60b5fccd0a70.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Snoop Dogg"}
