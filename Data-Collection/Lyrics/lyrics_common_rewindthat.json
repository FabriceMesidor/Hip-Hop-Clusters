He's one of the greatest producers... greatest musicians of our time. For real, I really know that\n\nLike, I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats being made. You know, I really, really used to walk by and be like, \"Man, I'm blessed.\" I really felt that, like, during the time when he was making it, not like, I don't look back and have to say \"I was blessed, I know I was blessed.\" But during that time I looked and say man, I'm gonna see Jay Dee make beats every day, you know, as long as he was healthy, he was making music\n\n(J Dilla)\nCommon, ok for me, ok it's definitely not a Common album\nBut, it's Common", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e188205739dfac1fc84a3288836b46ff.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Common"}
