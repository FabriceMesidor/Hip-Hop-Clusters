With a .40 what I'm gon' do?\nI'ma\u200b merk 'em\n\n[Verse]\nUh, that's a play on play, close the curtains\nAll this heartbreak shit blow like his name Kurtis\nAll she ever do is do blow and make me nervous\nThis a AP, not a Hublot\nBut let me stay focused\nLotti, Lotti you know, if you leave me\nYou're asking for the gun smoke\nThis is real, no cap, baby, no joke\nYou are my home, crack a smile when your name surfaces on my phone\nRemember when I was in Europe, we was in a different time zone\nConversations, what we still made time for\nBy the way, I pop molly\nI don't rock Tom Ford\nMy hobbies are catching bodies, riding bikes and skateboards\nInstagram like \"look at juice new girl\"\nSome of y'all is really fucking with his new girl\nBut some of y'all are like \"Fuck her, that's his new girl\"\nLike who the hell invited her to live in juice world?\"\nI think Juice WRLD invited her to live in juice world\nThat's juice girl, nigga, that's not your girl (uh)\nSo with that being said\nI'm holding her close, I'm taking off clothes\nI'm taking her soul, I'm letting her know\nThat she really make me whole\n\n[Chorus]\nShe told me that we perfect\nSo if we break up, I'm gon' turn into a serpent\nShe got a new nigga, well I'll be in they bushes lurkin'\nWith what? With a .40 what I'm gon' do?\nI'ma\u200b merk 'em\nShe told me that we perfect\nSo if we break up, I'm gon' turn into a serpent\nShe got a new nigga, well I'll be in they bushes lurkin'\nWith what?
