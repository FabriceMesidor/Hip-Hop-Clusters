What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing? What are we doing here?\nWhat are we doing?\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn a late night weekend showcase event\nKinda liked you at first but I noticed your friend\nSo I got my folk to approach both of them\nAnd they both came over and poured up some Hen\nAnd we ain't say much but we spoke\nCause you don't have to speak when you know\nTheir eyes said to me \"Systems go\"\nIts about that time we should go\nSo allow me to flow as I propose a toast\nTo the good life, on a good night we go, grab a bottle and go\nTell her hold on, yes a beautiful night, colorful Kodak photo\nBut as soon as you enter the room I guess you froze\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIts the end of the week but the first of the month\nWhen the moon gets full but the night is still young\nWith a crowd like this you dont know where you'll end up\nSo I just play it cool like the cubes in my cup\nHuh...but then you came through tryna body me up\nAnd I ain't know what you was thinkin' but your eyes said enough\nAnd everything we felt was obviously lust\nWhich I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonn' bluff\nBut look at the clock its about time that I duck\nOutta the door dont mean to be in a rush but later\nYou can hit me up so you hit me up shoes at the door\nSmoke in the air, temperature's up\nBut I guess when the lights went out it froze you up\n\n[Refrain]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a3389828b8e82878033f8e842711c94.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
