How?\nIf it wasn't for the true-school your bitch-ass wouldn't be here now\nBlau blau, show me respect from the gate\nOr I'mma have to drown you kids like Andrea Yates\nYou can't handle the break, I'm a flamethrower, you a bic lighter\nYou think I'm cocky cuz you a dick rider\nI spit tighter, I'm not like all the rest\nI'm not a playa, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express\nSo nevertheless I'mma teach ya, teach ya\nBut when them slugs hit you, you'll be screaming, \"Momma, EI! EI!\"\nYou never seen me sing? You don't know what I bring?\nYou'll be singing the blues like B.B. King\nI'm all about the unity of Miss and Mistas\nYou all about grabbing money and dissing our sistas\nTake your ass back to TV land\nAnd let this be a lesson, you can't see me, man!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust when I thought I could do my gospel\nAnd become an apostle I got a whole to get hostile\nI don't mean to knock ya Nelly\nBut ain't you that MTV house nigga with a spine like jelly?\nI'mma do this by the book, for the art\nI heard what you said on BET's 106 and Park\nBut what you don't know, is right around the corner on 3rd\nI hold a Desert Eagle, and no, it's not a bird\nYou sound absurd, you're gonna bring me back?\nI taught all year round the spot ??? had\nYou copycat, with sloppy raps\nYou chill with N'Sync, I chill where hip-hop be at\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47add5b76aff66374496d71d637e04ca.220x222x1.jpg"}], "artist": "KRS-One"}
