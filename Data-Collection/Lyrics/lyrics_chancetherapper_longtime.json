Vous ne pensez qu'\u00e0 \u00e7a\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, it's been a long time, long time now\nSince I've seen you smile\nAnd I'll gamble away my fright\nAnd I'll gamble away my time\nAnd in a year, a year or so\nThis will slip into the sea\nWell, it's been a long time, long time now\n(Oh, it's, oh, it's been so long)\nSince I've seen you smile\n(It's been so long)\n\n[Outro]\nSaid it's been a long time, long time now, now, now\nSaid it's been a long time, long time now\nAnd it's been a long time, long time now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04c687414ea567ebf44f05a92c3e86ff.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Chance the Rapper"}
