I\u2019m praying for a flood\nIt feel like time passing me by slower than a slug\nWhile this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug\nWill you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?\nTell me you love me, need me\nPromise me you\u2019ll never leave me\nEven though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street\nWith a fist to match, more solid than concrete\nTell white people I\u2019m black, feel the need to retreat\nLike I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik\nBut my beautiful black brothers and sisters\nWant to act like I\u2019m adopted\nGo back in time to when my nigga daddy\nImpregnated my cracker momma and stopped it\n\n[Refrain: Logic]\nMy oh my (My oh my)\nOh my (My oh my)\nI said oh my (Oh my)\n\n[Verse 2: Logic]\nSomebody pinch me\nBlack man screaming, trying to convince me I\u2019m not black\nSo why the white man wanna lynch me?\nDamn, my skin fair but life\u2019s not\nAnd I'd be lying if I said I didn\u2019t care what whites thought\nOr black people said, shit\nMaybe it\u2019s in my head\nLike a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\nLooking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her\nPraying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her\nFeeling like the devil finna come and defeat her\nAll alone in the wintertime, close to the heater\nWondering what\u2019s gonna happen\nAnd how the world gonna treat her\nHow could her momma mislead her\nAnd her daddy just leave her?\nLike abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever\nOh my\n\n[Chorus: Logic]\n(Oh my) Oh my\n(Oh my) Like the white woman said oh my\nOh my, my, my, my, my\nOhhh\nOh my, my, my, my, my\nOh my\nI don\u2019t feel right deep inside\nFeeling like I need to hide\nEverybody wonder why I get high\n'Cause I can\u2019t fight the feeling inside\nOh my, my, my\nOh my, I said oh my, yeah\n\n[Verse 3: Logic]\nFeeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence\nAnd all this shit is so intense\nDon\u2019t wanna go to this event\nJust wanna stay home and invent\nAnd somehow, yeah, that let me vent\nI\u2019m taking shots and drinking liquor\nBut that shit don\u2019t make a dent in how I\u2019m feeling\nAnd yes I\u2019m willing to keep chilling on this shit\nI know there's someone out there far away\nWho's feeling all this shit\nAnd yes I know that when I\u2019m low\nThere's so much further I can go\nAnd so I look up to the sky\nOh my, oh my\n\n[Refrain: Logic]\n(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my\n(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my\n(Oh my, oh my) Oh my, oh my\n(I said oh)\n\n[Verse 4: Logic]\nI feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a

What advice can you give me?\nGod: What advice can I give humanity?\nAtom: I suppose so\nGod: Live your life. Don\u2019t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you\u2019re not your salary. You\u2019re not your house. You\u2019re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else\u2019s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all\nKai: Damn man, we\u2019ve been walking forever\nThomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we\u2019ll be there in just over an hour\nKai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?\nThomas: Oh no, man. I\u2019m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\nOne, two, three, four\nOne, two, three, four, listen\nLook into my eyes\nTell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on\nThis front that I'm puttin' up for you\nI spill my soul into a microphone\nWith poems written in blood\nIn hopes that it's enough for you\nDo you love me yet?\nDo you love me yet?\nNo? Okay\nI'll go harder for you\nIn fact, I rap till I collapse\nAll I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson\nI'll never feel your approval till I accept my own\nCome from a messed up home, destitute and less informed\nAbout the ways to raise a child up\nTo not become a product\nOf his environment, I need to cry and vent\nBut I done built this wall up\nActin' like everything's all good\nBut in reality I'm lookin' for something\nThrough bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after\nNas, Cole, and Hov\nEyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'\nI'm used to being alone\nShit, you know how long I've been out on my own?\nChasing dreams, fantasies of a throne\nOne day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along\nTill then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant\nBoosting my ego with every million that spills in\nAnd still then\nI won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?\nWorrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap\nWhen it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved\nBy parents that was in too deep with the drugs\nNigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit\nBe who you are, identify as a star\nNo one tells you you're that\nIt's something that you just know\nThe world be stealing your glow\nYour mama did what she could\nHer life was miles from good\nYour father fell in the trap\nThey set for you when you black\nThey met when they was low\nAnd therefore you a product of that\nAnd so your trauma is deep\nDon't bury it you should weep\nAnd clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em\nJust my opinion, only then can you find peace\nJust start to notice happiness don't come from album release\nI've been through it before\nCan only share with you what I know\nTo be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you\nAnd you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try\nThis is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly\nThe truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky\nBut if you want to then you ought to know why\nAre you running from something\nWith hopes of becoming someone\nThat's finally worthy of love\nLet me tell you now, you're worthy enough\nFuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell\nFind God, learn to accept yourself\nAnd I'm gone, acceptance", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a2c364a06d2844fd9e294ee0ea798ff.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Logic"}
