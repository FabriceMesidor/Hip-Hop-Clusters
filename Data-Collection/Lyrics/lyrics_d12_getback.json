Nigga, you can forget it\nBitch suck my *dick* that is the radio edit\nI'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe\nI ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fucking assholes\nBattle me? You better go eat your vegetables\nI'm iller than a Muslim eating a pork hot dog at an African festival\nThis shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane\nResort to pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained\n\n[Eminem]\nGet back, get back\nYou better get back, get back back\n\nYou better get back, get back\nYou better get back, get back back [repeat both lines 5x]\nYou better get the FUCK back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b74638dde90c92c22113c17a8a32b4ba.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D12"}
